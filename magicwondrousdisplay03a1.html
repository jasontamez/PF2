Description

This rune-carved wooden statuette of a fish feels very slippery. When placed at the helm of any Large water vehicle (such as a rowboat or ship's boat), the friction between the boat and water is reduced considerably, allowing the boat to glide through the water more smoothly and swiftly. The boat gains a foot enhancement bonus to its maximum speeds.
