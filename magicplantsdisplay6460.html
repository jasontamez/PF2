Description

This massive tree bears no leaves, and its branches are twisted and vile. A creature tied to the tree becomes more susceptible to influence, taking a -4 penalty on Will saves, Sense Motive checks, and opposed Charisma checks. In addition, once per day, a character can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check to force a creature tied to the tree to tell the truth, as if the target had failed a save within a zone of truth.

A tree of woe is potent year round, but it can have a new creature lashed to it only once per month.

Construction

Requirements Cultivate Magic Plant, charm monster, zone of truth, cultivator must have 6 ranks in Knowledge (nature); Cost 10,000 gp
