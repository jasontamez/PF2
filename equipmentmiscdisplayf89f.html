This metal container holds 4 gallons of water. As a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can use the hand pump and hose at the top to spray water up to 10 feet away. Pumping uses 1 gallon of water for every round of use and can extinguish nonmagical fires in 1 square. A full canister weighs 37 pounds.
