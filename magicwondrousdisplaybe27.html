Description

This carved cacodaemon skull bears dozens of sharp teeth and is strung on a thin iron chain adorned with vertebrae. Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can use the skull to draw forth the life essence of a dying or recently dead creature to cast create soul gem. The wearer can ingest this soul gem as a standard action. This frees the soul within the gem, which can be raised from the dead normally. The wearer then gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the consumed soul's Hit Dice when it was still living. Draining a soul with the necklace or consuming a soul gem is an evil act.
