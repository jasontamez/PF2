Description

This rod is fashioned in the form of a uraeus (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Osirion, Legacy of Pharaohs 63), the legendary two-headed winged cobra that is the symbol of the Ancient Osirian deity Wadjet, patron of Osirion and the goddess of good serpents, the River Sphinx, and wisdom. The priesthood of Wadjet is credited with creating the first rods of the uraeus, but others have since replicated the feat.

A rod of the uraeus can be wielded as a +1 light mace. When holding the rod, the wielder gains a +2 resistance bonus on Reflex saves and a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks. The wielder can fire a 30-foot line of stinging poison from the rod up to twice per day (once for each head of the uraeus). A creature in the area of effect can avoid the poison with a successful DC 13 Reflex save. On a failed save, a creature is blinded and paralyzed for 8 rounds. Each round on its turn, an affected creature may attempt a DC 13 Fortitude save to end the blindness and paralysis effects. A rod of the uraeus functions only if its possessor is lawful.
