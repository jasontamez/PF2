Description

When this plain leather badge is sewn onto a summoner's
armor or clothing, a faded image of his summoner rune
appears on its surface. The summoner can add charges to
the badge by expending summoner spells slots; the badge
gains charges equal to the spell level of the slot expended
(maximum 5 charges). Adding charges to the badge is a
standard action (regardless of the spell level expended).
When the summoner uses his life link ability, instead of
sacrificing his own hit points, he may expend charges from
the badge to heal the eidolon 1d6 hit points per charge.
The summoner does not have to decide how many charges
are spent beforehand (he may expend one charge, roll,
and decide whether or not to spend more charges for
more healing). All charges in the badge are lost when the
summoner readies spells after resting.
