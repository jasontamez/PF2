Rage Powers - Barbarian (Unchained)









Barbarian (Unchained) Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained</a>
As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the barbarian gains a rage power. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging. Some of these powers are always active during a rage, and others require the barbarian to take an action to use them. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Defensive Rage Powers


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Clear Mind (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 10</a>):  When the barbarian fails a Will saving throw, she can attempt another Will saving throw at the end of her next turn (using the original DC). If the second saving throw is successful, the barbarian is treated as if she succeeded at the first saving throw, negating or reducing the effect as determined by the spell or effect. If this second saving throw fails, the barbarian suffers the full effects of the spell or effect as normal. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Eater of Magic (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 10</a>):  When the barbarian succeeds at a saving throw to resist a spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability, she gains temporary hit points equal to the spell's level (in the case of spells or spell-like abilities) or 1/2 the CR of the effect's creator (in the case of supernatural abilities). These temporary hit points disappear when the barbarian's rage ends, and they stack with her temporary hit points from rage but not with other temporary hit points gained from this rage power. A barbarian must have the superstition rage power and be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Energy Absorption (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 10</a>):  Once per day, the barbarian can absorb the energy from a single attack that deals damage of the energy type she resists with the energy resistance rage power. She takes no damage from the attack and doesn't attempt a saving throw. Instead, she increases the temporary hit points from her rage by an amount equal to 1/2 the damage she would have taken (ignoring her energy resistance). If the barbarian is at least 16th level, once before her rage ends, she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. The breath weapon deals an amount of damage equal to the full amount the barbarian would have taken from the absorbed effect. Creatures affected by the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + her Constitution modifier). She retains the temporary hit points from this ability even if she unleashes this breath weapon. A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power and be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Energy Resistance (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). At 8th level, she gains limited immunity to the same type of energy, as protection from energy. She can absorb 2 points of damage per level, and she applies her energy resistance first. The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected, and it can't be changed. This rage power can be selected more than once; each time, it applies to a different energy type.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Fearless Rage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions (but not the panicked condition). A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Flesh Wound (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  Once per day, the barbarian can avoid serious harm from an attack. She attempts a Fortitude save with a DC equal to the damage that would be dealt by the attack. If she succeeds, she takes no damage from the attack. If she fails, she takes half damage from the attack and the damage is nonlethal. The barbarian must elect to use this ability after the attack roll is made, but before the damage is rolled. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ghost Rager (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 27</a>): While raging, the barbarian deals normal damage to incorporeal creatures even when using nonmagical weapons.
She also gains a +3 morale bonus to touch AC, which increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +7 at 20th level). This can't raise her touch AC above her full AC.. A barbarian must be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Good for What Ails You (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian who takes a drink of alcohol may attempt a new saving throw against one of the following conditions that may be affecting her: blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or sickened. If she succeeds at the save, the effect is suppressed for the duration of the rage. She also may attempt a new saving throw if poisoned; a successful save counts against those required for a cure, but a failed save has no ill effect. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Guarded Life (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, if the barbarian is reduced below 0 hit points, 1 hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. If the barbarian is at negative hit points due to lethal damage, she immediately stabilizes. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Guarded Life, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 27</a>):  When using the guarded life rage power, 1 additional hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. A barbarian must have the guarded life rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Increased Damage Reduction (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian's damage reduction increases by 2/- whenever she is raging. A barbarian can select this rage power up to three times. Its effects stack. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Internal Fortitude (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian is immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Inured to the Dead (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws3">Pathfinder #139: The Dead Road pg. 67</a>): Once per rage, when the barbarian fails a saving throw against an effect created by an undead creature, she can reroll the saving throw. She must use the second result, even if it is worse. This does not require spending an action. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Liquid Courage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian increases her morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects by +1 for each alcoholic drink she consumes during her rage, to a maximum of +1 increase per four barbarian levels. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Protect Vitals (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  While in the guarded stance, the barbarian gains an additional +4 dodge bonus to AC against attack rolls made to confirm critical hits. A barbarian must have the guarded stance rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Reflexive Dodge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  While in the guarded stance, the barbarian can apply her dodge bonus to AC as a bonus on Reflex saving throws. A barbarian must have the guarded stance rage power and be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Renewed Vigor (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  As a standard action, the barbarian heals 1d8 points of damage + her Constitution modifier. For every 4 levels the barbarian has beyond 4th, the amount healed increases by 1d8 (to a maximum of 5d8 at 20th level). This ability can be used only once per day. The barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Renewed Vitality (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  The barbarian ignores the effect of 1 point of ability penalty or ability damage per 2 levels she has (maximum 10). At 6th level, the barbarian can also ignore 1 negative level per 4 levels she has. She takes the full effects of the ability penalties, ability damage, or negative levels once her rage ends.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Spiritual Awareness (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws3">Pathfinder #139: The Dead Road pg. 67</a>): While raging, the barbarian's dodge bonus to AC from trap sense applies against attacks made by incorporeal creatures. The barbarian must have trap sense to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Spring Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian's rage rejuvenates her physically and spiritually. While raging, she ignores penalties to her ability scores due to aging. She also ignores penalties from negative levels, though she retains any negative levels she has until they are removed normally. A barbarian can have only one season-themed rage power, choosing between spring, summer, autumn, or winter rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Staggering Drunk (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 77</a>):  While raging, a barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity for each alcoholic drink she has consumed during her rage, to a maximum of +1 per four barbarian levels.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Superstition (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  The barbarian gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws made to resist spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. The barbarian cannot be the willing target of any spell and must attempt saving throws to resist all spells, even those cast by allies.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Unrestrained Rage (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws3">Pathfinder #139: The Dead Road pg. 67</a>): While raging, the barbarian is immune to paralysis. If the barbarian is targeted by an effect that would cause her to become paralyzed, she can enter a rage as an immediate action, as long as she still has rounds of rage remaining.
