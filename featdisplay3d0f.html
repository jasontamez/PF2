Your spells cover targets across a larger area.

Prerequisites: Caster level 3rd.

Benefit: You can alter a spell that targets a number of creatures no more than 30 feet apart, such as haste. The maximum distance apart of those you target with the spell increases to 60 feet. A vast spell uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.
