Your strikes tear at an opponent's flesh, inflicting serious wounds, and you can unleash all of your pent-up rage in a single powerful blow.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplaydff1.html?ItemName=Blood%20Frenzy%20Style">Blood Frenzy Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +4, aquatic subtype.

Benefit: While you are using Blood Frenzy Style, when you damage an opponent with your unarmed strikes or natural attacks, you deal an extra 1d6 points of bleed damage; this bleed damage does not stack with itself. Once every 1d4 rounds, you can make an unarmed attack with a -5 penalty; if you hit, you deal an additional 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage.
