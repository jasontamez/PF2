Description

Behind the head of this arrow is a small receptacle of alchemical material that heats up when exposed to air and eventually combusts; barbs on the arrowhead pierce the pouch when it hits a target. IF you hit a target with a slow burn arrow, it deals damage as normal, but at the beginning of your next turn, the arrow bursts into flames and deals 1d6 points of fire damage to the target.
