Description

This special ability can be placed only on light or one-handed piercing melee weapons. Weapons with this enhancement are particularly devastating in the hands of a swashbuckler. Anytime the weapon threatens a critical hit, the wielder can spend 1 panache point as an immediate action to automatically confirm the critical hit. When the swashbuckler confirms a critical hit in this fashion, she doesn't regain panache for confirming the critical hit, though she can regain panache normally if the attack is a killing blow.
