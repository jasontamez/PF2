Wherever the PCs go, there will be creatures, dangerous sites, and places to congregate-the dungeons, NPCs, and settlements that are central to nearly every adventure. The temptation might be to just reskin these features to match the plane's flavor, but that superficiality is insufficient; the plane should be an integral part of the setting and the players' experiences. That includes everything from the textures of surfaces to the planar traits that rewrite reality to the ways in which the plane's cultures (or other inhabitants) adapt to meet these odd standards.

This is especially true in the Outer Planes, where powerful alignment traits can shape environments and many inhabitants have gods for neighbors.

As an example, filling a dungeon that is located in Hell with <a href="monsterfamiliesd73f.html?ItemName=Devil">devils</a> is a disservice. Instead, consider what abilities are commonly available to local creatures (e.g., teleportation) and how those abilities might shape the denizens' behaviors in this infernal citadel. If the site is constructed from evocative materials, with walls made from ever-burning bones or floors composed of tombstones, don't stop at asking why it's that way-think about what effect those choices have on the intended inhabitants and the intruding PCs. If there's a fiend-operated market nearby, consider acceptable currency, how the traditional marketplace interactions might differ from those of the PCs' home world, what's being sold, and who the expected customers are (outsiders have fairly limited needs, after all).
