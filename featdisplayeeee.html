You have been dead for so long you have become quite difficult to kill.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb9ff.html?ItemName=Sleeper">Sleeper</a>, <a href="featdisplay7ca8.html?ItemName=Warren%20Digger">Warren Digger</a>, creature has been a ghoul for at least 500 years.

Benefit:  When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you are not destroyed-you cannot be killed unless your body is completely destroyed with fire or doused in holy water, or you take damage from a cure spell or channeled positive energy after you've been reduced to 0 hit points. Anytime you are reduced to 0 hit points, you remain unconscious until you are healed or until the following midnight, at which time you regain 1 hit point per Hit Die and awaken.
