Description

This especially powerful dowsing rod (see page 248) is typically made of a branch from an ancient tree or shafts forged of rare metals. When used for the dowsing skill unlock in place of a mundane dowsing rod, a witching rod provides a +5 circumstance bonus on the Survival check.

A witching rod can not only detect bodies of water, grave sites, and metal deposits, but can also manipulate substances or souls related to them. The rod can produce the effects of control water, speak with dead (DC 14), or stone shape. Though this ability can typically be used only once per day, a wielder with the ability to use the dowsing occult skill unlock more than once per day can instead produce a spell effect one additional time per day for each additional use of dowsing she has. This doesn't require her to expend uses of dowsing. Only one creature can produce extra uses of the witching rod in this way each day.
