Description

This item is the equivalent of a healer's kit, except its materials are especially suitable for treating common animals (cats, dogs, goats, oxen, sheep, and so on). It provides a +3 circumstance bonus on Heal checks to treat animals, but only a +1 circumstance bonus on Heal checks on other creatures. A veterinarian's kit is exhausted after 10 uses.
