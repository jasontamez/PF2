Description

Sewn in the traditional style of the Kalistocracy, this white robe bears several golden embellishments. The robe is under a constant prestidigitation spell that removes any dirt or stains while preventing wrinkles. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can repel one creature physically touching her (such as a creature targeting her with a touch spell or a combat maneuver). The target of this effect takes 5d4 points of force damage and is pushed 10 feet in a direction specified by the wearer.
