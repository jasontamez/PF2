Description

This crimson liquid roils when held. For 1 hour after drinking this tincture, you gain immunity to effects that would cause you to become shaken; you are still susceptible to becoming frightened or panicked. The drink clouds your judgment, imposing a -2 penalty on Wisdom-based skill checks for the same duration.
