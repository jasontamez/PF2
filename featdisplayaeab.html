You have learned to plant the seeds of your own doubt in the minds of others by way of your hexes.

Prerequisites: Hex class feature, <a href="featdisplay35a5.html?ItemName=Divine%20Defiance">Divine Defiance.</a>

Benefit:  As long as a creature is subject to one of your hexes, it gains a +1 luck bonus on Will saving throws and can't help but doubt and resist divine magic. Whenever an affected creature is subject to a divine spell or spelllike ability granted by a divine spellcasting class, that creature must attempt a saving throw if at all possible, even if the effect is harmless, cast by an ally, or cast by the creature itself.
