Description

Embroidered with sapphires, this blue sash stands out in stark contrast to the fiery tones of the City of Brass. Emissary's sashes mark contacts whose business necessitates visiting the Noble and Slave Quarters, but who cannot be trusted to roam the city unsupervised. Noble families assign slaves to follow sash-bearers through restricted areas and report on their activities.
