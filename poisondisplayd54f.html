Description

Extracted from mushrooms that grow commonly in caves and forests, this toxin is occasionally used as a recreational drug despite its dangerous side effects. A creature that fails its initial saving throws sees displaced auras of color and light around other creatures and objects. The creature treats all targets as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls until the creature is cured or the poison has run its course.
