Description

This carved stone rod is capped with a flat metal trowel blade. The rod can be used three times per day, in any combination of the following abilities. <ul><li>The blade end can produce enough mortar each day to hold together a brick or stone wall 10 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, which takes approximately 8 hours of work (the rod does not create the other building materials, such as bricks or stones). The mortar fully cures after 8 hours. The blade produces mortar as needed as part of normal use (instead of all at once).</li><li>If a command word is spoken and the butt end is pointed at a piece of rock or stone weighing up to 1,000 pounds (approximately a 24-inch cube), the wielder can move that stone vertically as if using levitate, and can move the levitating stone horizontally 5 feet as a move action. Each such use of the rod lasts up to 10 minutes, and the wielder can divide this duration among multiple stones (but can move only one stone at a time).</li><li>If a second command word is spoken, the wielder can draw a line on the ground with the trowel blade, and over the course of the next 10 rounds, the line grows a wall of stone at a rate of 1 foot per round. The wall is masonry instead of natural stone. The wall grows to a maximum of 10 feet high and 10 feet long. It merges with existing masonry, or creates a smooth seam against natural stone or a wooden frame (such as a doorway). This ability functions only if the floor is stone (whether natural or worked).</li></ul>
