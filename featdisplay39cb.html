Indomitable Mountain Avalanche (Combat)

You are an impassable mountain, hurling your enemies back.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplayb1fc.html?ItemName=Indomitable%20Mountain%20Peak">Indomitable Mountain Peak</a>, <a href="featdisplay1952.html?ItemName=Indomitable%20Mountain%20Style">Indomitable Mountain Style</a>, base attack bonus +9.

Benefit: If an opponent fails at a combat maneuver against you, you can use an attack of opportunity to make a melee attack against the opponent using your highest attack bonus. If the attack hits, instead of dealing damage, you can push the opponent back 5 feet for every 5 by which it failed its combat maneuver check (minimum 5 feet). Additionally, when you hit with an unarmed melee attack against an opponent who provoked an attack of opportunity by failing its Acrobatics check to move through a space you threaten, you can push the opponent back 5 feet instead of dealing damage. The opponent moves back in a straight line, but stops before hitting any obstacle or hazard.
