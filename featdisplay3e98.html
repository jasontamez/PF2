You have removed yourself from your heritage so thoroughly that even magic does not recognize you.

Prerequisites: Exile's Path, <a href="featdisplayafb8.html?ItemName=Seen%20and%20Unseen">Seen and Unseen</a>, character level 11th, half-elf.

Benefit:  You are not considered elven or human for the purpose of harmful spells or effects based on your type, like a bane weapon or a ranger's favored enemy class feature.
