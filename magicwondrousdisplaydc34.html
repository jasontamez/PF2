Description

This squat glass jar contains a golden liquid that constantly swirls. This elixir causes the next potion or elixir that restores hit points that the imbiber consumes to be treated as if it were empowered. Increase all variable numeric effects of the potion or elixir by 50%. The effects of this elixir last for 5 minutes or until all of the imbiber's hit points are restored via an affected potion or elixir, whichever comes first.
