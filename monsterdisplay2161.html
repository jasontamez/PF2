Special Abilities

Aura of Courageous Inspiration (Su) An animate aria continually emanates a rousing song to bolster its allies (typically the construct's creator and any creatures designated as allies by the construct's creator). Allies within 90 feet of the animate aria that can hear its music receive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. As a standard action, the animate aria can increase these bonuses by 2 for 1 round. The aura of courageous inspiration is a mind-affecting effect-as a construct, the animate aria is immune to mind-affecting effects, and therefore does not receive the bonuses of its own aura. This ability is constant and cannot be suppressed by the animate aria.

Dissonance (Ex) As creatures of sound, animate arias are particularly vulnerable to sonic effects. A bard who succeeds at a DC 25 Perform check while using his countersong ability negates the animate aria's aura of courageous inspiration and natural invisibility abilities (making it appear as a humanoid-shaped cloud of prismatic color). In addition, an animate aria in the area of a silence spell or effect takes 2d6 points of damage each round.

Natural Invisibility (Ex) Although an animate aria remains invisible whenever this ability is not suppressed, even when attacking, its constant song allows other creatures to pinpoint its location. Any creature within 30 feet of the animate aria that can hear automatically identifies the squares containing the animate aria. Because an animate aria's invisibility is inherent, it is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.

Description

An animate aria is a piece of operatic music, either vocal or instrumental, magically solidified into a humanshaped form roughly 12 feet tall. A creature of sound, the animated music is invisible but emanates the inspiring work performed during the creature's musical creation.

Construction

An animate aria must be constructed in a ceremony involving a musical performance and a framework of silver chimes worth 2,000 gp, the latter of which is consumed in the shaping of the creature's form.
