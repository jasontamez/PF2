You recruit a professional groom to care for your mount.

Prerequisites: Character level 4th.

Benefit: This feat is similar to the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat, with several exceptions to note. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a groom) with this feat, and cannot recruit followers of his own. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat, but your groom is always at least 3 levels lower than your level.

A groom can take levels in <a href="classdisplayaec9.html?ItemName=Bard">bard</a>, <a href="classdisplay3651.html?ItemName=Fighter">fighter</a>, or <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger</a>. A groom can't multiclass, though he can take any archetype for which he qualifies.

A groom finds the best place to stable and conceal your mount and the mounts of up to five allies while you and your allies are elsewhere. A groom adds half his level (minimum 1) to Stealth checks when concealing himself and any mounts that are left in his care. A groom also gains the ability to speak with animals as a supernatural ability, but he can use this ability only with horses, riding dogs, and other mounts of the animal type.

If a groom gains enough XP to bring him to 2 levels lower than your level, he doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you advance, his XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.

If you release your groom from service or otherwise lose your groom, you can recruit a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat.
