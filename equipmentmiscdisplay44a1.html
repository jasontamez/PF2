Description

When you release this vial of alchemical particles into the water as a standard action, the particles immediately neutralize the scent of exposed blood within 20 feet, rendering the blood undetectable by scent (to a hunting shark, for example). Blood neutralizer has no effect on any blood that enters the area after the particles have been used. Blood neutralizer can be crafted with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) skill check.
