You can squeeze through small areas thanks to your slippery scales and lithe musculature.

Prerequisites: Serpentfolk.

Benefit:  You gain the compression universal monster ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 295), allowing you to move through an area as small as one-quarter your space without squeezing, or one-eighth your space when squeezing.
