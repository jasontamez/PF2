Description

This fine white powder is a powerful stimulant that affects the nervous systems of any creatures that inhale or ingest it, preventing them from sleeping for 24 hours. A packet of insomnia powder can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to avoid the effect, while those in the splash radius must succeed at DC 8 Fortitude saves. This is a poison effect.

Although it causes no severe damage, insomnia can cause a creature to be more prone to fatigue or exhaustion. Though it prevents sleep (and thus prevents wizards and some other spellcasters from regaining their spells), insomnia powder does not prevent a creature from meditating or praying. The effects of insomnia powder can be countered by sleep, neutralize poison, or similar effects.
