Description

This stuffed rag doll might resemble a child's toy if not for the vital
organs depicted on its cloth. By dabbing the doll with a few drops
of blood from a living creature (a standard action), the bearer
can form a sympathetic link between the doll and the victim.
If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the doll must beat the
target's spell resistance to create the link. As a standard action,
the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the
sickened condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative
energy damage plus 1 point for each die of the doll bearer's
sneak attack damage (if any). Each time the target is affected by
the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link. The doll's
holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight.
Once linked to a particular creature, an anatomy doll cannot
be linked to another creature, but the bearer can re-establish a
broken link by anointing it with more of the target's blood.
