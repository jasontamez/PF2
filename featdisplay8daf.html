Your painful stare inspires fear in your foes.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist level 9th, painful stare class feature.

Benefit:  When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will Save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become shaken for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become frightened, even if the target is already shaken.
