You surround a creature with glowing flames that outline it, as per faerie fire. If you use foxfire with positive energy, the flames don't give off heat. If you use it with fire, the flames still aren't hot enough to deal damage immediately, but the illuminated creature counts as being under the effects of severe heat and must succeed at a Fortitude save against nonlethal damage after 10 minutes. A creature can extinguish the foxfire automatically as a full-round action.
