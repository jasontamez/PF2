Description

A weapon of this type enables its wielder to determine the location, depth, kind, and number of aquatic predators within 680 feet. A trident of warning must be grasped and pointed in order for the character using it to gain such information, and scanning a hemisphere with a radius of 680 feet takes 1 round. The weapon is otherwise a +2 trident.
