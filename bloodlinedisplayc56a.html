Bloodline Arcana: When casting any spell that deals fire damage, you can instead heal your targets. The spell deals no damage, and living creatures affected by the spell instead regain a number of hit points equal to half the fire damage the spell would normally deal.

Bloodline Powers: The phoenix is an elemental creature of sky and primal fire, and its blood within you sings with a similar power.

The Unseen World (Su): At 1st level, you gain <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> and <a href="spelldisplay6868.html?ItemName=read%20magic">read magic</a> as spells known. At 5th level, the phoenix's blood drives you to find and save lost knowledge and magical items. As a swift action, you can automatically identify the properties of a non-cursed magic item you hold; you must still identify a cursed item as normal to correctly identify it as cursed. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per day.

Immolation (Su): At 3rd level, you gain the ability to surround yourself in fire as a swift action. This fire burns for a number of rounds per day equal to your character level plus your Charisma bonus. These rounds do not have to be consecutive. Any unarmed attacks you make while affected by immolation deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage, and any creature that ends its turn adjacent to you while you're affected by immolation also takes 1d6 points of fire damage.

Vermilion Wings (Su): At 9th level, you gain the ability to grow a pair of phoenix wings from your back as a standard action. The wings grant you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. You can dismiss the wings as a free action.

Restoring Flames (Sp): At 15th level, you can cast <a href="spelldisplay7255.html?ItemName=restoration,%20greater">greater restoration</a> once per day as a spell-like ability.

Rebirth (Su): At 20th level, the full power of a phoenix erupts from within you if you perish. When you die, you are brought back to life, as <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a>, after 1 minute. This ability can be used only once every 24 hours, and if you are slain again within this period, your death is permanent.
