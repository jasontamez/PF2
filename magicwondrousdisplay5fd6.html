Description

This intricate mechanism opens like a pocket watch to reveal a set of dials indicating the current phase of the moon, as well as the previous and upcoming phases. A moon clock can be destroyed as a standard action to release a powerful blast of lunar energy in a 30-foot-radius burst. Lycanthropes in the area of this blast must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or revert to their humanoid forms.
