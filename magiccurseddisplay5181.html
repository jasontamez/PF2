Description

The grip of this greatsword has a series of deep notches, and its jagged blade is a deep crimson. A bloodbite is awakened by bloodlust, and its appetite must be sated. When the wielder makes a successful attack with the bloodbite, it inflicts a wound that deals 1d4 points of bleed damage (in addition to its normal damage), but it also deals 1d4 points of bleed damage to the wielder as the hilt grows teeth that dig into the wielder's hands. Once used, the bloodbite must be used as its wielder's primary melee weapon, and it can be discarded only after the owner benefits from a remove curse spell or similar effect.
