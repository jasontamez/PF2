Description

This +3 <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">aberration-bane</a> <a href="magicweaponsdisplayfeb8.html?ItemName=Conserving">conserving</a> heavy crossbow is crafted with a darkwood body and embedded with brass, gold, and silver inlays. A creature struck by a bolt from this crossbow is affected by <a href="spelldisplay6e9f.html?ItemName=calm%20emotions">calm emotions</a> (Will DC 16). On a confirmed critical hit, the save DC for this effect increases by 4.

Up to three times per day as a swift action, the wielder can modify a loaded bolt into a brain-boring shot. These shots are not replenished by the conserving property of the weapon and are destroyed on impact or miss.

Brain-Boring Shot: The bolt is magically capped with a reinforced metal head. When the bolt hits, it automatically strikes somewhere near the target's brain (this attack has no effect against a target without a brain). The bolt head detaches and bores into the target's flesh, dealing an additional 6d6 points of damage before dissolving. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. If the target is affected by an ongoing mind-affecting effect, it can immediately attempt a new Will save to remove the effect. If the brain-boring shot was a confirmed critical hit, the target gains a +4 circumstance bonus on its Will save.
