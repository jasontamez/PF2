You can sense betrayal and intrigue as well as physical traps.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, rogue level 3rd, trap sense class feature.

Benefit: You gain a bonus on Perception checks to pierce another creature's disguise and Sense Motive checks to avoid being surprised by an attack. These bonuses are equal to the bonus you gain from trap sense.
