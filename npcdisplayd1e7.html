Boon A knight can vouch for a PC, the knight's sterling reputation enabling the character to avoid or lessen a punishment. The knight can also grant a character entry into a tourney or a meeting with his liege with a +5 bonus on one Diplomacy check.

Knights are noble warriors, proud of bearing and lineage and yet humble in service to their liege. Though merciful and generous of spirit, a true knight is always ready to level lance or bare steel in pursuit of justice and to protect the innocent. Knights may also serve as local lord-stewards, judges, or fortress commanders. Knights are usually found singly or accompanied by a squire, escorting a pair of pilgrims (CR 8), guarding two nobles (CR 11), or leading a lance of four cavalry (CR 10).
