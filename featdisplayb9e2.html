As a devotee of Pao-Lung philosophy, you constantly strive to learn from your mistakes and slowly but surely improve every aspect of yourself.

Prerequisites: Must be devoted to the philosophy of Pao- Lung and not worship any deities.

Benefit: Whenever you roll a natural 1 on an ability check, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check, or fail any of these checks by 5 or more, you may dedicate yourself to that specific type of check (such as a Will saving throw or a Swim skill check). For the next 24 hours, you gain a +1 bonus on checks of that type; the bonus increases by 1 every time you fail that type of check. If you succeed at your chosen type of check, the bonus immediately ends. Once you have designated a type of check to be affected by this feat, you cannot use the feat for another type of check for at least 24 hours.
