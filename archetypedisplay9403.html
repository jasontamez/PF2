Lifting Hand

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 23</a>
Those studied in the art of grappling know that using their opponents' own weight and momentum to lift, disable, or throw them is impressive and effective. When facing a master of the lifting hand, an enemy is likely to find itself sailing through the air or locked in a tortuous compliance hold.

Savage Toss (Ex): A lifting hand gains <a href="featdisplay3010.html?ItemName=Savage%20Slam">Savage Slam</a> as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites.

At 4th level, when the lifting hand succeeds at her grapple combat maneuver check while using the <a href="featdisplay3010.html?ItemName=Savage%20Slam">Savage Slam</a> feat and her grapple combat maneuver check result exceeds the opponent's CMD by at least 5, she can throw the opponent into an non-adjacent square. The lifting hand can throw the opponent 10 feet, plus an additional 5 feet for every 5 by which her grapple check exceeds the opponent's CMD. For instance, if the lifting monk exceeds the target's CMD by 15, she can throw the target into a square 20 feet away.

At 8th level, when using <a href="featdisplay3010.html?ItemName=Savage%20Slam">Savage Slam</a>, the lifting hand's target no longer receives a bonus to its CMD when the lifting hand attempts to throw it into a dangerous area.

This replaces stunning fist.

Bonus Feats (Ex): A lifting hand adds <a href="featdisplay2f36.html?ItemName=Whirling%20Hold">Whirling Hold</a> to her list of bonus feats at 1st level. At 6th level, she adds <a href="featdisplayb16f.html?ItemName=Dramatic%20Slam">Dramatic Slam</a> and <a href="featdisplaye6d6.html?ItemName=Overhead%20Flip">Overhead Flip</a>. At 10th level, she adds <a href="featdisplay6777.html?ItemName=Savage%20Leap">Savage Leap</a>.

This alters the monk's bonus feats.

Joint Lock (Ex): At 10th level, when a lifting hand succeeds at a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple, instead of choosing to damage, move, pin, or tie up the opponent, she can instead force one of the target's limbs into an agonizing position. The target becomes sickened as long as the lifting hand maintains the grapple. When the grapple is released or broken, the target is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to the lifting hand's level. This is a pain effect.

This replaces the bonus feat gained at 10th level.

Counter-Throw (Sp): At 12th level, a lifting hand can ready an action to trigger if a creature tries to attack her. When the readied action triggers, the lifting hand can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check with a +2 bonus. If she succeeds, she grapples the creature and negates the triggering attack, and she can spend an immediate action to use the <a href="featdisplay3010.html?ItemName=Savage%20Slam">Savage Slam</a> feat.

This replaces abundant step.
