Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This drab shirt helps its wearer blend in with the background even while accomplishing important things, the better to avoid any trouble that results. The wearer is visible, but easy to overlook, and observers explain away or forget her presence. An observer must succeed at a DC 11 Will save to notice the wearer; a success renders that observer immune to the shirt's effect for 24 hours. An observer automatically notices the wearer if the wearer attacks that observer or an ally of that observer.
