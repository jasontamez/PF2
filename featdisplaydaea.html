Some construct builders learn their art by creating poppets.

Prerequisites: Caster level 1st.

Benefit: You can craft poppets and add augmentations to existing poppets that you control. You are treated as having both Craft Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item for the purpose of fulfilling the prerequisites for Craft Construct.
