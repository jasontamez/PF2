Courtesans specialize in music and other pleasures. They often serve as information brokers and spies.

Siwar Kurash

Graceful, talented, and beautiful, Siwar provides the best companionship money can buy. Knowledgeable in topics ranging from art to politics, and highly schooled in etiquette, Siwar entertains lords and ladies every night, and her waiting list stretches months long.

Though seemingly compliant with clients, she compels other people through subtle influence, seeding her desires into clients and friends to ensure she is well fed, well clothed, and always entertained.

Though she has a reputation for maintaining clients' discretion, Siwar secretly trades information. Two criminal and political groups protect her and keep her indiscretions secret-and neither one realizes Siwar works for anyone else.

Combat Encounters: Not wishing to mar her beauty with wounds and scars, Siwar stays out of melee combat. Her charm and seemingly innocent nature can get her out of even the trickiest situations.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Siwar can be an informant in an urban area if PCs convince her to divulge what they need to know. She is attracted to influence, and tries to get close to the strongest fighter or most powerful wizard in a group of PCs. Siwar could instead find herself in conflict with PCs if they threaten her influence on local powers.
