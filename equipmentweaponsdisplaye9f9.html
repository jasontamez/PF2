Description

A quadrens looks similar to a sturdy dagger, but with four spikes mounted in a square pattern in place of a blade. When you score a critical hit with a quadrens, the resulting gaping wound causes 1 point of bleed damage. In addition to punching through hide and armor, the spikes can also be used to snag opponents' blades and twist them out of their grips.
