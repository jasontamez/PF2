While savagery is not inherently evil, some barbaric cultures thrive on depravity and welcome the act of feeding on their own kind. The raging cannibal is a barbarian who feasts upon her fallen opponents not out of hunger, or even a taste for flesh, but rather because she believes consuming her foes and defiling their lost lives demonstrates her strength. This penchant for feasting on the flesh of her kin makes the raging cannibal an awkward companion to travel with for many groups, with rumors revolving around the raging cannibal's culinary exploits often causing tense situations that other party members might be called upon to resolve via diplomacy before the raging cannibal grows frustrated and decides to take matters into her own hands!

Animal Fury:  At 2nd level, a raging cannibal must select animal fury as her first rage power.

This alters the barbarian's 2nd-level rage power.

Consume Vigor (Ex):  At 2nd level, when a raging cannibal reduces a creature of the same creature type as herself to 0 or fewer hit points with her bite attack during combat while raging, she can consume a chunk of its body to gain a portion of its power. If the creature's CR equals or exceeds her barbarian level, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage. She can never consume the same creature's vigor more than once. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the raging cannibal gains 1 additional round of rage each time she uses this ability.

This replaces uncanny dodge.

Intimidating Gouge (Ex):  At 3rd level, when a raging cannibal confirms a critical hit against a creature of the same creature type as herself with her bite attack while raging, she gains a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to half her barbarian level for the duration of the rage.

This replaces trap sense.

Feed from Fury (Ex):  At 5th level, a raging cannibal is empowered by eating her enemies during combat. When a raging cannibal confirms a critical hit against a creature of the same creature type as herself with her bite attack while raging, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to her barbarian level. These temporary hit points stack with other temporary hit points gained from this ability but not with those from other sources. These temporary hit points fade after a period of time equal to 10 minutes per barbarian level.

This replaces improved uncanny dodge.

Razor-Toothed Fury (Ex):  At 6th level, a raging cannibal's bite becomes even more fearsome. When using her bite attack, the raging cannibal can take a -1 penalty on her attack roll to add 2 points of bleed damage to the damage dealt. At 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the attack penalty increases by 1 and the bleed damage increases by 2 points.

This replaces damage reduction.

Rage Powers:  The following rage powers complement the raging cannibal archetype: internal fortitude, intimidating glare, primal scent, scent, and terrifying howl.
