Description

This incense comes in many
shapes and colors, but is otherwise
indistinguishable from nonmagical
incense until lit. When it is burned, the
special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense
are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 Spellcraft check.


When a divine spellcaster lights a block of incense of
meditation and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating
nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as
though affected by the Maximize Spell feat. However, all the
spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three
levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).


Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects
persist for 24 hours. The incense may be burned in a censer of
controlling air elements to summon a more powerful elemental;
this renders it useless for maximizing spellcasting.
