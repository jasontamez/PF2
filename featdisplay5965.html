If you jinx an already fascinated creature, it doesn't fully recover until the jinx ends.

Prerequisites: Bardic performance class feature, Halfling Jinx trait.

Benefit: If you jinx a creature under the effect of a bard's fascinate ability, it also takes a -10 penalty on initiative checks while affected by the jinx. A creature under the effect of your fascinate ability has a -2 penalty on its save against your jinx.
