Surprisingly quick and nimble for dwarves, fatal axes mix melee prowess with devastating throwing axe strikes to bring down their foes.

Thelan Stonebiter

In Thelan's mind, the task she performs serves the greater good of her clan and her fortress home. The dwarven people have many foes, from savage giants to sociopathic goblins to those capricious and deceptive elves. Her work, though unconventional, deceptive, and contrary to most dwarves' sense of honor and fair play, is essential in evening the odds. Not entirely without honor, she refuses to use her murderous art against fellow dwarves.

Combat Encounters: Though Thelan sometimes takes freelance assignments against non-dwarven targets, her true passion is protecting her people.

Roleplaying Suggestions: When not on a mission, Thelan acts like a normal dwarf. She is loyal to friends, her clan, and the thanes of her fortress. Few who know her suspect her of dark deeds.
