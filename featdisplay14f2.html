Your fighting technique makes you equally deadly with your firearm's stock as with its bullets.

Prerequisites: Pistol-whip gunslinger deed.

Benefit: When you perform the pistol-whip deed while using this style, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll and on the combat maneuver check to knock the target prone; this increases to +2 when you use a two-handed firearm. If you successfully knock the target prone, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from the target until the end of your next turn when you make ranged attacks with your firearm. You can treat one-handed firearms as light weapons for the purpose of abilities such as Weapon Finesse when performing the pistol-whip deed.
