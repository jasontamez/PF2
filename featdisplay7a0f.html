You are skilled at surrounding your enemies.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  When you are adjacent to an ally with this feat, the first time you melee attack an opponent, you can spend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step, even if you have otherwise moved this round.

Normal:  You can take a 5-foot step only if you have not otherwise moved in a round.

When you are adjacent to an ally that also has this feat, you can spend 2 stamina points to take a 5-foot step as a free action instead of an immediate action. You can still use this feat's ability only once per round.
