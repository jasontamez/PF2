Description

A barbed spear is a 10-foot-long polearm with a fourpronged head similar to a caltrop. The head is connected to the pole by a single weak bolt, giving the weapon the fragile condition. When you use a barbed spear to attack a creature that is prone, flying above you, or at least one size category larger than you, you can make a melee attack with a -4 penalty to jam the barbed head into the target's foot. If you're successful, the target takes 1 point of damage and the barbed head breaks off in the target's foot. The barb then acts as a caltrop, wounding the creature's foot and halving its speed. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is treated with a successful DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Like caltrops, barbed spears may not work against unusual opponents. A barbed spear that embeds its caltrop-like head into a target's foot gains the broken condition, and can't be used as a weapon until it's repaired.
