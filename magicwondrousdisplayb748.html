Description

When activated, this black pebble acts
as a limited gravitational singularity.
Once the command word is spoken, the
pebble delays for 1 round, then pulls all
stone or earth within a 5-foot-diameter
sphere toward it with irresistible force.
This causes small tunnels to collapse inward, creating localized
cave-ins. Imploding stones do not affect living creatures, though
any creature in the same square as an activated imploding
stone is caught in the bury zone of the collapse (Core Rulebook
415). Imploding stones are destroyed when used. Activating an
imploding stone is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks
of opportunity.
