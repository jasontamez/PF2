Quiet Death - Feats







Quiet Death (Combat)

You have learned to dispatch your enemies with the silence and grace of an accomplished assassin.

Prerequisites: Dex 19, Stealth 10 ranks, rogue level 10th.

Benefit: When you ambush an enemy or enemies that are unaware of your presence, you can roll a Stealth check with a -5 penalty. The result indicates the Perception DC to hear your attacks (rather than the normal DC of -10 to hear pitched combat) until an opponent's first action, when the DC returns to -10. Other enemies present can still see the attack; Quiet Death only prevents the sounds of battle from alerting further enemies.
