Description

These gloves are covered in fish scales and always feel cold and wet to the touch. While wearing these gauntlets, after a 24-hour attunement period, the wearer can throw a weapon that deals piercing damage underwater without penalty, using the weapon's normal range increment. When the wielder attacks a target in water from land, regardless of the weapon the wielder is using, the target doesn't benefit from cover or total cover for being in water.
