Your raised shield protects you as you charge forward.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, base attack bonus +6 or fighter level 4th.

Benefit: When performing a bull rush or overrun combat maneuver as part of a charge, you don't provoke an attack of opportunity for that maneuver. If you already have the improved Bull Rush or Improved Overrun feats, you gain an additional +2 bonus on your combat maneuver check when attempting the respective maneuver.

Special: This feat counts as having a Strength score of 13 and Power Attack for the purposes of meeting the prerequisites of Improved Bull Rush and Improved Overrun, and for feats that require either of those two feats as prerequisites.
