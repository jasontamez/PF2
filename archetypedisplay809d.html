While most occultists learn to draw power from a variety of implements and objects, esoteric initiates have focused their study entirely on items of antiquity connected to the teachings of the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye, believing such items to be more powerful than mundane items.

Implements of the Palatine Eye (Su): An esoteric initiate has formed a supernatural bond with a set of the order's writings collected into a book. If the book is damaged, it is restored to full hit points when the initiate's mental focus refreshes. If the book is lost or destroyed, the initiate can replace it with another similar one, but doing so requires an 8-hour ritual that binds the new book to him.

The book serves as an implement for any two schools of magic at 1st level. The initiate gains new implement schools normally. However, the initiate's additional implements must be masterwork or magic items worth at least 50 gp, and they must directly or nominally represent the Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye's beliefs or history. For example, the initiate's implements could be Osirian antiques, trinkets covered in Palatine iconography, or the like. When the initiate benefits from his implements' resonant powers, he treats his occultist level as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the powers' benefits only.

An esoteric initiate can't save generic mental focus inside his own body instead of investing all of it. At 4th level, when the initiate gains the ability to shift his mental focus from one implement to another, he loses no focus when doing so.

This alters mental focus, implements, and shift focus.

Symbolism (Sp): At 5th level, an initiate who spends 1 minute carefully studying any written work can understand its gist even if he doesn't speak the language in which the text is written. A number of times per day equal to the initiate's occultist level, the initiate can cast comprehend languages as a spell-like ability to read a written work, using his occultist level as his caster level. If he uses symbolism to read a portion of the work that contains a hidden message or a cypher, he is automatically granted a Linguistics check with a bonus equal to his occultist level to decipher the message.

This replaces aura sight.
