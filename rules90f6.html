Next, adjust the creature's derived statistics, such as its initiative, AC, saving throws, melee and ranged attack bonuses, BAB, CMB, and CMD. Adjust any special attacks or qualities that are based on the creature's size, Hit Dice, or ability scores. If the creature changed in size, be sure to adjust its AC, attack, CMB, and CMD accordingly (as noted on <a href="rules1ab0.html?Name=Step%204:%20Skills%20and%20Feats&amp;Category=Adding%20Racial%20Hit%20Dice">Table 2-3</a>). Table 2-1 also tracks the average change to the creature's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls. Add up these values for each step of change between the creature's original and new CR. If the creature changed size, make sure to make changes to its natural armor bonus, as noted on <a href="rulesd662.html?Name=Step%202:%20Add%20Hit%20Dice&amp;Category=Adding%20Racial%20Hit%20Dice">Table 2-2</a>. If the creature does not meet these averages, you should consider adjusting its ability scores or Hit Dice to get it closer to the target.
