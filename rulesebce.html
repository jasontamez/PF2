The first step in calling extraplanar assistance is to determine the method of bringing the outsider to the Material Plane. If the caster is a cleric, the spell of choice is <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a>; wizard, sorcerers, and summoners rely primarily on <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a> (or <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a>, which controls without requiring binding). However, none of these necessarily bind the outsider to the caster's needs, and a wise spellcaster augments the summoning with additional encouragement, usually in the form of gifts or bargains.

Clerics and oracles find the job of summoning and binding outsiders much easier than arcane spellcasters do. A cleric calls upon her deity to send a like-minded creature by way of one of the <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a> spells. That outsider is in the service of the god, and its desires almost always align with the cleric's goals, or at least run in parallel with them.

The cleric must bargain with the deity's servant for a payment agreed upon before the outsider will perform the task: gold, magic items, gifts, sacrifices, or promises by the cleric to achieve certain goals particular to the conjured ally. The greater the task, the greater the payment required, with a minimum of 100 gp worth of goods or services, sometimes extending into the thousands-and sometimes the ally simply refuses the cleric's binding if the job is too dangerous or beneath its dignity.

The arcane method for binding outsiders is more difficult. First, a binder must create a trap, a <a href="spelldisplay876d.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20evil">magic circle</a> focused inward. Typically the circle is outlined in a substance that is anathema to the outsider he wishes to summon. He must protect this circle against any sort of disruption, for even the smallest variation in its energies opens the circle and allows the escape of the creature he has summoned. It is for this reason that most binders' lairs are in high towers or deep dungeons, far from wind or pests.

When an arcane caster speaks the words of the <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a> spell, the outsider can resist via a Will saving throw, with no aid from its spell resistance. If it fails the save, the <a href="spelldisplay876d.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20evil">magic circle</a> draws it inexorably into the trap. Once there, the outsider can pit its spell resistance as a check against the caster's level, attempt to flee via dimensional travel, or attempt to overcome the spell by imposing its spiritual presence with a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier). Succeeding at any of these checks breaks the binding, and a fortunate binder suffers no additional harm from such a breach; the annoyed outsider just leaves. This is not always the case, however.

Some outsiders lash out at their failed binders. Because of this, many binders take additional precautions: a second <a href="spelldisplay876d.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20evil">magic circle</a> in which they can stand, and <a href="spelldisplaybbc0.html?ItemName=dimensional%20anchor">dimensional anchor</a> cast within the <a href="spelldisplay876d.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20evil">magic circle</a> to prevent the conjured outsider from fleeing instantly. A tremendously powerful wizard or sorcerer might even use <a href="spelldisplay30a6.html?ItemName=trap%20the%20soul">trap the soul</a> on his victim, forcing it into a prepared vessel until it agrees to the binder's strictures.

Smart arcane binders often make deals with the creatures they call. Like clerics using <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a>, they bargain and shower the outsider with gifts in exchange for their services. While it is always good for an arcane spellcaster to make these deals from a position of strength, it is much better to get the outsider to come to mutually agreed upon terms for the service, rather than forcing it to commit actions against its nature or desires.
