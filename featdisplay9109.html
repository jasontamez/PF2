Your pursuit of dispassionate perfection gives you unmatched insight into the condition of others.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb423.html?ItemName=Alertness">Alertness</a>, Perception 5 ranks.

Benefit:  You can perform the read aura occult skill unlock even if you can't use psychic magic. If you can cast psychic spells or have the Psychic Sensitivity feat, you can use read aura one additional time per day.

Once per day, you can perform an aura reading as a full-round action. If you successfully use detect thoughts or a similar mind-reading divination on a creature, you can use the read aura skill unlock on that creature as a full-round action as long as it is in your line of sight and within 30 feet. If you fail the check, you can't attempt to read that same creature's aura for 24 hours.

Special:  If you have a ki pool, you can expend 1 point from your ki pool as a swift action to gain one additional daily use of the read aura occult skill unlock.
