Description

These sturdy goggles have a mirror sheen on the outside of their
lenses, a wrapping of leather holding them snugly in place. This
tint blocks a considerable amount of natural light. Twice per day,
the goggles' wearer can emit bright light on command to a range
of 30 feet. Any creature within that area must succeed at a DC 13
Fortitude saving throw or be blinded for 1 hour. In addition, the
wearer also gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against
visual effects.
