When formulating a mystery adventure, a GM needs to account for the realities of a fantasy world-primarily magic. While some crimes and criminals might prove vulnerable to the right spells, true masterminds will know about such magics and expend resources to stymie investigations relying upon them. GMs should also be familiar with the effects of common divination spells, as well as what spells might confound them.

Detect Thoughts: <a href="spelldisplaycca9.html?ItemName=Detect%20thoughts">Detect thoughts</a> is a useful spell when questioning witnesses. The GM should not place the criminal among the witnesses if the PCs are likely to use <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a>. However, witnesses will likely have opinions and dark thoughts that may seem suspicious and send the investigators in the wrong direction-making most realize the imprecision of the spell in group settings.

Discern Lies: By uncovering lies, the PCs can focus their investigations on what is being concealed-usually, the truth about the crime. There are other reasons that people lie, though. A suspect or witness might lie for a number of reasons, such as shame over what she was doing, fear of retribution, or to protect someone else. And a suspect can always deny lying and refuse to say anything more.

Divination: PCs can use the <a href="spelldisplaya551.html?ItemName=divination">divination</a> spell to try to solve the mystery. The GM need not answer their question plainly, however. In addition, multiple <a href="spelldisplay818c.html?ItemName=divinations">divinations</a> about the same topic reveal the same advice, so unless the PCs follow the advice and learn what they can from that course of action, they cannot learn more by asking different questions about the crime.

Detect Alignment: Just because an NPC has an evil alignment doesn't mean he's a mystery's architect or even a villain. In common society, there are untold numbers of petty evils, but the crimes of a petty cheat probably have nothing to do with a greater plot. Thus, <a href="spelldisplayb63d.html?ItemName=detect%20alignment">detect alignment</a> can't be relied upon as the perfect villain detector. However, one of the surest ways to convince a group of a character's guilt is to have <a href="spelldisplayb63d.html?ItemName=detect%20alignment">detect alignment</a> fail when he's scrutinized. A clever villain with <a href="spelldisplayefea.html?ItemName=undetectable%20alignment">undetectable alignment</a> could obscure the alignment of one or several innocents, throwing a hurtle in the way of magic-reliant investigators.

Modify Memory: Witnesses, suspects, and even criminals might not recall pertinent information if their minds have been tampered with. The GM should not use the spell too frequently, however. As with other clue-negating spells, the PCs should learn something from the fact that they learned nothing. At the very least, they might suspect compulsion magic-and thus the involvement of a spellcaster.

Speak with Dead: <a href="spelldisplay10c2.html?ItemName=Speak%20with%20dead">Speak with dead</a> allows the characters to speak with a corpse, but the corpse knows only what it did in life. If the victim was attacked from behind, he may not have seen his murderer. <a href="spelldisplay10c2.html?ItemName=Speak%20with%20dead">Speak with dead</a> also fails if the corpse has been a target of the spell within the past week, or if the corpse doesn't have a mouth. Be sure to give the PCs some clue for their efforts, however.
