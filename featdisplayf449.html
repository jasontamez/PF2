You have been trained to fight dragons.


Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, base attack
bonus +4.

Benefit:  Whenever you confirm a critical hit against
an opponent that has a breath weapon, you can forgo the
extra critical damage to instead prevent your foe from
using its breath weapon for a number of rounds equal to
twice the critical multiplier of your attack, in addition
to any normal delay mentioned in the breath weapon
effect's description.
