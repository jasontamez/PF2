When working in tandem, you can make it difficult for foes to use their magical abilities.

Benefit:  When you and at least one ally with this feat threaten the same enemy, the enemy treats the DC to cast spells defensively as 2 higher for each threatening character with this feat. If you or your allies are incapable of taking an attack of opportunity against the target for any reason, the effects of this feat do not apply.
