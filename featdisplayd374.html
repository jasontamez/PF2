Your habitual stillness makes you difficult to perceive for creatures that use blindsight or blindsense.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Stealth)</a>, Stealth 5 ranks.

Benefit:  You may use the Stealth skill to hide from any creature attempting to perceive you using blindsight or blindsense, even if you are clearly in that creature's perceptual field. This feat does not confer any advantages against other forms of perception, such as scent, vision, or tremorsense.
