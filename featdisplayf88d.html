Your arcane prowess is so great that even cursed items fail to befuddle you.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 5 ranks, ability to cast detect magic as a spell or spell-like ability.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on checks made to identify the properties of magic items. In addition, you need only exceed the DC of these checks by 5 in order to determine whether or not an item is cursed.

Normal:  Unless the check made to identify a cursed item exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the item's curse cannot be detected.
