You relentlessly push your enemies around, as the sea moves those within and upon it against their will.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplay3380.html?ItemName=Improved%20Drag">Improved Drag</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Reposition">Improved Reposition</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit: When you successfully drag or reposition an opponent while using this style, at any point during the dragging or repositioning of the opponent, you can move 5 feet as an immediate action, including moving into a square previously occupied by the opponent, even if you have already taken a move action this round. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
