If she spends 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the arcanist can predict the weather in her current location for the next 24 hours. The arcanist's prediction is always accurate, but it cannot account for spells or supernatural effects that might alter conditions. In addition, she gains a bonus equal to half her arcanist level on Fortitude saves against severe weather for the next 24 hours. She can share this benefit with a number of allies equal to her Charisma bonus.
