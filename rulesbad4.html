You can keep yourself and others fed and safe in the wilderness. Use the following DCs for certain tasks.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Task</td><td>Survival DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Get along in the wild</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>Endure severe weather</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Keep from getting lost</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Predict the weather up to 24 hours in advance</td><td>15</td></tr> </table>

When you get along in the wild, you can move up to half your overland speed while hunting and foraging without needing food and water supplies. You can provide food and water for one other character for every 2 points by which your check exceeds 10.

When you endure severe weather, you gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving at up to half your overland speed, or a +4 bonus if you remain stationary. You can grant this bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which your check exceeds 15.

When you predict the weather, you can predict the weather for one additional day in advance for every 5 points by which your check exceeds 15.

Action: Varies. A single check could represent activity over the course of hours or a full day.

Try Again: You can attempt a Survival check only once every 24 hours to get along in the wild or endure severe weather. You can attempt a check to avoid getting lost or avoid natural hazards for each situation that calls for one, but you can't retry a check to avoid getting lost in a specific situation or to avoid a specific natural hazard.
