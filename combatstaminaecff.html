When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt to reposition the target anyway. If you do, reroll the confirmation roll and use it to determine if the reposition attempt exceeds the opponent's CMD. This reroll is used only for the reposition combat maneuver; it can't cause the critical hit to be confirmed. You still can't make the attempt if the target is immune to critical hits.
