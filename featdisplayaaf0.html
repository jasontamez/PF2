Brackish Spell (Metamagic)

You can conjure a seawater orb to protect yourself.

Benefit: This feat can be applied only to spells with the water descriptor. You can modify the spell to surround you with a thin sheath of brackish salt water in addition to the spell's normal effect. You gain DR/piercing equal to the spell's level for 1 round after you finish casting the spell. After this round, the water collapses into a briny puddle and the effect ends. A brackish spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.
