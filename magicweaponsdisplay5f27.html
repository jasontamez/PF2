Description

This +1 keen lance has the ability to penetrate and destroy shields. Whenever its wielder uses it to successfully strike an opponent who carries a shield, the opponent's shield takes the same damage as the opponent. If the wielder uses the lance to make a sunder attack against a shield, it bypasses the shield's hardness.
