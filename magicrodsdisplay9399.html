Description

This 3-foot-long iron rod has a flanged, conical head and strikes as a +1 light mace. On command when held in hand, the rod points in the direction of the closest grave, tomb, or cairn within 500 feet. If the wielder concentrates on a specific type or subtype of creature, the rod identifies only gravesites that hold the remains of that type of creature. The rod can search for the remains of a specific individual if the wielder carries an item that the individual owned in life.
