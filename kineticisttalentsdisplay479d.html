Saving Throw Fortitude negates
Creatures that take piercing or slashing damage from your blast are infected with spores. If a target fails its Fortitude save, it takes 1d6 points of damage per round for 10 rounds as plants and fungi grow out of its body. At the end of that time, the target is exposed to the pulsing puffs disease. This infusion is a disease effect. When using a wood kinetic blast against a creature infected by this infusion, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, to saving throw DCs, and on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance.

Pulsing Puffs: Blast-injury; save Fort DC 18; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saving throws.
