Sibusiswe Njai

Sibusiswe is a fierce and feral elf with the grace of a panther, and claims that she communes with animistic spirits of the forest and savannah. A loner, she prowls the wildlands, appearing and disappearing like a flash of lightning.

Combat Encounters: Sibusiswe follows the dictates of the animalistic spirits that she believes guide her. Because of this, her attacks can be unprovoked-as much as a surprise to her as to her victims.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Sibusiswe's spirits are capricious, but also inquisitive. An encounter with the elf is just as likely to end in a parley as it is to end in combat.
