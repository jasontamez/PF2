You can slip under a foe trying to grab you, knocking him off balance.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay25a7.html?ItemName=Agile%20Maneuvers">Agile Maneuvers</a>, Small size or smaller.

Benefit:  If an opponent larger than you attempts to grapple you and fails, you may make a trip attack as an immediate action against that opponent with a +2 bonus. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
