These creatures are the result of magical draconic experiments at crossbreeding wyverns and kobolds. Wyvarans are fiercely territorial creatures loyal to their kin and tribe, and allow no interlopers into their lands without good reason or proper tribute. Each defends its personal property, and seeks revenge on any who dare steal from it. Most evil and neutral wyvarans primarily concern themselves with expanding their territory and wealth.

Many civilized races dismiss wyvarans as fast, dumb, selfish brutes. However, a creature who respects the wyvarans' rules about their property finds that they make steadfast and loyal allies. Adventuring wyvarans often view their companions as clutchmates, and are willing to take great risks to protect them.

Evasive Maneuvers

Coastal wyvarans often take to the air to defend their territory from intruding ships, and are forced to learn aerial maneuvers to avoid siege fire. They fly with an average maneuverability instead of clumsy, and they gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saving throws against siege weapons. This racial trait replaces darkvision and slapping tail.


Replaces Flight

Memories of the Forgotten

Generations of wyvaran elders pass down tales that predate written history. While many ignore these or dismiss them as simple stories, others revere the lore of their elders. These wyvarans consider it their sacred duty to study the lost histories and pass them down to others. They gain a +2 racial bonus on two Knowledge skills of their choice. Those Knowledge skills are class skills for them. This racial trait replaces flight.


Vestigal Wings

When resources are particularly scarce, some young wyvarans develop smaller-than-average wings incapable of flight. However, these wings are perfectly suited for other acrobatic maneuvers. These wyvarans gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks, and one of these is a class skill for them. In addition, they can ignore the first 20 feet of falling damage when they make a successful Acrobatics check. This racial trait replaces flight.



Replaces Languages

Neglected Heritage

Because of their dwindling population and cultural stagnation, some wyvarans have given up on their people, favoring a life among other races instead. These wyvarans lose Draconic as a starting language, but gain a +1 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks when making requests and gathering information. They can't take Draconic as a bonus language, but can learn it normally with Linguistics. This ability alters the wyvaran's languages.



Replaces Slapping Tail

Greed
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nfl?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-Dragons">Legacy of Dragons pg. 18</a>
Most wyvarans crave treasure, but for some, amassing wealth is a compulsion. Wyvarans with this trait gain a +2 on racial bonus on Appraise checks, and Appraise is a class skill for them. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Sleight of Hand checks when attempting to take items from other creatures. They can also use their tails to attempt these Sleight of Hand checks. This racial trait replaces slapping tail.
