Most commonly, nightmares come not from an outside source, but solely from the dreamer's mind. Whenever a creature sleeps, if it experienced any of the following events since the last time it slept, there is a 20% chance it has a naturally occurring nightmare: being reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, being frightened or panicked, being shaken for more than 1 minute, or taking 1 or more points of Wisdom damage or drain. If a campaign uses the <a href="rules0b4f.html?Name=Sanity&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">sanity rules</a>, taking sanity damage also counts.

A naturally occurring nightmare takes the form of a <a href="rules7d42.html?Name=Dimension%20of%20Dreams&amp;Category=Esoteric%20Planes">frightening dream</a>. As with other dreams, the nightmare dreamscape has the flowing time, highly morphic, and wild magic planar traits. The exact nature of a naturally occurring nightmare dreamscape is created from the dreamer's unconscious thoughts, and is not under its control. The GM can select the <a href="rules0d4b.html?Name=Planar%20Traits&amp;Category=Planar">dreamscape's traits</a>, or determine them randomly using the following tables. It is more difficult for the dreamer to attempt fantastic feats in nightmares, and the DC of Charisma checks to do so increases by 10.
