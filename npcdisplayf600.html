Special Abilities

Danger Sense (Ex) The shieldmarshal gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 his shieldmarshal level, and can always act during a surprise round, even if unaware of opponents.

Eye for Detail (Ex) The shieldmarshal adds his Intelligence bonus as well as his Wisdom bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks. Additionally, he gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his shieldmarshal level on Perception checks opposed by another creature's Disguise or Sleight of Hand checks.

Gunmarshal (Ex) The shieldmarshal adds 1/2 his shieldmarshal level to his gunslinger level for the purpose of gaining deeds. Within the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, the shieldmarshal gains a bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks equal to 1/2 his shieldmarshal level if he openly displays his shieldmarshal's badge.

Labyrinthine Cunning (Ex) The shieldmarshal never becomes lost in urban terrain, and he never takes penalties to movement for poor visibility in urban terrain, even while temporarily blinded. A shieldmarshal can open or close doors as a swift action instead of a move action.

Legal Judgment (Ex) The shieldmarshal can pronounce legal judgment upon his foes as a swift action, providing a bonus or ability based on the type of judgment made. This functions as an inquisitor's judgment class feature and allows the shieldmarshal to use the legal judgment abilities on page 63.

Shieldmarshals uphold the law in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar. Chief among their duties is preserving the secrets behind Alkenstar's most advanced weapons. Their badges, an emblem of crossed rif les, grant them the authority to enter nearly any building in Alkenstar in the course of their investigations.
