Deities: Pharasma.

Gentle Rest (minor): At 1st level, you can fill a living creature with lethargy by hitting it with a melee touch attack, causing it to become staggered for 1 round. If the target is already staggered, it falls asleep for 1 round instead. An undead creature that's touched is staggered for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).

Back to the Grave (major): At 10th level, when using channel energy to heal living creatures, you can take a swift action on that same turn to also deal damage to undead creatures (as your channel energy ability). Undead take an amount of damage equal to half the amount healed, and can attempt the normal saving throw to halve this damage.
