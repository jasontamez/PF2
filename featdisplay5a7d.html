You've built off of some of the closely-guarded secrets of the undine steamcasters, allowing you to use fire magic underwater easily.

Benefit: You can apply Steam Spell only to a spell with the fire descriptor. A steam spell works underwater without a caster level check, but it requires a caster level check to function above water. A steam spell uses up a slot the same spell level as the spell's actual level.
