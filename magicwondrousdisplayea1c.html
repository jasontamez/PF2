Description

This jagged bone knife seems too thin and frail for combat
but easily cuts flesh. If used to perform a coup de grace on a
helpless living creature and the creature dies from the attack,
the creature's flesh begins to peel off and its bones animate as
a skeleton under the command of the bearer of the razor. The
creature's flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate.
The bearer of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the
flesh to the animate skeleton, which ends the necromantic
magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse of a
person killed or mutilated by knife wounds). If the bearer uses
the razor to flense and animate another creature's bones, the
previous animate skeleton is immediately destroyed.
