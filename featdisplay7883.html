You've gained enough control over your body to translate strength into swiftness.

Prerequisites: Con 13 or Wis 13, Enhanced Morale, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: Whenever an effect would grant you an enhancement or morale bonus to your Strength score (such as via bull's strength or a skald's inspired rage performance), you can instead apply that bonus to your Dexterity score. You make this choice when you first gain the bonus. The bonus type does not change.
