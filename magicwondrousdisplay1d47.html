Description

This small bronze token is shaped like a heavy shield. Emblazoned clearly on the token is an image of a snake eating its own tail encircling seven eggs-the holy symbol of Mazludeh, the Mother of Hearth and Wall (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Shores 23 for more information about this deity). Once per day, the wielder of this item can touch the token as a standard action. When she does so, she chooses an ally within 30 feet whom she can see. The wielder and her ally then both gain either a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls or a +2 deflection bonus to AC for the next 10 rounds (chosen when the wielder touches the token; once a benefit is chosen, it can't be changed during the effect's duration). The wielder can dismiss this benefit early as a free action, but the item's use is still expended as normal.
