When making an attack using a ranged weapon while mounted, you can spend 1 or 2 stamina points to reduce the penalties on the attack roll by double the number of stamina points you spent.

Mythic Mounted Archery

Your skill as a rider allows you to take cover and shoot with amazing accuracy.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya64f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Archery">Mounted Archery.</a>

Benefit:  When using the Ride skill to use your mount as cover, you can still make a single ranged weapon attack as a standard action. While your mount is moving, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate the penalties for making ranged weapon attacks while mounted until the beginning of your next turn.
