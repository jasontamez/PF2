You realize that sometimes it's a safer
bet to simply get out of danger's way
as fast as possible. You are able to
summon a surge of adrenaline when
you grab what is most dear to you
and run.


Prerequisites: Str 13, Acrobatics
1 rank.

Benefit:  Whenever you withdraw as
a full-round action and have at least one
free hand, you can pick up one unattended
object or unconscious ally of your size or
smaller at any point during your movement without
provoking attacks of opportunity. Any additional
movement performed on your turn still provokes attacks
of opportunity as normal.

In addition, you treat your Strength score as 2 higher
for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity.
