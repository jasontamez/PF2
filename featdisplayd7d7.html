You are able to cast a 1st-level spell as a spell-like ability.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast 4th-level spells.

Benefit:  Choose one 1st-level spell that you know. You may cast that spell twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spell.
