Description

This M1914 concussion grenade (see
page 66) can be thrown up to 680 feet
away, as it teleports itself directly to
the target location when thrown. This
allows a dimensional grenade to be
thrown even at targets behind cover,
including total cover. The wielder does
not need to attempt an attack roll; the
dimensional grenade simply appears in the target location
and detonates at the beginning the wielder's next turn.
A dimensional grenade deals 3d6 points of force damage
in a 15-foot radius (Reflex DC 15 for half). In addition, any
creature damaged by the grenade's blast must succeed at
a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. The grenade is
consumed in the attack.
