Description

This foot-long tube of gold absorbs nearby sound when
struck, as if it were the target of a silence spell. This ability
can be used once per day. The chime vibrates silently for
the next 5 rounds, increasing in strength as time passes.
On the bearer's turn each round there is a cumulative
20% chance that the chime prematurely ends the magical
silence and releases the pent-up sound as a shout spell as
a free action, oriented in a random direction. The bearer
may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime
again, ending its silence early and unleashing the shout in
a direction of his choosing. If dropped while vibrating, the
chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases
the shout effect in a random direction. A broken chime of
resounding silence cannot be used until it is repaired. The
chime has no effect if struck in an area of silence it did not
create.
