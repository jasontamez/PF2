If a monster needs more attacks than the array allows, calculate the damage yourself. Start by combining the damage values in the monster's array: a monster that deals 20 points of damage with two natural attacks should deal 40 points of damage total. If the monster has a large number of secondary attacks (which are less likely to hit), increase the total damage value by 25% or 50%. Finally, divide the total among all attacks before using the table. You don't have to distribute it evenly if some attacks should deal less damage.

If you want to increase both the number of attacks and damage output, use the extra attack option instead.
