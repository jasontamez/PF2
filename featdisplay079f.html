You can deliver a breathtaking bardic performance while activating the powers of a magical instrument, or utilize your bardic prowess to enhance the instrument's power.

Prerequisites: Bardic Performance class feature, Perform (any instrument) 3 ranks.

Benefit: When activating a magical instrument as a fullround or standard action, you may begin a bardic performance as a free action. Your performance must use a Perform skill appropriate to the instrument.

Alternatively, you may expand 2 rounds of bardic performance to add +2 to any save DCs associated with the use of the instrument's powers.

If your instrument summons allies, such as pipes of the sewers or the horn of Valhalla, your bardic performances with that instrument affect those allies even if they normally would not.
