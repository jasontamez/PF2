Your music is infused with your faith.

Prerequisites: Bardic performance, good alignment, worshiper of a good deity.

Benefit:  When using bardic performance, you may choose to play, recite, or sing a religious song or piece of scripture of your faith. Each round of bardic performance you spend in this way, you count as presenting a holy symbol, chanting prayers, or ringing a hand bell for the purpose of keeping vampires at bay.
