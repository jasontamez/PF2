Not all arcanists peer inward to discern the deepest secrets of magic. Some look outward, connecting with extraplanar creatures and bartering for secrets, power, and favor.

Planar Spells:  An occultist adds all <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a> spells to her spell list (using her arcanist level as the cleric level), and treats <a href="spelldisplaydf57.html?ItemName=plane%20shift">plane shift</a> as a 5th-level arcanist spell.

Conjurer's Focus (Sp):  An occultist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to cast <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster I</a>. She can cast this spell as a standard action and the summoned creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of <a href="spelldisplay7fcb.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%209">summon monster IX</a> at 17th level), at the cost of an additional point from her arcane spell reserve per spell level. An occultist cannot have more than one <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a> spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a> immediately ends. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.

Planar Contact (Sp):  At 7th level, an occultist can cast <a href="spelldisplaybb99.html?ItemName=augury">augury</a> once per day and <a href="spelldisplay54f1.html?ItemName=contact%20other%20plane">contact other plane</a> once per week, using her arcanist level as her caster level. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 7th level.

Perfect Summoner:  At 20th level, an occultist can use her conjurer's focus without spending points from her arcane reservoir, and the creatures summoned last until dismissed. This ability replaces magical supremacy.
