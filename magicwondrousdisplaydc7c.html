Description

These masterwork iron manacles sap
the will of their wearer. When they are
attached to a humanoid creature as
their command word is spoken, they
affect their prisoner with a dominate
person spell, except that if the prisoner
fails its saving throw, the effect lasts for
as long as the shackles are attached. Removing or destroying
the shackles immediately breaks the enchantment. The
shackles can be so used once per day. Shackles of durance
vile can only be activated against a helpless, restrained, or
willing creature; if attached to a creature still able to resist they
function only as manacles, albeit superior ones. Shackles of
durance vile have hardness 15, 20 hit points, and a superior
lock. They have a break DC of 30 and an Escape Artist DC of 35.
