Boon A sage can translate any foreign language for PCs or make up to five skill checks (including identifying magic items) for PCs. A sage can also craft magic items at a 10% discount.

A sage is an academic of the first order. Both a polyglot and polymath, a sage can be consulted to answer any number of questions by anyone wealthy enough to afford her considerable fees. A sage is often accompanied by a merchant prince who procures all the research materials she desires (CR 12), and together they may sit on the small council of a queen (CR 13) or king (CR 15).
