Description

These weapons are treated sticks of wood, either left bare or covered in elaborate decorative designs. Baston fighting sticks vary in length from 2 to 4 feet, with thicknesses varying between 1 to 3 inches. In most applications, these weapons are similar to clubs or quarterstaffs, but in the hands of a trained expert, they truly shine. A creature with the Combat Reflexes feat treats the weapon as having the blocking and performance weapon special features (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22).
