Description

This curio is a four-leaf clover that was harvested from the wild and preserved. Typically encased in glass or crystal, four-leaf clovers are sometimes pressed, bronzed, or protected through other means. A creature with a four-leaf clover in her possession can call upon an extra boost of luck before attempting a single ability check, saving throw, or skill check. She gains a +2 luck bonus on that check. This ability functions three times per day, and requires a free action that the owner can perform even when it's not her turn.
