Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This elixir is generally stored in a palm-sized crystal jar. When applied under the eyes as a standard action, it reveals the magical nature of illusions and some creatures. For 1 hour after applying the ointment, whenever the user first perceives an illusion, she can attempt a Will save to disbelieve it even without interacting with it. An Ulfen user recognizes fey animals and creatures that have changed their shape into human or animal forms as more than they appear, though she does not learn their true nature.
