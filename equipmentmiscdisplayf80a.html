Description

A treasure chest is a common wooden chest treated with resin to make the wood water-resistant. Metal bands, usually bronze to prevent rusting, are strapped around the treasure chest for extra reinforcement, and the lock is also typically made of bronze. A treasure chest uses the statistics of an ordinary wooden chest (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 62), but its hit points increase by 25% and its break DC increases by 2. Treasure chests are waterproof and withstand being buried better than ordinary chests
