Description

Weapons with the toxic special ability reinforce the effects of applied poisons. The save DC of a poison applied to the weapon and delivered via an attack increases by 2. In addition, each time such a weapon strikes a target, there is a 25% chance that the poison dose is not expended in the attack and can be used to make an additional attack. A single dose of poison can be preserved by this property only once.
