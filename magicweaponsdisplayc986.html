Description

This brass-colored +1 double-barreled pistol has a dark oaken grip and ornate musical motifs etched into the entire surface. Three times per day, when the wielder fires a loudshot pistol at a creature within 20 feet, she can command the pistol to emit a sonic boom at the creature, permanently deafening it if it fails a DC 13 Fortitude save. If the wielder fires both barrels of this pistol in the same round she commands it to deafen a creature, the DC of the Fortitude save increases to 15. If the wielder is a gunslinger with the pistolwhip deed, she can also command a loudshot pistol to deafen the creature she is pistol-whipping. This counts toward the total number of times per day she can use this ability with the pistol.
