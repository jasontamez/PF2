Advanced Versatile Performances - Bard/Skald









Advanced Versatile Performances


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast</a>
The charismatic kitsune have developed countless techniques for transforming even the most mundane tasks into stunning and riveting performances. These much-lauded arts have spread like wildfire with bards who perform across Golarion. Beginning at 6th level, instead of selecting an additional skill with versatile performance, a bard or skald can choose an advanced versatile performance for one Perform skill he previously selected with versatile performance. Some advanced versatile performance options can be selected only if the bard or skald meets the option's prerequisites. A bard or skald with an archetype that replaces versatile performance cannot select advanced versatile performance options.
