Dragonblood Shifter

Dragonblood shifters draw upon the inherent strength and majesty of the true dragons, gaining a measure of their powers from their association.

Draconic Aspect (Su): A dragonblood shifter can temporarily imbue her body with draconic majesty as a swift action. When activating this ability, the shifter must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types from the table below. Her draconic aspect abilities grant resistances and deal a type of damage based on the chosen dragon type. While shifted into this form, she gains the <a href="umr6bd3.html?ItemName=Scent">scent</a> ability and energy resistance 5 against the energy type that corresponds to her selected dragon type. She can maintain this form for a number of minutes per day equal to 3 + her shifter level. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The shifter can select a different dragon type every time she uses this ability, but she must end her current draconic aspect and activate this ability again in order to change her chosen dragon type.

At 5th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter's draconic aspect increases to 10. At 10th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter's draconic aspect increases to 15, and she gains a <a href="umr9469.html?ItemName=Breath%20Weapon">breath weapon</a> of her energy type that deals 1d6 points of damage per shifter level within a 30-foot cone. A target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the dragonblood shifter's level + her Charisma modifier) to reduce damage by half. The dragonblood shifter can use her breath weapon once per day.

At 15th level, the energy resistance granted by the dragonblood shifter's draconic aspect increases to 20, and she can use her breath weapon twice per day.

At 20th level, the dragonblood shifter becomes immune to the energy type that corresponds to her selected dragon type while in her draconic aspect. In addition, she gains spell resistance equal to 10 + her shifter level, and she can use her breath weapon three times per day.

This replaces shifter aspect and all improvements to shifter aspect.

Wyrmshifter (Su): At 9th level, a dragonblood shifter can push her form closer to that of a true dragon. She gains a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against sleep and paralysis effects. She does not gain the wild shape ability until 9th level. When using the ability, she takes on the form of a true dragon; this ability functions as <a href="spelldisplaya1e7.html?ItemName=form%20of%20the%20dragon%20I">form of the dragon I</a> instead of <a href="spelldisplayecf3.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20II">beast shape II</a>. A dragonblood shifter can use wild shape for a number of minutes each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each minute of wild shape counts as a use.

This alters wild shape and replaces chimeric aspect.

Improved Wyrmshifter (Su): At 14th level, a dragonblood shifter's ties to her draconic abilities grow stronger. Her bonus on saves against sleep and paralysis effects increases to +4. Her wild shape ability now functions as <a href="spelldisplay630b.html?ItemName=form%20of%20the%20dragon%20II">form of the dragon II</a>, and she can use it for a number of minutes each day equal to twice her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier, though it still must be used in 1-minute increments.

This replaces greater chimeric aspect.

Greater Wyrmshifter (Su): At 20th level, a dragonblood shifter's tie to her draconic abilities reaches its peak. She becomes immune to sleep and paralysis effects. She can use wild shape to transform into a dragon for a number of hours each day equal to her shifter level + her Wisdom modifier. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments. For abilities that function based on uses of wild shape, each hour of wild shape counts as a use.

This replaces final aspect.



Alternate Natural Attacks

A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter's claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter's claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter's claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter's natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.

Dragon (Dragonblood Shifter Archetype): Bite (B, P, S), tail slap (B), wing (B).
