While many warpriests focus on threats to the body, the disenchanter focuses on dangers to the mind and the soul. Using the power of his patron, the disenchanter seeks to keep the powers of magic in check.

Bonus Feats (Ex):  Whenever a disenchanter gains a bonus feat, he must choose from the following list: Great Fortitude, Improved Counterspell, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Skill Focus (Spellcraft), or Spell Focus (abjuration). At 6th level, he adds the following feats to this list: Dispel Synergy, Improved Great Fortitude, Improved Iron Will, and Improved Lightning Reflexes. At 12th level, he adds the following feats to this list: Destructive Dispel, Dispelling Critical, Parry Spell, and Ray Shield. He need not meet the prerequisites for these feats. This ability alters bonus feats.

Mystic Interference (Su):  At 4th level, a disenchanter can channel a burst of pure abjuration magic to grant protection to himself and all allies with 30 feet. Affected creatures receive a +1 bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities for a number of rounds equal to his warpriest level. This is a sacred bonus if the warpriest is good-aligned or able to spontaneously cast cure spells, and a profane bonus if the warpriest is evil-aligned or able to spontaneously cast inflict spells. Using this ability consumes two uses of his fervor ability. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the bonus granted by mystic interference increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). This ability replaces channel energy.

Banish Enchantment (Su):  At 6th level, a disenchanter learns to focus his mystic interference. As a standard action, he can consume two uses of his fervor ability to target a single creature within 30 feet with a targeted dispel magic. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 6th level.
