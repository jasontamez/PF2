Description

This squat, golden idol looks like a bald, obese wise man with an extra eye in his forehead. It can be used once per day to gain information as with an augury spell, and once per day as a divination spell. Once per week, a single yes-or-no question can be asked of it (as with a commune spell). The answers do not come from a deity, but instead from insights granted by celestial movements and conjunctions; a sample insight might be, "Because Aballon and Eox are in conjunction in the House of the Eagle, the answer is yes."
