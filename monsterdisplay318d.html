Special Abilities

Adamantine Bite (Ex) A forgefiend's bite
attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes
of overcoming damage reduction.


Rend Armor (Ex) When a forgefiend hits with a bite
attack, it chews any armor worn by the target-this
grants the forgefiend a free sunder attempt against
armor worn by the target if the victim fails a DC 22
Reflex save. A forgefiend also gains Greater Sunder
and Improved Sunder as bonus feats. The save DC
is Strength-based.


Searing Spew (Su) A forgefiend can belch forth a
searing pile of slag from its body maw as a standard action
once every 1d4 rounds. This blob of molten metal affects any
10-foot-square area adjacent to the forgefiend. Any creature
in this area takes 14d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 22
halves). The slag quickly cools, forming a rugged pile of
worthless scrap and misshapen metal that is treated as difficult
terrain-this stuff crumbles to powder in 1 hour. The save DC is
Constitution-based.


Description

Scanderigs, more commonly known as "forgefiends,"
look like large, heavily armored, barrel-shaped giants,
with enormous mouths in their bellies in addition to the
normal-sized ones in their heads. They are native to the
Plane of Earth, but sometimes make their way through
subterranean portals onto the Material Plane, where
they gorge themselves on rich and relatively uncontested
mineral veins. A forgefiend might live quite happily
inside a mountain's heart for centuries, only causing
trouble when the ore runs out or interlopers attempt to
mine its territory.


Forgefiends are particularly feared in many dwarven
societies. In addition to their penchant for destroying
deep forges, they are often portrayed as boogeymanlike
figures for frightening dwarven children and
instilling good smithing habits-for it is said, "For
every scrap of slag you waste, a scanderig is making
haste. Those who use excessive ore find forgefiends
scratching at their door!"
