Vishkanya Favored Class Options

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, Vishkanyas have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.

The following options are available to all Vishkanyas who have the listed favored class.

Bard (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 208</a>): Add +1 to the bard's total number of bardic performance rounds per day.
