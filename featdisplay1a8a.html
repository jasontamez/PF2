You and your allies have trained together long enough
to know how to exploit an opponent's disadvantage to
make her predicament even worse.


Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay9292.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirty%20Trick">Improved Dirty Trick</a>, <a href="featdisplay73fd.html?ItemName=Underhanded%20Teamwork">Underhanded Teamwork</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  Whenever an ally who also has this feat
performs the dirty trick combat maneuver against a foe
that you both threaten, you may attempt a dirty trick
combat maneuver against the same foe as an immediate
action to inflict a second condition. If the foe uses an
action to remove the first condition, it also removes the
condition imposed by your immediate action.
