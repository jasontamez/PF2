You can forgo a critical hit in order to pass it on to an ally.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, worshiper of Desna.

Benefit:  When you confirm a critical hit against a creature, you can choose to forgo the effect of the critical hit and grant a critical hit to the next ally who hits that creature with a melee attack before the start of your next turn. Your attack only deals normal damage, and the next ally to hit the target automatically confirms the attack as a critical hit.

When you confirm a critical hit, you can spend 10 stamina points to use Butterfly's Sting without forgoing your own critical hit.
