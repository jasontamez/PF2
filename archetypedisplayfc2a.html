Tracker

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 189</a>
Some companions are expert trackers, able to use their scent ability to follow any trail.

Keen Nose: A tracker must be an animal companion with the scent ability.

Tracker Skills: Trackers treat Survival as a class skill.

Expert Tracker (Ex): A tracker gains a competence bonus on Survival checks to track via scent equal to half its total Hit Dice. At 6th level, it can move at its normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. It takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20 penalty) when moving at up to twice its normal speed while tracking.

This replaces share spells and devotion.
