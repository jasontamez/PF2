Description

Wing sheaths are protective coverings created from thick fabric or canvas. The sheaths are designed to tightly cover a pair of wings to keep them hidden beneath a cloak or loose-fitting clothing. Noticing hidden wings bound within wing sheaths requires a successful DC 20 Perception check. Donning or removing wing sheaths requires 1 minute, or a full-round action with assistance. Wing sheaths can be burst with a successful DC 22 Strength check.
