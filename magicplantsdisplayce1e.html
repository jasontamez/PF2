Description

This tall tree has no branches but sprouts expansive leaves at the top. Its large, spiny fruit can be split to provide a meal for four that emulates heroes' feast. If a single creature consumes the entire fruit, it gains the benefits of heroes' feast for a full 24 hours and heals twice as many hit points of damage.

A palm of decadent feasts provides only a single fruit per year, which ripens on the summer solstice.
