These bracers look like normal protective wear. They empower
the wearer to use any bow (not including crossbows) as if she

any type of bow, she gains a +2 competence bonus on attack
rolls and a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls whenever
using that type of bow. Both bracers must be worn for the
magic to be effective.
