Description

This elixir turns its imbiber fiery red, making it easier to pass as an efreeti. Unscrupulous efreet can sell fireskin elixir to guests who have been barred from citizen-only districts and must rely on disguises. Fireskin is highly addictive. Many once-savvy merchants have fallen into destitution as they scrambled to maintain efreet favor and secure a steady supply of the drug. This item can be crafted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
