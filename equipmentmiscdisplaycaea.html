Description

These prosthetics are used as a replacement for lost or missing teeth. False teeth fashioned from wood or animal teeth are more common, while masterwork varieties are sculpted from bone or porcelain. Clockwork false teeth are novelties with mechanisms allowing the teeth to clatter and move on their own. Winding the clockworks is a move action, and the teeth move forward over flat surfaces at a rate of 5 feet per round for 10 rounds after one winding.
