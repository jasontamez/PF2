Ancient catfolk legends claim their kind was created to protect the world from the sinister forces that exist at the world's fringes. Many catfolk bloodragers capable of communing with the ancient spirits of creation take on the burden of this ancient tradition.

Bloodline: A prowler at world's end must choose the destined bloodline as his bloodline.

Spirit: At 1st level, a prowler at world's end gains the ability to channel the spirits of creation, granting him the <a href="classdisplay0c62.html?ItemName=Medium">medium's spirit and spirit surge abilities</a>. A prowler channels the cheetah (which acts as the trickster), the leopard (which acts as the guardian), the lion (which acts as the marshal), and the tiger (which acts as the champion). The prowler does not have access to the archmage or hierophant legends. The favored locations for these spirits are altars, churches, sacred groves, and shrines, and their taboo requires the prowler to strongly revere nature and attempt to either destroy or incapacitate evil wherever he encounters it.

A prowler at world's end gains his spirit's lesser power at 1st level, its intermediate power at 8th level, and its greater power at 16th level. A prowler's spirit surge bonus never advances beyond 1d6.

This ability replaces the 1st-, 8th-, and 16th-level bloodline powers.

Bloodline Powers : At 4th level, a prowler at world's end gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 1st level. At 9th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 4th level. At 12th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 8th level. At 15th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 12th level. At 20th level, he gains the bloodline power normally granted by his bloodline at 16th level.

This ability alters the 4th-, 16th-, and 20th-level bloodline powers and replaces the 9th-level and 15th-level bloodline feats.

Chosen of the Spirits (Su) : At 11th level, whenever a prowler at world's end enters a bloodrage, he can apply the effects of <a href="spelldisplaye2c7.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20IV">beast shape IV</a> to himself instead of using greater bloodrage or mighty bloodrage to apply the effects of a bloodrager spell to himself. He must assume the form of a great cat of the same kind as a channeled spirit (cheetah, leopard, lion, or tiger). This effect lasts for as long as the prowler continues bloodraging, regardless of its normal duration, and using it does not consume a spell slot.

This ability alters the bloodrager's greater bloodrage and mighty bloodrage.

Shapeshifted Spellcasting (Su) : At 12th level, the prowler at world's end can cast spells while under the effects of chosen of the spirits. This ability functions as <a href="featdisplaybba2.html?ItemName=Natural%20Spell">Natural Spell</a>, except the prowler uses the ability to cast while under the effects of chosen of the spirits instead of wild shape.

This ability replaces the 12th-level bloodline feat.
