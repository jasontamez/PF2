Ghalshoaton - Monsters







Ghalshoaton

This creature's head supports a massive crocodile jaw, surrounded by  the  wide  hood  of  a  king  cobra.  Its  hands  are  giant  toothy scorpion pincers and its segmented tail ends in a barbed scorpion stinger. Countless glittering scales cover most of its ten-foot-tall muscled form, and the rest of it is protected by a dull insectoid carapace. Its eyes are like firelight glinting on gemstones, blazing with the intensity of the desert sun.

Special Abilities

Master of the Curse (Su) Ghalshoaton were cursing mortals before the spell bestow curse was ever invented. The DC for the ghalshoaton's curses include a +2 racial bonus. The curse ends if the ghalshoaton dies. Most ghalshoatons have a favorite curse they prefer to use; this enables them to identify their brethren's handiwork.

Poison (Ex) A ghalshoaton's tail is poisonous (injury or contact, fortitude dC 23, initial damage 1d6 str, secondary damage 2d6 str). As a move action it may project its poison at a single target within 20 feet with a successful ranged touch attack.

Premonition (Su) A ghalshoaton can visit the dreams of his enemies and insert disturbing visions of their grisly demise at the devil's hands. if the dreamer fails a DC 20 Will save, the ghalshoaton automatically confirms critical threats against the target for the next 24 hours. It can invade dreams once per day. This ability does not work on creatures that do not sleep, do not dream, or are immune to mind-affecting effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Ringing Words (Su) When a ghalshoaton speaks to a mortal using its telepathy, the devils final words linger, reverberating in the mortal's head for 2d6 hours (save DC 20). This effect gives the creature a -4 penalty to saving throws against the devil's bestow curse spell-like ability. This often unnerves the mortal during their next encounter with the ghalshoaton. The save DC is Charisma-based.

River of Life (Su) Due to its ancient bond with the deserts of osirion, a ghalshoaton reacts to water from osirion's river sphinx as though it were holy water or acid. A direct hit with a vial of river sphinx water deals 2d4 points of damage to the devil. A vial smashed within 5 feet of it deals 1 point of splash damage. Weapons wet with the river's water bypass the devil's damage reduction, and its fast healing cannot heal wounds from these weapons. If submerged in the great river, a ghalshoaton is irrevocably destroyed in 1 round, losing half its hit points on its first turn after immersion and dying 1 round after the immersion takes place.

Summon Devil (Sp) Once per day a ghalshoaton can attempt to summon an erinyes or a bezekira with a 50% chance of success. The erinyes always appears as a young osirian female while the bezekira takes the form of an semitransparent large-sized crocodile. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Wall of Sand (Su) Five times per day, a ghalshoaton may create a dense wall of compacted desert sand. Treat this wall as a wall of stone (CL 12th).

Description

Ghalshoaton are devils usually associated with deserts and the land of Osirion. Known for their cruelty, physical power, and hideous curses, they are also incredibly intelligent and devious. History mentions several evil pharaohs with ghalshoaton  minions, and these shapechanging devils also appear in many folktales from ancient Osirion. They enjoy bartering for mortal souls and murdering innocent folk that get in their way.
