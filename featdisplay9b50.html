You can charge your kinetic blast with disruptive elemental energy that tears apart elemental spells.

Prerequisites: Two basic blast wild talents from two different elements, expanded element class feature, kinetic blast class feature.

Benefit: You can use a readied kinetic blast to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level, provided that the target spell has any of the following descriptors: air, cold, darkness, earth, electricity, fire, force, light, or water.

Normal: A readied kinetic blast can be used to counterspell spells that share its descriptor.
