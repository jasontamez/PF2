Description

From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend from this weapon like points on a compass rose. By gripping the crossbar that runs through the weapon's open middle, a wielder can strike with it as a deadly melee weapon. Alternatively, by gripping it by the outer rim, a starknife's light, aerodynamic design allows it to be thrown short distances in a manner similar to a chakram.
