Description

The nine-section whip consists of steel bars linked together. The final bar is a 6-inch weighted spike. This weapon can be wielded as a single-handed weapon, a two-handed weapon, or in pairs. Nine-section whips often have colored cloth flags attached to the ends to make them easier to control.
