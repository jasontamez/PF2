Haughty avengers often serve as diplomats and bodyguards.

Nyalil Stormstrike

Nyalil sees herself as a full elf, not a half-breed. She so thoroughly rejects her human side that she treats humans as lesser creatures-but can be so charming that humans often love her anyway.

Combat Encounters: Nyalil is often in the company of elven knights, wizards, and priests, who only halfway accept her.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Nyalil is both charming and arrogant, and her words are often a stream of veiled insultsand clever quips, especially when she's dealing with humans.
