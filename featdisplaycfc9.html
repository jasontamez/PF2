You have been lashed by the power of the storm so many times that you retain a powerful affinity for it, able to draw upon your reserves of energy to strike enemies with living lightning.

Prerequisites: Shambling mound, must have been struck by lightning.

Benefit: As a free action, you may charge one of your limbs with electricity equivalent to a shocking grasp spell, dealing 5d6 electricity damage to a creature you touch, attack with an unarmed strike, or grapple. If making a touch attack, you get a +3 to your attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. Each time you use this ability, you take 1 point of temporary Constitution damage; you regain these lost Constitution points at a rate of 1 per hour. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your hit dice.
