Description

A wizard hook is a +1 hook hand (Pirates of the Inner Sea 19) and a useful item for any arcane spellcaster. Although a wizard hook does not allow for fine manipulation, it is infused with magic that bolsters somatic components-you can use a hand stump outfitted with a wizard hook to fulfill any somatic components for casting arcane spells. A wizard hook also grants proficiency in its use as a weapon. You can make touch attacks with spells using a wizard hook, either by making a normal attack with the hook (in which case it deals normal hook hand damage plus the spell effect), or by making a touch attack with the hook (in which case you gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll and the save DC of the spell increases by +1, but you do not do hook hand damage).
