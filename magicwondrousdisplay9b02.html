Description

This triangular amulet of gold and lapis lazuli depicts a stylized eye-the symbol of the Ancient Osirian deity Horus, god of rulership, the sky, and the sun. Priests of Horus fashioned the first eye of Horus amulets centuries ago to protect members of their order, particularly from minions of the god Set. Now, the occasional eye of Horus amulet turns up in a marketplace or in the hands of nomadic traders or adventurers.

An eye of Horus amulet grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. In addition, once per day, the wearer can surround herself with an aura of shimmering sunlight that protects her as dispel evil. Using this effect to drive an evil extraplanar creature back to its home plane or to end either an evil spell or an enchantment spell cast by an evil creature cancels this effect.

Lastly, if the wearer of an eye of Horus amulet is targeted by an effect that causes blindness, she can, as an immediate action, cause the amulet to absorb the effect. The wearer suffers no harm from the effect, but the amulet cracks in half, rendering it forever useless thereafter.
