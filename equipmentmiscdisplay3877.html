Description

A crutch is a simple device composed of wood or metal and held under the arm to assist the injured or impaired with walking. Using a crutch requires a free hand, but does not impede movement speed for an experienced user. A Medium crutch can be wielded as a simple one-handed melee weapon that deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage.
