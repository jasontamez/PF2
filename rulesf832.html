Master architects across the Inner Sea region and beyond use the following building materials to protect against thieves and spies as well as invaders.

Dead-Magic Wall: Dead-magic walls incorporate cold iron runes that negate all magic passing through, as described in the spell <a href="spelldisplay8db6.html?ItemName=antimagic%20field">antimagic field</a>. If a room is enclosed on all sides (including the ceiling and floor) by dead-magic walls, the area within functions as an antimagic field. Creating a dead-magic wall requires the spell antimagic field, the expenditure of 3,000 gp for each 5-foot-wide-by-10-foot-tall section of wall, and the creator to have the <a href="featdisplay7f69.html?ItemName=Craft%20Wondrous%20Item">Craft Wondrous Item</a> feat.

Lead-Lined Walls: Lead-lined walls block nearly all divinations from passing through, but are ineffective as long as any door is open so much as a crack. Detection and location magic generally is blocked as long as there is an unbroken lead barrier directly between the caster and the protected creature or object, but scrying effects, <a href="spelldisplay5dd5.html?ItemName=discern%20location">discern location</a>, and other spells that aren't limited to straight lines of effect are blocked only if the protected creature or object is seamlessly enclosed by lead-lined walls. Because of this and the fact that they are rumored to cause insanity in anyone who dwells within long enough, these walls are rarely used in any structures other than vaults and panic rooms. The price includes adding lead lining to any doors, shutters, and other openings into the room so that the lead seal is complete when they are closed. A room sealed fast against divination from all directions by lead is also airtight, potentially suffocating anyone trapped inside. A lead-lined wall costs an extra 250 gp for each 5-foot-wideby- 10-foot-tall section of wall. This augmentation cannot be applied to paper walls.

Secrecy Runes: Magically reinforced walls can incorporate secrecy runes to prevent magic from allowing someone to see within. Sounds cannot pass out of an area enclosed by secrecy runes on all sides (including ceilings and floors), as long as all exits are closed. In addition, the runes block divinations of or below a specified spell level (as indicated on the table below) from entering an area enclosed by secrecy runes on all sides (including ceilings and floors), even while portals to the area are open. See the table below for prices and the maximum level of spells each type of runes can block. Creating secrecy runes requires the <a href="featdisplay7f69.html?ItemName=Craft%20Wondrous%20Item">Craft Wondrous Item</a> feat, the spell <a href="spelldisplayd4a6.html?ItemName=mage's%20private%20sanctum">mage's private sanctum</a>, and the expenditure of the listed amount of gold for each 5-foot-by-10-foot section of wall.
