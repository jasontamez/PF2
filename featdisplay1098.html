You have intertwined your familiarities with pesh and magic to unlock strange powers.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (any)</a>, ability to cast 2nd-level spells.

Benefit:  When you consume pesh, you take 1 fewer point of Constitution or Wisdom damage (your choice). In addition, you add spells from the sahir-afiyun spells listed below to your own class spell list or list of spells known. You can add one spell from the highest level you can cast; you can instead add two spells to your list of spells known, but both of these spells must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast for that class. If you have more than one spellcasting class, choose one and add the sahir-afiyun spell or spells listed below to that class's spell list or list of spells known.

1st-alleviate addiction (see page 19), lesser confusion, night blindness (see page 19), pesh vigor (see page 19), ray of sickening, remove fear, sleep.
2nd-augury, calm emotions, euphoric cloud.
3rd-contact high (see page 19), deep slumber, imbue with addiction (see page 19).
4th-absorbing inhalation, confusion, divination.
5th-symbol of sleep.

All sahir-afiyun spells require 1 dose of pesh as a material component, either replacing the existing material component, or as part of the material component if the existing component costs more.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, add one or more sahir-afiyun spells to your spell list.
