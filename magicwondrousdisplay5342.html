Description

This simple yet elegant silver headband mentally warns the wearer before she commits a social misstep, which includes any action that would increase the DCs of Diplomacy checks to alter the attitudes of those around her or worsen the attitude of a person that the wearer considers very important. This effect functions similarly to that of a phylactery of faithfulness, except no contemplation is required; the headband simply alerts the wearer of the consequences before she can perform the action.
