Energies from the Plane of Air ease your movements and let you make mighty leaps.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can wrap your body in airy energies. This reduces your effective weight by half. While this ability is active, you gain a circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks equal to half your ranks in Knowledge (planes), you are always treated as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump, and your Acrobatics checks to high jump are treated as long jumps for the purpose of determining the DC.

You can use this feat's benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.
