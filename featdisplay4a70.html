The collectors of the lost dead prefer to use complex theology or blunt warnings to gather wayward spirits, but sometimes a more direct approach is necessary. One of them shared a trade secret with you.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast <a href="spelldisplay53a8.html?ItemName=disrupt%20undead">disrupt undead</a>, character level 3rd, <a href="racesdisplay41f7.html?ItemName=Duskwalker">duskwalker</a>.

Benefit: The damage dealt by your <a href="spelldisplay53a8.html?ItemName=disrupt%20undead">disrupt undead</a> spell increases by 1d6. It increases by an additional 1d6 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 7d6 at 18th level).
