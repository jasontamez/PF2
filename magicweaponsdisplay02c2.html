Description

This +2 arrow is fitted with a head of pure, crystallized blightburn. Unless contained in a lead-lined case or quiver, the arrow deals 1 point of fire damage per round to the creature carrying it. If the arrow hits, the arrowhead embeds itself in the target, dealing an additional 3d6 points of fire damage. The arrow continues to deal 2d6 points of fire damage each round for the following 6 rounds unless it's pulled out as a move action. A creature taking recurring damage from a blightburn arrow also suffers from low-level blightburn radiation as long as the arrow remains embedded. An arrow that misses its target can be recovered as normal, but an arrow removed after hitting a target is destroyed.
