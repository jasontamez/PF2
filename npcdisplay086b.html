Singing odes of battle and bravery, these chroniclers make sure the living never forget those traditions, and even try to encourage the living to surpass the great deeds of the heroes of past ages. They believe battle is the truest test of a person's mettle.

Ygulda Goldenbrow

At a young age, Ygulda fell in love with ancient ballads and odes, and now she considers herself a living valkyrie. She aids any warriors she believes carry the true spark of heroism, hoping they will serve as muses for future songs in which she can immortalize their great deeds.

Combat Encounters: Ygulda travels with a cadre of heroic warriors, mostly barbarians. She tells them that it's better to die a glorious death in battle than to survive through cowardice.

Roleplaying Suggestions: A hard fighter and a hard drinker, Ygulda believes that victory should be met with celebration. She scorns anyone she considers a coward.
