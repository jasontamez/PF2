Type curse; Save Will DC 19
Effect The victim is hunted by a <a href="monsterdisplay0d5e.html?ItemName=Bogeyman">bogeyman</a>. Once per day, the victim must attempt a Will save against the curse. If he succeeds, he takes a cumulative -1 penalty on future saving throws against the curse. If he fails, a bogeyman is called within 1 mile and begins stalking him over the course of 2d12 hours, attempting to kill him when he appears to be most vulnerable. When combat begins with the bogeyman, the victim automatically becomes shaken for 1 minute. The curse revives the slain bogeyman to hunt the victim again the next time he fails the saving throw against this curse.
Cure Only a <a href="spelldisplay6497.html?ItemName=limited%20wish">limited wish</a>, <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a>, or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> can free the hunted.
