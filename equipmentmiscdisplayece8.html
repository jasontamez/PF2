Description

This padded cloth jacket is often worn alone or with mail or plate armor and is favored by hunters, guards, and soldiers. A gambeson fitted with leather loops to more easily attach armor is called an arming doublet. Although sufficient to protect you against casual scrapes, it is not as thick as padded armor.
