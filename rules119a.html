The subject of designing spells is touched on only briefly in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. While some guidance on cost and time is provided, a GM needs to consider balance and design factors before allowing a PC to introduce a new spell into the game. As a first step, request a detailed write-up of the spell using the Pathfinder RPG rules. Based on this write-up, you can determine whether or not the spell is balanced for its level and appropriate for the game.

Spell Categories: When considering a new spell, first determine the category into which it fits. Spells can be divided into the broad categories of offensive magic (spells that deal direct damage, enhance combat abilities, or summon allies to fight), defensive magic (spells that protect the caster or her allies, control or impede enemies, or heal damage), and utility magic (spells of general use outside of combat, such as travel magic and most divinations). Some spells fit into multiple categories, such as <a href="spelldisplaya488.html?ItemName=teleport">teleport</a>, with both defensive and utility applications.

Level-Appropriate: Compare the new spell to other spells in the same category and at or near the desired spell level. Pay close attention to "must have" choices like <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>, <a href="spelldisplay0446.html?ItemName=dimension%20door">dimension door</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay5dac.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20force">wall of force</a>. If the spell is more powerful or more useful than other spells of the desired level, increase the level. If it seems weak, consider lowering the level. If there is already a similar spell in the game, pay particularly close attention to the new spell's relative power.

Saving Throw or Attack Roll: Most spells that are usable against others should require either a saving throw or an attack roll (generally touch or ranged touch). Spells that are quite powerful for their level, like <a href="spelldisplay2b8a.html?ItemName=disintegrate">disintegrate</a> or <a href="spelldisplaya376.html?ItemName=phantasmal%20killer">phantasmal killer</a>, may require both, or allow two saving throws. Watch out for spells that effectively take the target out of the fight and are negated by a saving throw. Consider adding a minor effect even on a successful save, and toning down the result of a failed save. Spells that automatically affect the target should be higher level or limited in their consequences.

Components: Unless there's a particularly good reason, almost all spells should require both verbal and somatic components, and most divine spells should require a divine focus. Spells with no verbal component are particularly rare. If the spell-as-designed lacks them, consider adding material component or focus requirements as a means of adding flavor. Expensive components and foci are a good way to adjust the effective power of a spell without changing the level.

The best spells do something interesting even when the casting isn't fully successful. They should have fairly simple mechanics without many ambiguities, special cases, or qualifications. If a spell takes a half-page or more to describe, it is probably too complicated and should be rejected or revised.

Watch out for spells that counter or otherwise render useless equal- or higher-level magics. For defensive spells, countering an equal-level spell is fine (like <a href="spelldisplay01c1.html?ItemName=shield">shield</a> negating <a href="spelldisplay2658.html?ItemName=magic%20missile">magic missile</a>), but an offensive spell generally should only overcome lower-level defenses or higher-level spells that duplicate those defenses (like <a href="spelldisplay2b8a.html?ItemName=disintegrate">disintegrate</a> destroying both <a href="spelldisplay5dac.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20force">wall of force</a> and <a href="spelldisplay92c4.html?ItemName=forcecage">forcecage</a>).

Good spells expand upon the existing themes of magic, but in a novel manner. The game doesn't really need more ways to throw damage around, but a spell that hurls adjacent enemies away from the caster is both interesting and useful. Watch for spells that break the implied limits of the game. Most arcane casters have poor healing abilities, and divine spells rarely excel at direct damage. With rare exception, spells shouldn't duplicate existing class features or feats.

While as a general rule overly specialized spells are a bad idea, there's much to be said for researching specialized spells like a brewer's blessing or a charm to hold a shoe on a horse. If a player is particularly excited about the spell, consider approving it even if it doesn't have much in-game application.

Successfully researching a new spell requires time and expensive research. An optional system for researching new spells is outlined below. The research should cost at least 1,000 gp per spell level (or even more for particularly exotic spells) and require both the Spellcraft skill and a Knowledge skill appropriate to the researcher's class. Wizards and bards use Knowledge (arcana), sorcerers use a Knowledge skill appropriate to their heritage (usually arcana, nature, or planes), druids and rangers use the Knowledge (nature) skill, and clerics and paladins use Knowledge (religion). The actual research process varies by the type of spell, often involving magical experimentation, the purchase and study of moldy scrolls and grimoires, contact with powerful magical beings or outsiders, and extensive meditation or rituals.

For each week of research, the caster makes separate Knowledge and Spellcraft checks against a DC of 20 plus twice the level of the spell being researched, modified according to Table 5-1. To successfully research the spell, the caster must succeed at both checks. Failure indicates the week was wasted. Spells of 4th-6th level requires 2 weeks of successful research, while spells of 7th-9th level require 4 weeks. The researcher may employ up to two assistants in the research process to assist on the skill checks using the aid another action (see page 86 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).
