The dagger master has perfected the technique of killing with a small blade.

Vink the Blade

Vink considers himself a champion of the halfling people, their greatest son and the one who defends the small folk against any larger creature that threatens them. Having experienced a fair share of mockery because of to his size, Vink's definition of threatening a halfling is very broad, including slight insults, roughhousing by larger races, and legal actions that limit halfling rights. Though he normally uses his blades against tyrants and rampaging monsters, he's been known to obliterate entire caravans of slavers, murder government officials who demean halflings or treat them as second-class citizens, and assassinate bards or actors who perform plays that treat halflings as subjects of ridicule.

Combat Encounters: Vink might attack the PCs for something he considers a slight, or work with any group he thinks advances the cause of halflings. Expressing a sincere apology and offering a compensatory gift to a halfling community usually convinces him to back down without killing anyone.

Roleplaying Suggestions: The PCs might encounter Vink as an easily-insulted, hot-tempered bravo defending halfling honor, rights, or territory. If the PCs include a halfling or have acted on behalf of a halfling community in the past, he might attempt to befriend them or seek their aid for a dangerous plan.
