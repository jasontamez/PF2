Description

A jackal's blade appears as a well-used falchion. The handle looks aged and unpleasant, but despite these cosmetic features, the blade is quite sharp, functioning as a +2 unholy falchion. The weapon inflicts particularly grievous wounds on paladins and lawful good clerics, functioning as a bane weapon against such targets. It also functions as a divine focus for worshipers of Lamashtu. When used as such for casting a spell, the user gains a +4 bonus on any concentration checks needed to complete that spell.
