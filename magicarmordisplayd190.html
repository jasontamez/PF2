straps, this +1 mithral tower shield displays no decoration or
markings on its highly reflective surface. Once per day, the
bearer of this shield can issue a challenge to a foe and ring
the shield like a gong, resulting in a resonating blast that
negates all magic in a 10-foot radius, as per antimagic field.
This effect lasts for 1 minute.
