You have trained to channel your magical energies in ways that do not harm the natural world around you.

Prerequisites: Follower of the Green Faith.

Benefit: Spells you cast that deal damage, channel negative energy, or otherwise harm life do not hurt normal or magical plants. In addition, whenever you cast a spell that utilizes, heals, or enhances normal or magical plants (such as entangle or plant growth), you cast the spell at +1 caster level.
