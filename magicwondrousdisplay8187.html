Description

This metal container looks like a hip flask for carrying alcoholic drinks except it is barely larger than a potion vial. The side of the flask may be blank or have a personalized decoration, but the screw-on stopper usually bears a mark like a shield or perhaps a featureless mask. Once per day, the bearer can drink from the flask to gain a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison and a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks for 1 hour.

If Norgorber is the bearer's patron, once per day the bearer can drink from the flask to gain a +5 competence bonus on Perception, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth checks (drinker's choice) for 1 hour. In addition, the bearer can pour acid from the flask (equivalent in volume to a standard acid flask) once per day.
