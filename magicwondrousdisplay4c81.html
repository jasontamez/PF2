Description

The empty hands are an innocuous looking pair of wellcrafted gloves made of soft, tanned brown leather. As a standard action, the wearer can cause any weapon or item he holds to become invisible for 3 minutes, during which it is clear the wearer is holding something, but it's not possible to see exactly what it is. The wearer gains a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls with an invisible weapon, a +5 circumstance bonus on opposed Bluff checks made to feint in combat or claim to be unarmed, and a +10 circumstance bonus on opposed Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon or item. This invisibility can be dismissed as a free action. The 3 minutes a held item is invisible need not be consecutive, but must be expended in 1-minute increments. Empty hands grant no bonuses against foes able to see invisible objects, as per spells like see invisibility or true seeing. Empty hands can only affect one item at a time, even if one item is held in each hand.
