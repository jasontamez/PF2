Description

An angel's clarion is a graceful trumpet
whose bell unfolds like the petals of
a flower. These trumpets are usually
platinum or silver near the mouthpiece,
transforming to a rose gold at the bell.

Three times per day when an angel's
clarion is sounded, it releases a blast
that sounds like the chiming, resonant
voices of an angelic choir. Any goodaligned
creatures in a 30-foot cone emanating from the
trumpet are washed in positive energy and healed for 3d8+5
points of damage. This energy only affects good-aligned
creatures; neutral and evil creatures receive no benefit and
undead creatures are not harmed. A carpet of flowers springs
up beneath the 30-foot cone, growing and blooming in
seconds. Any evil-aligned creatures within the area of effect
must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be treated as if in the
area of an entangle spell. The entangling flowers persist for
5 minutes.
