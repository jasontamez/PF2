1: Deceiver (Sp) silent image  3/day, invisibility 2/day, or glibness 1/day
2: Covenant of Three (Su or Sp) You may not be a hag, but you can wield hags' power in conjunction with your sisters. You count as a hag for the purpose of forming a coven. You can be part of a coven only if it has no male members. If you are already a hag (or already count as one for the purpose of forming a coven), you can use project image once per day as a spell-like ability.
3: Black Magic (Su) The Mother of Witches imbues you with the darkest power of witchcraft. You gain a grand hex, chosen from any of those available to witches. This hex's DC is equal to 10 + half your level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest); if you are a witch, you can use your hexes' DC instead. If you are not a witch or a hag, you can use this hex only once per day.

1: Witch's Trick (Sp) disguise self 3/day, misdirection 2/day, or bestow curse 1/day
2: Elder's Grace (Ex) You immediately age to the next age category, gaining all of the appropriate bonuses to your mental ability scores without taking any penalties to your physical ability scores. If you are venerable when you achieve this boon, you die and become a ghost. Any illusion effect you create gains a +2 profane bonus to the save DC. This transformation into a ghost persists even if you fail to perform your obedience.
3: Shriek of the Damned (Sp) Once per day, you can cast wail of the banshee as a spell-like ability.

Sentinel

1: Tormentor's Invocation (Sp) ill omen  3/day, blindness/deafness 2/day, or pain strike 1/day
2: Widow's Cruelty (Ex or Su) Mestama grants you a form meant to beguile and slay, as well as the power to join a witch coven. You count as a hag for the purpose of forming a coven. In addition, your nails become razor sharp, granting you two natural claw attacks that deal damage appropriate to your size (1d4 for a Medium creature). If you already had claw attacks, those attacks deal damage as though you were one size larger instead. You become female (if you weren't already) and physically attractive; depending on how drastic the changes are, you may or may not still be recognizable as your former self. Hags do not become physically attractive in this way.
3: Maiming Strike (Su) With a single ripping claw, you destroy a creature's virility and wreck its physical and magical potency. Three times per day, you can make a single claw attack as a standard action. In addition to taking normal claw damage, the creature struck must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or become permanently mutilated in a physical and spiritual way. The victim takes a -6 penalty to its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (chosen by you) and on caster level checks, concentration checks, and spell penetration checks. The victim can no longer sire or birth children. This is a curse effect.
