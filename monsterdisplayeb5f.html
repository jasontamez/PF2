Special Abilities

Aided Insight (Su) Once per day, a pseudosphinx can tap into the wisdom of its ancestors to answer a question for another creature. To do so, the pseudosphinx attempts a Wisdom check, gaining a bonus on the check equal to the querent's level and treating the result of the check as the result of an appropriate Knowledge check. The pseudosphinx must be touching the querent to use this ability.

Description

Pseudosphinxes are cat-sized, fairylike creatures thought to be distant cousins to the larger and better-known true sphinxes. They most resemble gynosphinxes, though the pseudosphinxes' monkeylike heads and tiny bodies ensure that the two species are never confused for each other. A typical pseudosphinx is 2 feet long and weighs 10 pounds.

Pseudosphinxes are rarely found in groups, and scholars are unsure whether to attribute their cryptic origins to elusive demeanors or amnesic memories. Whether they're the misbegotten progeny of generations of lesser sphinxes or the result of some magical experiment in the same deserts where sphinxes are found, none can say.

A pseudosphinx can serve as the familiar for a 7th-level spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat.
