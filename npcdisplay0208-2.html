Tactics

Before Combat The rogue relishes combat, but often prefers to hide the full extent of his abilities until he's completely surrounded, the better to take his enemies by surprise and make use of Whirlwind Attack.
During Combat The rogue charges into combat, trying to get in the middle of as many enemies as possible before using Whirlwind Attack, laughing and singing prayers as he lays waste to his enemies.

The dancing dervish spins as a way to focus himself on achieving harmony with the gods.

Lesath the Desert Sting

Lesath is a troubled man who acutely feels the pain of separation from the divine, and only when he has a sword in hand do his dark thoughts stop. For him, the dance of the sword is a means of finding peace and spiritual tranquility. He dances several times per day (whether or not he is in combat) as a silent prayer ritual. Afterward, he meditates to focus his memory on the joy of the prayer, sometimes unconsciously speaking some truth he learned from this connection. Though he often springs into battle if a cause seems justified and in keeping with his god's will, the truth is that the fighting is more important to him than the reason for it.

Combat Encounters: Lesath might watch over a group of pilgrims and rebuff any attempts by the PCs to interfere or communicate, or he might guard a holy site and refuse to allow the PCs to trespass.

Roleplaying Suggestions: The PCs might discover Lesath surrounded by a ring of slain enemies, meditating and perhaps unknowingly speaking words of prophecy or divine truth. They might also find themselves saddled with the job of keeping him out of trouble.
