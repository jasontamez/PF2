Description

Etchings of small, hairy folk adorn this knotty +1 thundering club. Once per day as a standard action, a wielder can animate his own hair to wield the club without his hands for 4 rounds, as if the korrigan club had the dancing weapon special ability. A wielder's head hair or beard hair must be at least 2 feet long to activate this ability. Sundering the wielder's hair (hp 2) immediately causes the korrigan club to fall to the ground and renders the wielder unable to activate this special ability until the lost length regrows.
