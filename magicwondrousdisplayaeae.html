Description

This leather bottle is filled to the brim with frothy green
liquid. As a full-round action, a witch can target the bottle
with any hex (but not a greater or grand hex) she knows
that targets a single creature, transferring its effects to the
brew within, which congeals into a sticky syrup. Any creature
can use this syrup as a dose of injury poison (including the
5% chance to affect the user if she does not possess the
poison use class feature). Any creature struck by a weapon
coated in this syrup must save against the hex (DC 15) or
be affected as if the witch had targeted them with the hex
directly. The syrup counts as a poison and is a magical effect.
If the hex cannot affect a target more than once every 24
hours, subsequent doses of the syrup are similarly ineffective
against that target. Once imbued with the power of a hex,
the syrup lasts for 24 hours before reverting into useless,
harmless liquid.
