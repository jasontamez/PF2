Killing fuels your rage.

Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.

Benefit:  When you are raging and your attack reduces an enemy to negative hit points or kills it, you regain 1 round of rage. You may only use this feat if the fallen enemy had at least as many Hit Dice as you. You can only gain this benefit once per round.
