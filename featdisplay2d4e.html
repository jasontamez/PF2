The calming effects of pesh make you difficult to disturb.

Prerequisites: Sahir-Afiyun or pesh addict.

Benefit:  When you take a dose of pesh, in addition to its normal initial effect, you gain a +2 bonus on saves against emotion and fear effects. Once per day, if you fail a saving throw against an emotion or fear effect while you are under the initial effect of pesh, you can attempt another saving throw 1 round later at the same DC.
