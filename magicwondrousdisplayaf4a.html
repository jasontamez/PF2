Description

The diamond-shaped gems in these metal headbands are typically one of two colors, each corresponding to a different esoteric element: onyx (void) and pink (wood); these elements are found on pages 6-9 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Occult Origins. The diadem's gem grants the wearer greater control over its associated element.

While worn by a kineticist, this item increases the damage dealt by the kineticist's simple and composite blasts that match the element of the inlaid gem by 1d6 points (for a lesser esoteric diadem), 2d6 points (for an esoteric diadem), or 3d6 points (for a greater esoteric diadem). If the blast is a physical blast, the extra damage dice from the esoteric diadem increase to d8s instead of d6s. These extra damage dice don't multiply on a critical hit, and they don't apply to blasts with form infusions that don't apply the extra damage from elemental overflow.

Other esoteric diadem variants exist for other little-known kineticist elements.
