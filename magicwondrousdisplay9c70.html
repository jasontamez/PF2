Description

This small star is made of a brittle metal alloy and attaches easily to armor or a gauntlet. Each of the star's points is keyed to a specific god and can serve as a holy symbol for that god. As a standard action, the wearer can break off one of the star's points to activate an effect unique to that point. Once a point has been broken off, it can't be activated again and can no longer be used as a holy symbol for the deity to which it is keyed.

When broken off, each of the godstar's points provide effects as follows.

Abadar: The point emanates truth-telling magic in a 5-foot radius, as per zone of truth, for 10 minutes. Any creature that succeeds at a DC 13 Will save ignores this effect.

Asmodeus: The wearer gains fire resistance 5 and her weapon attacks gain the flaming weapon special ability for 1 minute.

Iomedae: If the wearer is under the effects of a fear effect, she can attempt a new saving throw against it with a +4 sacred bonus. The wearer can use this ability even if a fear effect would normally prevent her from doing so.

Irori: The wearer can attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature, even if she is untrained in the relevant Knowledge skill. She gains a +8 bonus on this check.

Torag: The point transforms into a +1 warhammer when wielded by the owner of the godstar until it leaves her possession or after 1 minute. The wielder is considered proficient with this weapon for the duration of this effect, after which the weapon becomes a nonmagical masterwork warhammer.
