Heroic Defiance

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 162</a>
You struggle on when others would fall.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc50c.html?ItemName=Diehard">Diehard</a>, <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance</a>, base Fortitude save +8.

Benefit:  Once per day as an immediate action you can delay the onset of one harmful condition or affliction (such as panicked, paralyzed, stunned, and so on), including permanent and instantaneous conditions. Activating this feat delays the onset of the condition until the end of your next turn, after which time the condition takes its normal effect. This feat has no effect on hit point damage or ability damage.

Mythic Heroic Defiance

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 66</a>
You ignore harmful effects that would bring others down.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7923.html?ItemName=Heroic%20Defiance">Heroic Defiance.</a>

Benefit:  Once per day as an immediate action, you can attempt to negate the onset of one harmful condition or affliction (such as panicked, paralyzed, stunned, and so on) that allowed a saving throw for its onset, not including permanent and instantaneous conditions. When you do so, attempt a Will saving throw with a bonus equal to your tier against the original DC of the effect. If you succeed, the condition is negated. If you fail, the onset is delayed until the end of your next turn, after which it takes its normal effect. This feat has no effect on hit point damage or ability damage.

This effect is separate from the use of non-mythic Heroic Defiance.
