Description

This primitive hyena mask is usually made of leather, but may be made of soft metal like copper or carved from an animal's skull. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Handle Animal and Heal checks. The wearer can smell when nearby creatures are in heat or otherwise especially fertile (creatures such as humans that can breed at any time of the year always smell fertile unless they are barren).

If Lamashtu is the wearer's patron, the mask counts as an unholy symbol and a hole for a third eye appears in its forehead. The wearer can use summon monster II once per day to summon a fiendish hyena, which obeys the wearer as if they shared a common language. The wearer may interbreed with animals within one size category of the wearer's size. The offspring of such unions are members of the mother's race with the fiendish simple template and bear monstrous aesthetic features of the father's race.
