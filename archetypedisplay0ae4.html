Spire defenders are magi who train themselves to accompany sages and archaeologists who venture from the Mordant Spire, acting as aids and bodyguards. Because they often operate in difficult terrain-narrow trenches in dig sites, flooded dungeons, and tight corridors in ancient ruins' spire defenders place mobility and agility at a premium. As a result, they eschew armor entirely. Most spire defenders are elves-it's exceptionally rare for a non-elf to be granted access to the training required to take this archetype (nonelves need GM approval to take this archetype). A spire defender has the following class features.

Weapon Proficiency:  A spire defender is proficient with all light and one-handed simple and martial weapons, as well as one exotic light or one-handed melee weapon that has the disarm or trip special feature. This replaces the magus's normal weapon proficiencies.

Bonus Feats (Ex):  At 1st level, the spire defender gains Combat Expertise and Dodge as bonus feats, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. The spire defender is not prof icient in any kind of armor or shield. The spire defender does not have the magus' ability to ignore arcane spell failure from armor; however, if the spire defender becomes prof icient in light armor, he automatically gains the magus's ability to ignore the arcane spell failure chance of light armor. If he becomes prof icient in medium armor, at 7th level he ignores medium armor's chance of arcane spell failure. If he becomes prof icient in heavy armor, at 13th level he ignores heavy armor's chance of arcane spell failure. This replaces the magus's normal armor prof iciencies.

Arcane Augmentation (Su):  At 4th level, a magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant himself a +5 competence bonus for 1 minute to one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Perception, Stealth, and Swim. For every three levels beyond 4th, the magus gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +10 at 19th level. This ability replaces the spell recall ability.
