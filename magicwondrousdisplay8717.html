Description

This pear-shaped flask contains a metallic-green liquid suffused with small pulsing globules. This elixir fuses with the magical essence flowing through the imbiber's veins, enhancing the potency of spells at the cost of his health. For the next minute, any spells the imbiber casts that deal hit point damage deal an additional amount of damage of the same type equal to the spell level to both the target and the imbiber.
