Your mount can make heroic leaps.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat</a>, <a href="featdisplaycbce.html?ItemName=Ride-By%20Attack">Ride-By Attack</a>, Ride 5 ranks.

Benefit:  Your mount is always considered to have a running start when using Acrobatics to jump. You can expend one use of mythic power to grant your mount a +10 bonus on an Acrobatics check, or a +20 bonus if the check is made to jump.

When making a mounted charge, you can guide your mount to leap over a foe between your starting position and the target of your charge. You make a Ride check or your mount makes an Acrobatics check (whichever is lower) during the charge, using the rules for the leap task under the Ride skill. If the height you clear with that check exceeds the creature's height, you jump over it and continue your charge on the opposite side. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, you can vault over your target while making a Ride-By Attack, allowing you to move over or through its space and continue moving on the opposite side of it. If your jump exceeds the target's height, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll for higher ground, and if any of your allies threatens the target, you treat the target as flanked for purposes of your Ride-By Attack.
