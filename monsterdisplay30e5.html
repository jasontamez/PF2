Yrldak

This breathtaking, giant-sized woman's raven hair falls to her
ankles. Her skin is as pale as the glowing moon, and her ebon
eyes deeply pensive.

Special Abilities

Shears (Su) Yrldak's shears function as a +5 keen scimitar
when she wields them, instead of as a +5 mithral keen
speed scimitar like the shears wielded by fully grown norns.


Sister Seeking (Su) An immature norn separated from her
sisters has an innate ability to locate them across any distance
on the same plane. The norn can sense when she is facing in
the direction of one or both of her sisters, as well as in which
direction they are moving. This sense does not grant a norn
the ability to assess distance to her sisters. Once the norn
rejoins one or both of her sisters, she loses this ability.


Description

The norn known as Yrldak and her sisters Surlda and
Hilde have served as handmaidens for Magdh, prophetess
and seer of the mysterious Eldest who have ruled the
First World since the gods were young. Serving as their
mistress's agents, these norns protect her long-term
interests wherever possible, but especially on
the Material Plane, where Magdh lacks direct
influence. As one of the multiverse's most
prescient beings, Magdh is capable of
seeing farther down the long lines of
probability and fate than the norns
themselves, and the triumvirate often
takes on dangerous and enigmatic
missions on Magdh's behalf.


It was on one such venture that Yrldak
met her demise upon the Material
Plane, when facing a particularly
greedy white dragon who thought
the norn trio's treasure would make
a good addition to its hoard. As
happens to all norns who die
outside the First World, Yrldak
was reborn on her native plane,
and is quickly growing while
traversing Golarion looking for her
sisters. Exhibiting the dark features of
a reborn norn, whose hair and eyes lighten
as they age, Yrldak is distinctive among her
kind, and though her ebon hair reveals her
still undeveloped power, Yrldak is a force
to be reckoned with if any stand in her
way or tempt fate in her presence. Eager
to rejoin her sisters, Yrldak might seek
the aid of adventurers, to whom she may
promise wealth, prophecy, and other
boons if they assist her in her quest.
