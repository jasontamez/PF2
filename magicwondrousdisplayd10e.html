Description

This cloth hat is floppy and shapeless. It offers its wearer an
unusual amount of protection against particularly devastating
blows. Once per day when struck by a critical hit, the wearer
can spend an immediate action to convert the bonus damage
of the critical hit into nonlethal damage. The cap has no effect
if the wearer is immune to nonlethal damage.
