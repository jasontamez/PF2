The staff allows use of the following spells. <ul><li>Planar adaptation (1 charge; Advanced Player's Guide)</li><li>Planar binding (2 charges)</li><li>Plane shift (5 charges)</li></ul> If the staff of the planes is fully charged, the wielder can deliberately snap the staff, causing it do shatter into thousands of pieces but opening a gate to a plane of the wielder's choice. This can only be used for planar travel, and the connection lasts for 1 minute, without requiring the wielder's concentration. If used in this way, the staff cannot be repaired or restored.
