You are a dragon, powerful and feared. Not even magic can sway your thoughts or weaken your resolve.

Prerequisites: Wis 17, base will save +10, any lawful alignment, dragon type.

Benefit: If you are affected by a mind-affecting enchantment or necromancy effect and fail your saving throw, you can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. You get only this one extra chance to succeed on your saving throw.
