Some heroes don't believe in fancy rules or high creeds or big flowery speeches, they just want to kill evil things, spend time with friends, and swap great tales over a good meal and tasty drinks. Not as stuffy or restrictive as a fullfledged knighthood, in their hearts chevaliers are just good people who want to celebrate the good things in life and fight evil wherever it dares to tread.

Chevaliers welcome all like-minded folk regardless of religion, though most of them worship Cayden Cailean. Most are fighters, rogues, or barbarians, but sorcerers, clerics, and bards are not unheard of. Chevaliers often wear golden pins noting their patron liege or deity or the token of a lover or other for whom they fight. Membership is easily obtained by swearing an oath in the presence of another chevalier and invoking the name of who they fight for or the figure that embodies their desire to do good in the world. An adventurer-turned- innkeeper in a frontier town, a band of travelers looking for bandits, and a would-be dragonslayer might all be chevaliers. They mix lofty intentions, unusual combat techniques, and stubborn determination into a strangely effective combination.

The following are class features of the chevalier prestige class.

Aura of Courage (Su): A chevalier has an aura of courage like that of a 3rd-level paladin.

Recklessness (Ex): Sometimes hasty action proves more useful than even the best laid plans. A chevalier gains a morale bonus equal to his class level on attack and damage rolls on the round he enters a battle. A chevalier only gains this bonus against an opponent (or group of opponents) once per day. Thus, he cannot leave a battle and reengage moments later to gain the benefits of this ability more than once in the same battle.

Controlled Charge (Ex): At 2nd level, a chevalier no longer takes a -2 penalty to AC when charging.

Stubborn Mind (Ex): At 3rd level, a chevalier gains an incredibly stubborn determination. If he is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails his saving throw, he can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. He gets only this one extra chance to succeed on his saving throw (though this does not prevent him from using other means to break the effect, such as a rogue's slippery mind ability).

Poison Immunity (Ex): At 3rd level, a chevalier becomes immune to poison.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, a chevalier can smite evil as if he were a paladin of his character level.
