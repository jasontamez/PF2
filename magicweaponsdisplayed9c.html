Description

This +1 distance net seems lighter than expected and is
slightly sticky to the touch. Three times per day, the wielder
may speak the command word and throw the net of snaring
at a target. This is a ranged touch attack with a range of 40
feet. The net immediately grows by two size categories. If the
attack hits, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save
or become entangled. So long as the wielder retains control
of the trailing rope, he may attempt or otherwise act on a
grapple as a free action that does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. Speaking the command word again shrinks the
item to normal size so long as no creature is confined within it.
