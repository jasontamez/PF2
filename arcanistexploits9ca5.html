Strength Normal
When casting a spell, the arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to make the spell being cast appear to be a different spell. The spell can be disguised as any other spell that the arcanist knows. This exploit raises the DC for a Spellcraft check to correctly identify the spell being cast by double the arcanist's caster level. Identification attempts that fail by an amount less than double the arcanist's caster level mistakenly identify the spell being cast as the false spell chosen by the arcanist.
