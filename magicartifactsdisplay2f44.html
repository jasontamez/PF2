Description

The witch ice shard is crafted from witch ice, a mysterious substance found only beneath the windswept reaches of Witch Queen's demesne. This glittering cerulean ice has many fell uses, but one of the Queen's favorites is as a dread prison for her foes. Once prepared by Queen, the witch ice shard absorbs the soul of the first non-fey to touch it as a trap the soul spell. Worse yet, anyone trapped within becomes fuel for the crystal's bearer, painfully consumed by the power of the shard as their new owner drains their life force away to use as they wish. A fey creature may absorb one of the trapped creature's levels to gain an additional use of one of its daily supernatural or spell-like abilities. When the trapped creature's last level is drained, they are forever consumed and cannot be returned to life by any magic short of a wish or miracle. This particular shard possesses Tessa's soul, granting its bearer 10 levels worth of power. Each time one is used, Tessa loses a level until her soul is completely consumed.

Shattering a witch ice shard frees a trapped soul, who then must make a DC 15 Fortitude save for every level lost (failure results in the level drain being permanent). Unlike most artifacts, a witch ice shard is fragile. The crystal has a Hardness of 10, 15 hp and a Break DC of 25.
