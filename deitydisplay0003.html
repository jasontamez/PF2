Obedience

After reciting a traditional prayer to Torag, either work at a forge or strike a small replica of an anvil or a sizable flat stone with a hammer for at least 10 minutes. If the sound of your hammer draws a creature near, encourage it to join in your worship of the Father of Creation. If hostilities become inevitable, leap into the fray with a battle shout in praise of Torag. Perform some small act toward maintaining your weapon, such as sharpening or polishing it, as you conclude your obedience with another prayer to Torag's might and wisdom. Alternatively, if you have created something through this effort, grant it to the next person you meet who strikes you as fair and honorable. Gain a +1 sacred bonus on all attack rolls made with warhammers.

Divine Gift

Nethys Note: See <a href="rulese221.html?Name=Divine%20Gifts&amp;Category=Role%20of%20the%20Divine">here</a> for details on how to gain a Divine Gift
The recipient can perform a 10-minute prayer (this can be part of her daily ritual to prepare spells) to gain divine insight into defense and strategic situations for the next 24 hours. During this time, the character gains a pool of 20 defense points. She can allocate these points among any number of recipients as untyped bonuses to AC or on saving throws, to a maximum of 5 points per target (a single target can receive this bonus only to AC or to saving throws, not both). She can reallocate these points as a standard action any point during these 24 hours, but each time she does so, the total pool of defense points available for the next allocation is reduced by 5.

1: Strategic Warrior (Sp) anticipate peril 3/day, status 2/day, glyph of warding 1/day
2: Sensibility of Crafting (Su) Your understanding of the inner workings of magical crafting has won you a protective boon from your ancestors and from Torag himself, allowing you to better avoid powers drawn from magical items. You gain a +4 sacred bonus on any saving throw against an effect generated by a magic item. This includes spells cast from scrolls, staves, or wands.
3: Sacred Crafting (Ex) You are granted insight into the finest techniques for crafting magic items, glimpsing secrets of forgotten master smiths and glimpsing the revelations of ancient dwarven masters. When calculating the base cost for creating an item, perform all the calculations and then reduce the base cost by 10%. This discount affects the crafting time as well as the final price of the item. In addition, you can use fabricate once per day as a spell-like ability. Though you can't create magic items with the fabricate spell, you may use it to create items that you later enhance magically.

Exalted

1: Forgecrafter (Sp) crafter's fortune 3/day, fox's cunning 2/day, or greater magic weapon 1/day
2: Ironskin (Ex) Your skin is as thick and tough as that of a dwarf who's worked the forge for 50 years, every scratch and burn associated with the memory of a masterpiece you've realized in stone or steel. As a free action, you can toughen your skin further, gaining DR 10/chaotic and evil. Dismissing this ability is also a free action. This ability lasts a number rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). The rounds don't need to be consecutive.
3: Hammerfist Ally (Sp) You can bring forth an ancient stone construct forged specifically to protect the beloved followers of the Father of Creation. Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a stone golem to aid you. You gain telepathy with the golem to a range of 100 feet. The golem follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home. The golem takes the form of a sculpted dwarf hero wielding two massive warhammers, the holy symbol of Torag hanging prominently around its neck. Its statistics remain unchanged despite these cosmetic alterations.

Sentinel

1: Battlefield Protector (Sp) sanctuary 3/day, shield of faith 2/day, prayer 1/day
2: Holy Artificer (Su) The spirit of an ancient warrior or artisan guides your hand when you set your mind toward creation, inspiring you and helping you perfect your craft. You gain the artificer's touch granted power from the Artifice domain if you don't already have access to it. Use your character level instead of cleric level to determine the power of your artificer's touch.
3: Earthen Smite (Su) You call upon your connection with the earth and its hidden strength to levy it behind your holy attacks. Whenever you use your smite evil ability, you can choose to add 2d6 points of acid damage to your damage roll. If you don't have access to smite evil, you can instead add 2d6 points of acid damage to a single attack against an evil opponent three times per day. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. If you miss or if the target is not evil, the use is wasted.

Paladin Code

Paladins of Torag are dedicated to protecting not just the lives but the way of life for those under their charge, and hold the ways of their chosen people as holy, especially when they are the centuries-old works and traditions of an entire race. Their tenets include the following affirmations. <ul><li>My word is my bond. When I give my word formally, I defend my oath to my death. Traps lie in idle banter or thoughtless talk, and so I watch my tongue.</li><li>I am at all times truthful, honorable, and forthright, but my allegiance is to my people. I will do what is necessary to serve them, including misleading others if need be.</li><li>I respect the forge, and never sully it with half-hearted work. My creations reflect the depth of my faith, and I will not allow flaws save in direst need.</li><li>Against my people's enemies, I will show no mercy. I will not allow their surrender, except when strategy warrants. I will defeat them, yet even in the direst struggle, I will act in a way that brings honor to Torag.</li></ul>

Divine Fighting Technique



Torag's Patient Strikes

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 31</a>
Copies of Lessons of the Father, the divine fighting manual of Torag, are somewhat rare outside of the Five Kings Mountains, as tradition mandates that all copies of Lessons of the Father must be scribed by hand in Dwarven on iron sheets and bound between slabs of stone hand-carved by a cleric of Torag. As a result, these tomes are somewhat cumbersome to transport (even the smallest copy of the book weighs 50 pounds, and most exceed 100 pounds in weight). Those who have mastered the Lessons of the Father are highly respected within the faith.

Initial Benefit: Whenever you wield a warhammer, add your Wisdom bonus to the total number of attacks of opportunity that you can make per round. These additional attacks of opportunity don't stack with those granted by Combat Reflexes, but this benefit counts as Combat Reflexes for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites and prestige class requirements. In addition, you can make attacks of opportunity while you're flat-footed.

Advanced Prerequisites: Divine Fighting Technique, Vital Strike, Weapon Focus (warhammer), base attack bonus +10.

Advanced Benefit: Once per round, before you make an attack of opportunity with a warhammer, you can declare an opportunistic strike. If the attack hits, you can apply the effects of your Vital Strike feat. You can apply the Improved Vital Strike or Greater Vital Strike feat instead if you have either of those feats. If you confirm a critical hit with an opportunistic strike, you can attempt a disarm or trip combat maneuver check against the target as a free action-this combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
