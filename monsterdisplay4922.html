Special Abilities

Arcane Scavenger (Su) As a standard action, a murajau can attach an item to his shell. Such attached items can't be activated or used until removed. The items do not take up any body slots. For each magical item attached, the murajau gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and on Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects. A murajau may gain a maximum +3 bonus from this ability. Removing an item from a willing or helpless murajau is a standard action; removing an item from an unwilling murajau requires a successful steal combat maneuver. The items are considered fastened, granting the murajau a +5 bonus to CMD against steal attempts.

Description

Murajaus are nomadic creatures that travel in an eternal circuit across the seas. Legends claim they were originally servitors of a powerful marid ruler, until the ruler decreed they were to escort a foreign prince to her city, and were not to return without him. Upon arriving at the foreign kingdom, the murajaus discovered that the prince had recently perished from illness. Believing that they are unable to return home by royal decree, they have wandered endlessly for generations.

Whatever the truth behind these tales, marids shun murajaus, and malevolent races often take advantage of them. Still, murajaus are usually hospitable, aiding lost travelers and allowing others to camp with them. Murajaus are even sought out for their knowledge of safe passages and obscure locales, as well as their eye for magic items.

A typical murajau is 8 feet long and weighs 1,000 pounds.
