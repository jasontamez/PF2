Description

The wearer of this slender white leather
glove may, as a standard action, press it
against any surface or object and cause
a luminous handprint to appear. This
print glows any color the wearer wishes,
sheds light as a candle, and is easily
visible from a distance of up to 60 feet. Such handprints last for
1 day before fading away. The glowing handprint matches the
wearer's hand in terms of size, position of fingers, and so on.
