Description

This metal badge of a rampant griffon, lion, horse, or similar
heraldic creature must be attached to a shield or armor to
function. Attaching or removing it requires a DC 15 Craft
(armor) check, 10 minutes, and appropriate tools. Its powers
only function if the wearer of the shield or armor has the
channel energy and smite abilities. If the wearer dispatches
an opponent with a smite attack (killing it, destroying it, or
reducing its hit points below 0), she may expend one use of
her channel energy ability as a swift action that round.
