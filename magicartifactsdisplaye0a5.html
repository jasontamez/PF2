Description

The boss of this large black shield resembles a deformed skull of tarnished silver. The shield bears many dents and scratches from past battles.

The Shield of Xin-Undoros is a +5 heavy steel shield that makes its bearer unnaturally strong and resilient like a rune giant, granting a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Strength as long as the shield is readied. As a standard action, the bearer can increase his size by up to two size categories, to a maximum of Gargantuan. For each size category increased, the bearer gains a +2 size bonus to Constitution and Strength and takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity. The bearer can shrink back to his normal size with another standard action; the effect also ends if he loses the shield.

When readied, the Shield of Xin-Undoros also grants the bearer spell resistance 31. The bearer can ready an action to attempt to reflect a spell; if a spellcaster fails her caster level check to overcome the spell resistance granted by the shield, the shield's bearer can reflect the spell back at its caster as per <a href="spelldisplay0095.html?ItemName=spell%20turning">spell turning</a>.

Destruction

The shield explodes if an enemy successfully targets the bearer of the shield with a spell that overcomes the shield's spell resistance and then, within 1 round, succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver check against the shield that deals enough damage to destroy it in a single blow. The explosion of the shield's destruction deals 12d8 points of sonic damage to each creature and object within 30 feet (no save).
