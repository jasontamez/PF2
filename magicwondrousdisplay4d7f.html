Description

This elaborate red and black quill contains an endless reservoir of red ink that resembles fresh blood. Once per day, when within 5 feet of a living creature with -1 or fewer hit points, the bearer can activate this quill as a standard action by scribing a short sentence in the air with it describing the dying creature's death. If the victim fails a DC 15 Will save, it dies, and the bearer gains a +5 profane bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks, a +1 profane bonus to caster level for spell-like abilities, and a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 10 minutes per Hit Die of the victim.
