Description

This gilded suit of +2 banded mail is decorated with images of celestial beings holding their weapons high. Legion armor is typically worn by high-ranking angels and archons directly combating the forces of evil on the Material Plane.

Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of a suit of legion armor can cast the spell spiritual ally with a duration of 1 minute. This ally typically takes on the appearance of an imposing angelic warrior. At any time while the armor's spiritual ally is conjured, the wearer of a suit of legion armor can dismiss the effect as a standard action, causing the spiritual ally to explode with a thunderous choir of voices and blaring trumpets. This effect causes each evil-aligned creatures within 100 feet to become shaken unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Will save.
