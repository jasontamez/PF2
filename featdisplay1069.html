Craft Staff (Item Creation)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 120</a>
You can create magic staves.

Prerequisites: Caster level 11th.

Benefit: You can create any staff whose prerequisites you meet. Crafting a staff takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a staff, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price. A newly created staff has 10 charges. See the magic item creation rules in Magic Items for more information.
