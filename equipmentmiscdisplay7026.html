Description

When you imbibe this syrupy black serum, your blood thins dramatically and gushes forth from even minor wounds. Anytime you take bleed damage, any creatures adjacent to you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the amount of bleed damage taken) or be nauseated for 1 round. A dose of bloodgorge lasts for 1 hour.
