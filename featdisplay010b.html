You have two colors of scales, which mark you as special.


Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay37a7.html?ItemName=Draconic%20Aspect">Draconic Aspect or dragon-scaled racial
trait</a>, kobold.

Benefit:  Choose an additional color for your Draconic
Aspect feat or dragon-scaled racial trait. You gain the
benefits of both this color and the color you originally
chose. (If you have both Draconic Aspect and dragon-scaled,
this benefit applies to both.) If you gain abilities that rely on
scale color, choose which color gains the benefits.
