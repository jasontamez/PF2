Description

This unobtrusive but fashionable velvet choker allows the wearer to change certain aspects of her physical form. Once per day on command, the choker can alter the wearer's body in one of the following ways: adopt the physical characteristics of a different gender, appear up to 10 years older or younger, become up to 10% taller or shorter, or become up to 10% thinner or heavier. This is a polymorph effect. This alteration does not change any of the wearer's statistics, such as size category or ability scores, although it does provide a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. The choker can provide only one alteration at a time, and its effects last until the choker is removed or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.
