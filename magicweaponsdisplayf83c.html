Description

This scalpel-sharp greatsword has a simple black handle and crosspiece, and is made of unusually dark steel etched with an organic wave pattern. Once per day, the wielder of this +1 keen greatsword can attempt to assassinate a target, per the slayer advanced talent of the same name. If the wielder is not a slayer, he must spend a full-round action studying the target before attempting the assassination, and the target's DC to avoid death is 15. In the hands of a slayer, the sword's enhancement bonus on attack rolls is 2 better against a studied target, and the DC to avoid death from an assassination attempt increases by 2. Additionally, if the assassination attempt is successful, the target is decapitated instead of merely slain.
