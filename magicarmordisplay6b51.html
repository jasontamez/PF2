Description

This jet-black +3 unrighteous full plate is made in the image of the armor worn by thanatotic titans and grants the wearer a fragment of their immense power. The wearer of thanatotic plate gains SR 21 against divine spells. In addition, the wearer can speak a command word to gain the benefits of air walk, break enchantment, or spell turning once per day each. Once per week, the wearer can use greater planar ally to call upon a tarry demodand.

A newly created set of thanatotic plate always includes a thanatotic visage; this is included in the price and weight. A set of thanatotic plate missing its visage has its price reduced by that of the visage.

A nonevil character who dons thanatotic plate immediately gains 4 negative levels; these negative levels can't be removed or ignored, but they disappear when the armor is removed.
