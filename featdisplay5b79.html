Menacing Bane - Feats







Menacing Bane

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 109</a>
You are deadly when you team up with allies against a single foe.

Prerequisites: Bane class feature.

Benefit:  You can use your bane class feature to imbue a melee weapon with the menacing special weapon ability (Advanced Player's Guide 288) instead of bane. You can spend a swift action to switch between the two special weapon abilities. Doing so otherwise works according to your bane class feature.

Special:  If you have the Double Bane feat, you can imbue each weapon you wield with either bane or menacing. No single weapon can have both.
