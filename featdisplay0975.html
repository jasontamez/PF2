You use your innate magic powers to target enemies and spot their weaknesses.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, dancing lights racial spell-like ability.

Benefit:  You can use your dancing lights racial spell-like ability to create one orb of penetrating light. This light grants you a +2 insight bonus on all ranged attacks made against targets within 5 feet of the light's location. You can direct this light to a new location anywhere within the spell's range as a move action, otherwise the effect functions exactly like dancing lights. You can use this ability once per day, plus an additional time per day when your caster level for your racial dancing lights spell-like ability reaches 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.
