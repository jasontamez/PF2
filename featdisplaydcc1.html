Prerequisites: <a href="racesdisplay6f1b.html?ItemName=Wyrwood">Wyrwood</a>.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can create a link between your ioun core and an active <a href="magicwondrous8768.html?FinalSlot=Ioun">ioun stone</a> you hold or carry. For as long as you gain the benefits of the linked stone, any numerical bonuses and penalties granted by the stone are increased by 1. You can maintain a link with only one ioun stone at a time. Creating a link to a new stone ends any previous links.
