Description

The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned,
and it functions normally. However, as soon as he is in a
situation requiring concentration and action against hostile
opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: the
wearer immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the
insects that magically infest the garment. He must cease all
other activities in order to scratch, shift the robe, and generally
show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and
movement of these pests.

The wearer takes a -5 penalty on initiative checks and a -2
penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to
cast a spell, he must make a concentration check (DC 20 + spell
level) or lose the spell.
