Description

This alkaline salt counteracts the properties of oozes' acid. You can apply acid neutralizer to a piece of equipment such as a weapon or shield as a move action. For 1 minute afterward, any acid damage that would be dealt to the protected equipment is reduced by 5 points. This does not reduce acid damage dealt to you or unprotected equipment.

You can apply a dose of acid neutralizer to an adjacent ooze creature by emptying the container on it. Treat this as a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When used in this way, acid neutralizer prevents the ooze creature from dealing acid damage (assuming it is normally able to do so) for 1 round.
