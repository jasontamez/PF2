The wintry origin of your magic flows like ice water in your veins.

Associated Bloodline: Boreal.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with the cold descriptor, you may select one target of the spell to be slowed (as the spell) for 1 round. A Fortitude save (DC 10 + the level of cold spell + your Charisma modifier) negates the effect.

Bloodline Powers: Sometimes you must bring the cold to your enemies.

Freezing Bolt (Sp): At 9th level, you can cause the air to erupt in freezing sleet. This 10-foot-radius burst does 1d6 points of cold damage per sorcerer level (Reflex half). The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day. This power has a range of 60 feet. This bloodline power replaces snow shroud.
