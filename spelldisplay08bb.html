Description

You magically scour the world's libraries for information that
might refresh your memory about a topic. Upon casting this
spell, the focus book's pages fill with snippets and selections
from countless books. You can spend up to 1 round per caster
level (maximum 10) reading these notes. You may cease reading
at any time, and when you do you can immediately attempt
one Knowledge check with a +1 circumstance bonus for each
round you spent studying the book (maximum +10). The writing
disappears when the spell ends, and if you fail to succeed at a
Knowledge check on the round you stop reading the notes, you
don't gain the benefits of this spell.
