You can deliver poisons deep into a foe's flesh.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7e12.html?ItemName=Vital%20Strike">Vital Strike</a>; base attack bonus +6; Craft (poison) 6 ranks or poison use class feature.

Benefit:  When you use a poisoned weapon to make a Vital Strike, you increase the poison's duration by one frequency increment (for example, a dose of large scorpion venom would last for 7 rounds instead of 6 and a dose of drow poison would last for 3 minutes instead of 2). The poison takes effect immediately and does not have an onset time.
