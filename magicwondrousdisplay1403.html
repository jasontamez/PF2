Description

This lustrous crimson cloak has an ethereal quality to it, and is unnaturally light. When the wearer speaks the item's command word, a murktouch cloak dissolves into a vortex of red fog that churns around her and extends her awareness.

The fog forms a 15-foot-radius emanation around the wearer and remains centered on her for as long as the cloak is activated. All creatures in the fog gain concealment (20% miss chance), but the wearer has blindsight within the area. The vortex is unaffected by wind or any similar effect.

Whenever the wearer casts a spell or uses an ability that requires a successful touch attack, she can attempt that touch attack against any creature within the fog, even if she is not adjacent to the targeted creature.

The cloak can be activated for up to 10 rounds per day, though these rounds need not be consecutive. Its magic can be dismissed as a free action.
