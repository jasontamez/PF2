Pathfinder savants are specialists in the theory and practice of magic, illuminating mysteries of the eldritch fabric that permeates existence. The path of the savant brings expertise in the lore of glyphs and sigils, knowledge of exotic spells, and the power to unlock the full potential of magical devices. This skill also makes savants quite valuable to adventuring parties, both in their mastery over ancient traps that utilize old magic and in their skill at identifying and utilizing magic items found in the field. Of course, with their focus on the intellectual portions of adventuring, Pathfinder savants are often ill-equipped to handle the tougher, more excruciating parts of a typical dungeon delve; melee combat, wrenching open stuck doors, and enduring dangerous and unhealthy environments are not the savant's forte. As a result, they rarely undertake solo missions, instead allying with wellrounded groups of fellow adventurers in order to interact with history and strange archaic wonders without dealing with the grislier portions of exploration all on their own. To the Pathfinder savant, this is merely a logical extension of their preferred role in exploration, but that doesn't protect them from periodic sneers and veiled insults from more physically focused companions. Of course, most such associates are quick to beg forgiveness when, inevitably, the savant is needed to decipher the workings of a strange magical device or to call upon their significant magical power to solve problems that cannot be dealt with through brawn alone.

The following are class features of the Pathfinder savant prestige class.

Adept Activation (Ex): A Pathfinder savant can always take 10 on Use Magic Device checks, except when activating an item blindly. A Pathfinder savant does not automatically fail a Use Magic Device check if he rolls a natural 1 on the check.

Master Scholar (Ex): A Pathfinder savant adds half his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks. He can always take 10 on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks, even if distracted or endangered.

Esoteric Magic (Ex): At each class level beyond 1st, the Pathfinder savant chooses a spell from any class's spell list and thereafter treats that spell as if it were on the spell list of the base spellcasting class for which he has the most levels; if this base spellcasting class could not normally cast that spell, it is treated as 1 level higher than it is on the original class's spell list. If he could cast the spell using his base spellcasting class, the spell's level does not increase. The spell is cast as if its type (arcane, divine, or psychic) were that of his base spellcasting class, and save DCs function as normal for spells of that class. All other restrictions of his normal spellcasting class apply. This ability does not grant other spellcasters special allowance to prepare, cast, or use spell-trigger or spell-completion items of esoteric spells (such as a sorcerer using a cure light wounds scroll prepared by the Pathfinder savant).

Glyph-Finding (Ex): At 2nd level, a Pathfinder savant can use Spellcraft to find writing-based magical traps (including glyphs, runes, sigils, and symbols) in the same way a rogue can use Perception to search for traps.

Scroll Master (Su): At 3rd level, a Pathfinder savant can use his own caster level instead of the item's caster level when using a scroll or other spell-completion item.

Quick Identification (Sp): At 4th level, a Pathfinder savant can use identify as a swift action (caster level equals his character level). He can do this once per day per 2 class levels.

Sigil Master (Su): A 5th level, a Pathfinder savant receives a bonus equal to his class level on saving throws against writing-based magical traps, and if he succeeds at the save, he does not trigger the trap. Such a trap is not disabled, and if he leaves the trap's area and then reenters it, the trap can trigger again. A Pathfinder savant also receives this bonus on saving throws against the effects of such traps triggered by others.

Analyze Dweomer (Sp): At 6th level, a Pathfinder savant can use analyze dweomer for up to 1 round per class level per day. He can use this ability in 1-round increments.

Silence Master (Su): A 6th-level Pathfinder savant can to activate spell-trigger, spell-completion, and command-word items silently, substituting a magical gesture for the necessary words. He cannot use this ability in circumstances where he could not cast a spell with somatic components. He must know how to activate the item normally for this ability to work. Three times per day, he can cast a spell of 6th level or lower as if he were using a silent metamagic rod.

Dispelling Master (Su): At 7th level, if the Pathfinder savant prepares and casts spells like a wizard, he can spontaneously convert any 3rd-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into dispel magic or any 6th-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into greater dispel magic, as a good-aligned cleric converts prepared spells into cure spells. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds dispel magic and greater dispel magic to his list of spells known. Every time he successfully uses either of these spells to make a targeted dispel or counterspell, he heals a number of hit points equal to the caster level of the effect dispelled or counterspelled.

Symbol Master (Su): At 8th level, a Pathfinder savant gains power over magical symbol spells (such as symbol of death). When he casts any symbol spell, the save DC to resist its effects, the Perception DC to notice the symbol, and the Disable Device DC to remove the symbol increase by 2. Once per day as an immediate action, the Pathfinder savant can double the bonus granted by his sigil master ability when he attempts a saving throw against a symbol. He can activate this ability after he rolls the saving throw, but must do so before the results are revealed. A Pathfinder savant does not automatically fail a saving throw against a symbol effect on a natural 1.

Spellcasting Master (Ex): At 9th level, a Pathfinder savant can focus his mind three times per day as a swift action. Once he's focused in this way, any spells he casts for the remainder of that round do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Spells with a duration of concentration that he casts in this round persist for a number of rounds after the Pathfinder savant ceases concentrating equal to his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).

Item Master (Su): At 10th level, a Pathfinder savant can spend an hour focusing his energies on a single noncharged magic item that requires an action to activate. At the end of this hour, that item becomes attuned to the Pathfinder savant, and from that point on, that specific item can use the Pathfinder savant's caster level to resolve its effects rather than the item's caster level. A Pathfinder savant can change which item is attuned to him by repeating the attunement ritual, but he loses attunement to the previous item. A Pathfinder savant can have only one item attuned to him at a time.
