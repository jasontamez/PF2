Description

This iridescent kilt seems stitched together from thousands of tiny scales. When an aquatic creature with a tail dons the shimmering kilt, her tail transforms into legs and feet, allowing her to walk on land. The wearer loses her swim speed but gains a base land speed of 30 feet (or 20 feet if the wearer is Small or smaller). This transformation lasts until the shimmering kilt is removed.

As a standard action, the wearer can cause the shimmering kilt to take on the appearance of any suitable garb that covers the legs, such as trousers or a long skirt. The shimmering kilt retains all its properties, including its weight, when so disguised. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of the shimmering kilt when it is disguised.
