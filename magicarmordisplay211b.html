Description

This +2 spiked splint mail is fashioned from hacked-off chunks of tanned hide and held together by humanoid spines. Used by orcs of the Broken Spine clan in Belkzen, these sets of armor are seen as a status symbol, and are adorned with trophies from slain foes, such as wayfinders. This armor grants its wearer the constrict ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 298), dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + the wearer's Strength modifier.

The vertebrae of the spines adorning the backbreaker mail are sharpened, acting as +1 human bane armor spikes.
