You spread chaos wherever you go.

Prerequisites: 10 Hit Dice, chaotic neutral alignment.

Benefit: You can store a number of <a href="rules6336.html?Name=Shifts%20and%20Affirmations&amp;Category=Alignment%20(Unchained)">affirmations</a> up to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to use at any time, not just within the next 24 hours. You can use an affirmation to cast <a href="spelldisplaye11f.html?ItemName=confusion,%20lesser">lesser confusion</a> as a spell-like ability as a standard action, with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice. The duration of this effect on a failed save is 1d4 rounds. Lastly, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against lawful creatures. This is an alignment-based effect.

Residual: If you have this feat but are no longer chaotic neutral, you continue to gain the +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage against lawful creatures.
