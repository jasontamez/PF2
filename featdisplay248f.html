You have studied the life and works of the aasimar Sulunai, who led the people of Tianjing in a time of nationwide chaos. You know that second chances are opportunities for salvation.

Prerequisites: Aasimar.

Benefit: Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you rerolls an ability check, saving throw, or skill check, you can give the creature a +2 insight bonus on the new roll as an immediate action. You can also cast divine favor as a spell-like ability once per day, using your character level as your caster level.
