Anyone who questions the martial prowess of halflings should keep quiet around feisty hotspurs, as these diminutive bravos excel at poking holes in large people who underestimate them.

Lylin Dalthainol

Growing up in a rough neighborhood, Lylin had to learn at a young age to fight fast and dirty. Her grace and feisty nature caught the attention of a traveling swordmaster and assassin, who took in the halfling as a student and raised her as a daughter. He cultivated her kill-or-be-killed nature, and trained her to be fearless and utterly ruthless in both battle and life. Her former master is long dead, but she has taken his lessons to heart, becoming a bold and competent killer. These days she's something of a loner, but still keeps an eye out for promising young halflings similar to herself as a child, so that she might pass on her advice and training. Though much of her knowledge is loudly proclaimed to be a "trade secret," she has often been known to boast of its central maxim: "Hit first, hit hard, and don't stop till you're painted red."

Combat Encounters: Lylin is proud, but also a selfish and opportunistic combatant who is quick to turn on allies when her own life is on the line. Though an assassin and mercenary by trade-one who might easily be hired by any villain and sent against the PCs-Lylin disdains anonymity, and would prefer to finish her kills in public (though she isn't averse to starting with a sneak attack from the shadows).

Roleplaying Suggestions: Lylin's master taught her social graces, but even when diplomatic and pleasant, she is always sizing up potential opponents, and feels no qualms about taking life at the slightest provocation. She is far more likely to ally with a party that contains other halflings, though those who rely too much on racial camaraderie may be surprised by how quickly her backslapping friendship disappears if they dare question her methods.
