Description

This elixir forces the drinker to say nothing but the truth for 10
minutes (Will DC 13 negates). She must answer any questions
put to her in that time, but with each question she can make
a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is
successful, she doesn't break free of the truth-compelling
enchantment but also doesn't have to answer that particular
question (if she does answer, she must tell the truth). No more
than one question can be asked each round. This is a mindaffecting
compulsion enchantment.
