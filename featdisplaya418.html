Brutal Coup de Grace (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures">Horror Adventures pg. 83</a>
Your killing blows are so brutal that they scare other foes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a>, base attack bonus +5, proficiency with the selected weapon.

Benefit: When you deliver a coup de grace with the selected weapon and kill the target, enemies within 30 feet of you who can see or hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma bonus) or become shaken. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
