Karuth Firesoul

Karuth Firewalker is a truly inspired fire druid-and he is quite possibly insane. A few years ago, a fateful encounter with a prophetic elder fire elemental gave Karuth the impression that, unlike other humans, he has no soul. Rather, inside him rages a core of elemental fire-a fire that must be released, thus conveniently justifying his pyromaniac urges.

Combat Encounters: Karuth attacks with no warning, laughing maniacally as he burns alive any whom he encounters.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Although Karuth is evil, he occasionally suffers from periods of strange lucidity and regret. During these times he tearfully asking those who seem like they have a chance of standing against his fearful might to grant him release from his evil compulsions through death.
