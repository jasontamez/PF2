Description

A bastion shield grants its wielder the ability to shrug off mind-affecting effects for a limited time. Whenever the wielder of a bastion shield fails a Will saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, the shield suppresses this effect for a number of rounds equal to its enhancement bonus. During this time, the bastion shield loses its enhancement bonus. If the wearer of a bastion shield drops or loses it, any suppressed mind-affecting effect immediately takes effect. The bastion special ability can be applied only to heavy shields and tower shields.
