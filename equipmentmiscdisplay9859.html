Gather DC 18; Yield 1 dose
Terrain temperate or warm forests or plains
Preparation The amaranth's flowers and stalks must be carefully ground into paste. This requires a successful DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check and 1 hour of work.
Use A dose of black amaranth paste can be applied to a dead body to slow decay. One dose used on a Tiny or smaller creature delays the onset of decay for 3 days (as per gentle repose). Two doses are needed for Small creatures, 3 for Medium creatures, 6 for Large creatures, 12 for Huge creatures, 24 for Gargantuan creatures, and 48 for Colossal creatures. Each dose applied requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Description

Black amaranth grows in small clusters from the remains of the dead.
