Description

Several alterations along the edges of this well-maintained leather saddle allow for the movement of a mount's wings. A Sable Company elite saddle grants a mount wearing it a +5 competence bonus on Fly checks, and grants the rider a +5 competence bonus on Ride checks. If the rider is unsaddled during flight, he is immediately subject to a feather fall effect.

The mount additionally gains the benefits of any teamwork feats the rider possesses.
