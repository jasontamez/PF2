The PCs receive an XP reward when engaging a nemesis's stratagem, regardless of whether they emerge victorious. When the PCs gain this XP is up to you. It may make sense to award this XP at the end of an encounter, whether it's a single combat or interaction with the nemesis's agents, or it might come at the end of a larger adventure influenced by the strategem's benefits or theme. The PCs do not gain the XP if they avoid or ignore the stratagem. This XP reward is in addition to any XP the PCs receive for overcoming encounters as the stratagem plays out. Stratagem XP rewards are relative to the PCs' Average Party Level. After engaging a nemesis's strategem, the PCs should never receive less than the amount they-d receive for defeating a CR 1 encounter.

Low: The PCs gain XP as if they had defeated an encounter with a CR equal to their APL - 3.

Medium: The PCs gain XP as if they had defeated an encounter with a CR equal to their APL - 2.

High: The PCs gain XP as if they had defeated an encounter with a CR equal to their APL - 1.
