Some druids believe that birth and death are the most important parts of the natural cycle. They focus on destroying undead and putting troubled souls to rest.

Phantom: A death druid attracts phantoms like a spiritualist (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 72), though she focuses her efforts on putting those phantoms to rest. A death druid is continually attempting to figure out how to send her phantom to the afterlife (usually by completing the phantom's unfinished business as determined by the GM). If she is able to do so, she gains a new phantom with no additional effort on her part, sometime during the next week. At 1st level, she gains the spiritualist's phantom and etheric tether class features; at 4th level, she gains the bonded manifestation class feature; and at 14th level, she gains the spiritual bond class feature. She does not gain any of the other spiritualist abilities related to phantoms. The death druid treats her druid level as her spiritualist level for these abilities.

This ability replaces nature bond and wild shape.

Soul Magic: A death druid adds the following spells to her druid spell list at the given spell levels: 0-grave words; 1st-sanctify corpse; 2nd-calm spirit, false life, ghostbane dirge, spiritual weapon; 3rd-speak with dead; 4th-speak with haunt, spiritual ally; 5th-breath of life, call spirit, mass ghostbane dirge; 6th-circle of death, undeath to death.

This ability replaces nature sense and wild empathy.

Resist Death's Call (Ex): At 4th level, a death druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, negative energy, and energy drain.

This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Negative Immunity (Su): At 9th level, a death druid is immune to negative energy and energy drain.

This ability replaces venom immunity.
