Description

Pits, fissures, and errant magic might unexpectedly drop a traveler into underground tunnels. This backpack contains a variety of tools to survive an accidental subterranean expedition, including chalk, a climber's kit, a compass, a grappling hook, a hammer, 5 pitons, 100 feet of silk rope, and an everburning torch. The kit also contains a potion of darkvision in the event light would draw unwanted attention. Since oozes are a common underground hazard, the kit also includes 2 alkali flasks and a dose of bladeguard. Finally, a guidebook provides helpful information about underground flora and fauna, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures encountered in that terrain.
