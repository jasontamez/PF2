Special Abilities

Sadistic Strike (Su) Cambions excel at causing pain and anguish. Cambions always treat any weapons with which they attack (including natural weapons and spells with attack rolls) as if they had the Improved Critical feat for the weapons.

Sinfrenzy (Su) Every cambion carries an excessive capacity for one of the seven classical sins, determined at the moment of the cambion's birth and depending on the nature of his humanoid parent's greatest sin. Once per day for a number of rounds equal to his Hit Dice, a cambion can embrace his sin and enter a frenzied state as a free action. While a cambion is in this frenzy, his land speed increases by 10 feet and he gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and attack rolls. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by haste or similar effects, but if the cambion has at least 1 level in the class listed for his specific sin, the sinfrenzy grants an additional effect.

Envy (cleric): Cambion clerics covet the gods' power. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their channel energy effect increases by 1d6.

Gluttony (alchemist): Cambion alchemists enjoy drinking extracts, potions, mutagens, and even poisons. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their bombs deal an additional die of damage.

Greed (rogue): Cambion rogues are obsessed with gathering wealth and power. When they are in a sinfrenzy, cambion rogues deal an additional die of sneak attack damage.

Lust (bard): Cambion bards seek to dominate and control others, turning them into slaves. When cambion bards are in a sinfrenzy, the bonuses granted by their inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics abilities increase by 1. The save DCs of their bardic performances also increase by 1.

Pride (wizard): Cambion wizards believe their magic is the greatest. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their spell save DCs increase by 1.

Sloth (fighter): Cambion fighters bleed slowly. When entering a sinfrenzy, they gain 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die that disappear when the sinfrenzy ends.

Wrath (ranger): Cambion rangers attack with savage hatred. When they are in a sinfrenzy, their favored enemy bonuses increase by 2.

Description

When an incubus procreates with a humanoid in the Abyss, and the mortal parent resides on that plane throughout the pregnancy, the gestating child absorbs enough Abyssal energy to be born not as a half-demon, but as a type of humanoid demon known as a cambion.

Cambions are true outsiders. The majority of cambions have red skin, horns on their heads, and cloven hooves for feet-the fiendish aspects of cambions' appearance don't range as widely as those of tieflings. A typical cambion stands 6 feet tall and weighs 190 pounds.

Demons exist for one reason-to destroy. Where their more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape them into reflections of their own evil, demons seek only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy-for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon's depredations and flee to his just reward in the afterlife. It is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels a demon's lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.

Demons are the most prolific and among the most destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across the multiverse as the Abyss. Before the first fledgling deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully formed, the Abyss was infested with life.

Known to many scholars as "proto-demons," these wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, because of the influence of sinful mortal souls upon the Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the daemonic keepers of Abaddon and the cruel whims of fate and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the demonic hordes grows-a single soul can fuel the manifestation of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes and roles of the newly formed fiends.

The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the Maelstrom itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. Some flop on land while others flap in air or sea. Some are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work to the same goal-pain and suffering for mortal life in all its forms.

Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most demons find ways to twist their summoners' demands so that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks free of his control.

The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic sires to gift them with horrific children are common enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in support of that which would bring destruction to all.
