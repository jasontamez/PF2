Aether (Elemental School)

Aether is a strange and complex substance that occurs where the Elemental Planes touch the Ethereal Plane. Wizards who study aether use it to manipulate objects on the Material Plane. The aether elemental school is an elemental arcane school a wizard can specialize in instead of one of the standard schools of magic.

Like a normal arcane school, the aether elemental school grants a number of school powers, as well as one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the aether elemental school's spell list (see below). Unlike a normal arcane school, the aether elemental school requires the wizard to select a single element as his opposition school (air, earth, fire, or water, from pages 142-143 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide, for example). The wizard does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.

Aether Magic: Add the following spells to your wizard spell list at the listed spell level: 0-telekinetic projectile, 2nd-spiritual weapon, 4th-spiritual ally, 5th-ethereal envelope, 6th-animate objects, 7th-ectoplasmic eruption, 9th-telekinetic storm.

Aether Supremacy (Su): You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Sleight of Hand checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 wizard levels you have. In addition, you can cast mage hand at will as a spell-like ability that uses your caster level. At 5th level, you can attempt Sleight of Hand checks against a target within 30 feet, though the skill check DC increases by 5, and any creature within line of sight of either you or the target can attempt an opposed Perception check to notice the attempt. At 10th level, you can attempt a Sleight of Hand check as a move action with only a -10 penalty. At 20th level, whenever you attempt a Sleight of Hand check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

Telekinetic Protection (Su): As a swift action, you can grant yourself protection against nonmagical attacks by forming a field to telekinetically deflect them. You gain DR 5/magic for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Receptive Vibrations (Su): At 8th level, you are constantly surrounded by ephemeral and invisible strands of aether, increasing your awareness of your surroundings. You are never denied your Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks made within 30 feet of you because you are flat-footed or because your assailant is unseen. In addition, you gain a bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised equal to half your wizard level.
