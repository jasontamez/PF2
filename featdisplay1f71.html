You become an expert of hiding in plain sight.

Prerequisites: Stealth 5 ranks, <a href="racesdisplay6f1b.html?ItemName=Wyrwood">wyrwood</a>.

Benefit: You gain the <a href="umrb0cc.html?ItemName=Freeze">freeze</a> universal monster rule, allowing you to appear as an ordinary statue. If you attack a creature unaware of you while using this ability, you double your critical threat range. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of your attacks or weapons.
