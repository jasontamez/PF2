You feed off the rage of your allies.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, rage class feature.

Benefit:  When you are in a rage and an ally with this feat within 60 feet is in a rage, you don't take the normal -2 penalty to AC for being in a rage. If you would take a larger penalty to AC for being in a rage, reduce that penalty by 2.
