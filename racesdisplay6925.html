Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless artisans of the earth. It could be said that their history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors. ??

Dwarves are lovers of history and tradition, and their long lifespan leads to far less in the way of generational shifts in attitudes, styles, fashions, and trends than shorter-lived races exhibit. If a thing is not broken, they do not fix it or change it; and if it is broken, they fix it rather than replace it. Thrifty as a rule, dwarves are loath to discard anything unless it is truly ruined and unable to be fixed. At the same time, dwarves' meticulous, near-obsessive attention to detail and durability in their craftsmanship makes that a rare occurrence, as the things they make are built to last. As a result, buildings, artwork, tools, housewares, garments, weapons, and virtually everything else made by dwarves still sees regular use at an age when such items would be relegated to museum pieces, dusty antique shelves, or junkyard fodder by other races. Taken together, these traits create the impression that dwarves are a race frozen in time. ??

Nothing could be further from the truth, however, as dwarves are both thoughtful and imaginative, willing to experiment, if always keen to refine and perfect a new technique or product before moving on to the next one. Dwarves have achieved feats of metallurgy, stonework, and engineering that have consistently outpaced the technological advances of other races, though some non-dwarven races have used magic to supplement and perfect their own creations to achieve the same ends through mystical rather than mundane means. They are also a race typified by stubborn courage and dedication to seeing tasks through to completion, whatever the risks. These traits have led dwarves to explore and settle in extreme environments that would cause other races to quail and retreat. From the darkest depths of the underworld to the highest mountain peaks, from rusting iron citadels along desolate rocky coasts to squat jungle ziggurats, dwarves have established their enclaves and redoubts, holding them against all comers or perishing to the last and leaving only their enduring monuments to stand as their legacy. ??

While it is said that dwarves are not venturesome or inventive, it would be more accurate to say that they maintain a focus on and dedication to each task they undertake and every change they adopt, vetting such changes thoroughly before adopting them wholeheartedly. When faced with new circumstances and new needs, they react by applying tried and true tools and techniques systematically, using existing methods whenever possible rather than trying to invent novel solutions for every situation. If necessity requires, however, they throw themselves with equal vigor into developing the next perfect procedure for demolishing the obstacles that get in their way. Once their desired goal is obtained, they focus on consolidating each new piece of territory or conceptual advance. Dwarves thus rarely overextend themselves, but they also may miss opportunities to seize the initiative and maximize the advantages they create. ??

Physical Description: Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse-no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven man. ??

Society: The great distances between dwarves' mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves, such as those areas where these races are uncommon or unheard of, dwarves' fixation on security and safety combined with their rather pugnacious nature leads them to find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not precisely militaristic, they learned long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus dwarves everywhere are schooled to be ready to enforce their rights and claims by force of arms. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves do not hesitate to adopt what they call "aggressive negotiations." ??

Relations: Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another, and share a history of violence as old as both races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find elves, gnomes, and halflings to be too frail, flighty, or "pretty" to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans' industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal. ??

Alignment and Religion: Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work hard, they play even harder-especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good. ??

Adventurers: Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians. ??

Males Names: Dolgrin, Grunyar, Harsk, Kazmuk, Morgrym, Rogar. ??

Female Names: Agna, Bodill, Ingra, Kotri, Rusilka, Yangrit.

Desert Dwarves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 4</a>
In southern peaks of the Shattered Range, near Geb and the Screaming Jungle, clans of nomadic dwarves live and travel through ancient tunnels by day, moving to the surface only at night. Though there are no known dwarven cities in this region, the Garundi dwarves claim the extensive tunnels and caverns they move through are the remains of a once=powerful dwarven kingdom, which was struck down by the gods for some long-forgotten offense. These dwarves travel in caravans of 40 or so family units (though the largest caravans can contain more than 300 families) and engage in sporadic clan-based trade or warfare, but they all respect the neutrality of hidden settlements of dwarves who dwell in underground oases within the mountains. Desert dwarves often have the craftsman, mountaineer, and rock stepper alternate racial traits. Most also have the desert delver alternate racial trait described below.



Elder Dwarf

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 12</a>

Dwarves living atop high peaks have the mountaineer racial trait and often surface survivalist as well. Mountain dwarves are also trained to defend their homes, and may take the sky sentinel and xenophobic traits instead.



Mwangi Dwarves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 4</a>
Two tribes of dwarves reside in the Mwangi Expanse: the Mbe-ke and the Taralu. The Mbe-ke build cities in the mountains of the Terwa Uplands, while the Taralu live in small clans in the eastern jungle. Although there is little contact between the two groups, they share a reverence for and affinity with dragons-most especially cloud dragons' as well as any draconic creature that can be reasoned with, including wyverns. Mwangi dwarves often take the magic resistant or surface survivalist alternate racial traits. Those who form the strongest spiritual bonds to some form of dragon sometimes also have the breath weapon alternate racial trait described below.



Ouat Caste Dwarves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 4</a>
The Ouat caste dwarves are a sect of the Pahmet dwarves of Osirion who pursue self-perfection in the style of Irori. Ouat caste dwarves seek to become closer to divinity by overcoming their mortal limitations. They train themselves and others in the monastic city of Tar Kuata, constantly striving to put aside petty material concerns to focus on spiritual growth. The Ouat's focus on the power of will and self-improvement causes many of them to take the relentless and stubborn alternate racial traits. Those who begin the path to inner awareness very early in their lives also sometimes take the iron within alternate racial trait described below.



Pahmet Dwarves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 5</a>
The Pahmet have been present in Osirion since ancient days and claim to have been sent by the gods to warn the pharaohs of impending crises and disasters. Though most scholars suspect that claim is more legend than history, the ancient pharaohs of Osirion treated the Pahmet with great reverence. In return, the Pahmet guard Erekrus, a necropolis in the mountains of southern Osirion, where the Pahmet interred the bodies of pharaohs deemed particularly worthy. The Pahmet are a rigid and often mistrusting people; it is common for its members who avoid contact with outsiders to have the xenophobic alternate racial trait. Many Pahmet have the lorekeeper, mountaineer, rock stepper, and surface survivalist alternate racial traits. Those who come from long lines of keepers who dedicate themselves to the guarding of tombs also often have the death's end alternate racial trait described below.



Paraheen Dwarves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 5</a>
The Paraheen are a small but important part of the society of Katheer, where they operate numerous forges and weapon shops within the city. Not quite a clan, the Paraheen are a set of related, family-run businesses respected for their great craftsmanship and work ethic. While most Paraheen are not citizens of Qadira, they are treated as a valued subclass of residents, with enough powerful patrons among the upper ranks of Qadiran society to afford them protection that in some cases is greater than citizenship. The Paraheen have operated as an autonomous community for centuries, avoiding local politics and worshiping a combination of traditional dwarven gods and an aspect of Sarenrae who is aligned with the fire of the forge. Nearly all Paraheen have the craftsman alternate racial trait, but in the case of the Paraheen, it replaces hardy rather than greed. Those Paraheen who are involved in trade by river and sea, common in Katheer, also generally have the saltbeard alternate racial trait. Most Paraheen from older families tend to have the iron citizen alternate racial trait described below.



Sky Citadel Dwarves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 5</a>
When the dwarves successfully completed the Quest for Sky, they set about constructing 10 Sky Citadels, massive fortresses that formed the basis for dwarven kingdoms in the Inner Sea region. While several of those Sky Citadels have been lost or overrun, a few'such as Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Dongun Hold-remain bastions of dwarven tradition and authority. Because these Sky Citadels often have connections to the Darklands, it is common for the dwarves dwelling in their lower reaches to have the ancient enmity or deep warrior alternate racial traits, while those in lands populated by ogres and hill giants often have the giant hunter alternate racial trait, and those in wealthy areas that attract the attention of dragons sometimes have the sky sentinel or wyrmscourged alternate racial traits. Because of the eon-long histories of the Sky Citadels, their citizens also often have the deep tradition alternate racial trait described below.



Dwarf Alternate Racial Trait

Replaces Darkvision

Low-Light Vision
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9cro?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Wild">Heroes of the Wild pg. 5</a>
Many feyborn have low-light vision. Races that normally have darkvision (such as dwarves and half-orcs) can take low-light vision in place of darkvision. In the case of humans, this trait replaces the skilled trait (and the human also gains fey magic and fey thoughts, as detailed in Fey Magic, above).

Minesight
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 12</a>
Dwarves with this racial trait increase the range of their darkvision to 90 feet; however, they are automatically dazzled in bright light and take a -2 penalty on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor. This racial trait replaces darkvision.

Surface Survivalist
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 12</a>
Some dwarves have dwelt so long aboveground they have lost their ability to see at night. However, their adaptation to extreme environments allows them to treat wind conditions (when determining whether or not they are checked or blown away) and either hot or cold climates (choose one) as one step less severe. This racial trait replaces darkvision.


Replaces Darkvision, Hatred

Dusksight
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 4</a>
Characters who operate below canopies or fight in dimly lit caves and shadowy planes of existence learn to use their low-light vision to deduce a foe's position from the flickers of shadows around a target. When making ranged attacks, characters with this trait can reroll the miss chance granted by cover to any target in dim light, and take the better of the two rolls. The miss chance for total concealment applies normally.

Dwarves can take this trait in place of hatred and darkvision, also gaining low-light vision. Elves, gnomes, half-elves, and halflings can take this trait in place of keen senses. Half-orcs can take this trait in place of weapon familiarity, also gaining low-light vision.


Replaces Defensive Training

This replaces defensive training.


Replaces Defensive Training, Hardy

Poison Minion
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 5</a>
Drow sometimes augment their slaves and frontline warriors by making them toxic, causing their bodies to internally produce mawbane poison (see below). The resulting poisonous creature makes a potent weapon in the effort to discourage neighboring monsters. Any creature that hits such a character with a bite attack is immediately exposed to its poison. The save DC for this poison is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's Hit Dice + the character's Constitution modifier.

Mawbane Poison-ingested; save Fortitude as above; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 1 save.

Dwarves can take this trait in place of defensive training and hardy. Elves can take this trait in place of elven magic and weapon familiarity. Gnomes can take this trait in place of defensive training, gnome magic, and illusion resistance. Half-elves can take this trait in place of elven immunities and keen senses. Half-orcs can take this trait in place of orc ferocity and weapon familiarity. Humans can take this trait in place of skilled. Halfling physiology prevents them from taking this trait.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 5</a>
While some dwarves focus their early years on training against one specific foe of the dwarven kingdoms, others know that there are many enemies who would destroy dwarvenkind if given the opportunity. A dwarf with this racial trait gains a +1 bonus on melee attack rolls and a +1 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity made by drow, duergar, creatures of the aberration type, or creatures of the giant or orc subtype.

Dwarves with this racial trait gain 1 ki point. If the dwarf gains ki points from a different source, this ki point is added to that pool. In addition to any other ways in which the dwarf can use ki, the dwarf can expend the ki point as a swift action to either gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round or increase her base speed by 20 feet for 1 round. The bonus ki point does not allow the dwarf to make a ki strike unless she has another ability that allows her to do so, such as the ki pool from the monk class. Like other ki points, this ki point is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation.

This replaces defensive training and hatred.
