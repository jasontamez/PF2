Deities: Abadar.

Inspiring Word (minor): At 1st level, you can speak a few words to a creature within 30 feet that fill them with inspiration. You can grant that creature a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, or saving throws (your choice). This effect lasts for 1 minute.

Lead by Example (major): At 10th level, as a swift action you can inspire your allies to follow your lead. If the following action on your turn is an attack or skill check, all allies within 30 feet who take the same action against the same foe or obstacle on their next turn gain a +4 morale bonus on that roll.

Associated Blessing: Nobility

Replacement Blessing: The following major blessing replaces the lead by example ability of the Nobility blessing.

Martyr's Sacrifice (Major): At 10th level, your body can accept wounds meant for others you deem worthy. You can shoulder the wounds of an ally within 50 feet for 1 minute, and during this time, the ally is affected as if you had cast shield other on her (except with a range of 50 feet). You can have only one use of this ability active at a time; if you use this major blessing again, the previous use immediately expires.
