Effect This plant's pollen contains a powerful hallucinogen that causes affected creatures to experience terribly realistic visions of death and destruction.

When the target succeeds at her saving throw against the poison, or when the initial duration ends, she is shaken for an additional 1d4 rounds. (This is not a fear effect.)
