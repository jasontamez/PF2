Description

Install DC 38; Implantation 4

The Arms of the Iron God replace the arms, shoulders, and much of the recipient's spine. They double the creature's lifting and carrying capacity, grant a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks, and grant a +5 bonus to CMD against disarm attempts. The Arms also grant the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength.

Each arm ends in an electrified claw that grants the wielder a claw attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. These claw attacks are always primary attacks, even while a one-handed weapon is wielded and the other claw is used to make an additional attack. The claws function as +3 shocking burst weapons. As a free action, one of the claws can be transformed into a +3 shocking burst battleaxe-returning it to its claw form is a move action. When the claw transforms, any item held in or worn on that hand drops. Attacks made with this battleaxe gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls, but it cannot be wielded with two hands.

The Arms also function as a divine focus for spellcasting if the user worships Unity-even for unusually expensive divine focuses, such as the focus needed for destruction.

Destruction

Once Unity is destroyed, the Arms of the Iron God can be destroyed as a normal item (hardness 15, hp 120).
