Description

These short black shoes fit tightly around the wearer's
feet and bear designs of leaping arcs of lightning and wild
winds. Once per day on command, a creature wearing these
boots can transform into lightning and move up to 50 feet
in a straight line, re-materializing at the far end of the
lightning bolt. Creatures in the path of the lightning take
6d6 points of electricity damage and objects take damage
as per the lightning bolt spell. If the lightning strikes an
object or barrier and fails to burst through it, the creature
wearing the boots appears next to the impacted object and
is staggered for 1 round. Movement while in lightning form
does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
