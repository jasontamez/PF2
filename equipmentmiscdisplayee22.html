Description

This hardened mixture of animal marrow and minerals is shaped into a long bone. When chewed upon by a creature for no fewer than 15 minutes, a whet bone grants the creature a +1 bonus on its next damage roll the first time it hits with a bite attack. This only works on nonmagical bite attacks.
