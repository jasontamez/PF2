Description

This cylindrical puzzle has eight faces and a dozen rings along its length that can be spun individually, each with different numbers on each face. The user of a numerology cylinder can twist and turn these rings into a multitude of combinations. As a full-round action, the user can try to find a new combination with particular numeric significance by attempting a DC 25 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Intelligence check. If she finds one, she gains a +2 insight bonus on caster level checks (such as to overcome spell resistance) for 24 hours. On a failed check, the faces lock and the cylinder can't be used again for 24 hours.
