Description

Common across the length and breadth of Golarion, secure sheaths take a hundred different forms, from simple loops to richly engraved scabbards. A secure sheath can be attuned to a new owner by that character wearing it continuously for 24 hours. If anyone other than the owner attempts to draw a weapon from a secure sheath, he finds that the weapon is stuck and must succeed at a DC 20 Strength check to pull it out.
