Shaitan Earthblast - Feats







Shaitan Earthblast (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 117</a>
With a forceful stomp you release a blast of acid from the earth to burn your enemies.

Prerequisites: Con 15, Wis 17, <a href="featdisplay1029.html?ItemName=Elemental%20Fist">Elemental Fist</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplayc17c.html?ItemName=Shaitan%20Skin">Shaitan Skin</a>, <a href="featdisplaya045.html?ItemName=Shaitan%20Style">Shaitan Style</a>, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th.

Benefit:  While using the Shaitan Style feat, as a standard action, you can spend two Elemental Fist (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 20-foot column of acid that has a 5-foot radius and erupts from a point of origin within 30 feet of you. Creatures caught in the column take your unarmed strike damage plus the acid damage from your Elemental Fist and are staggered for 1 round. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being staggered.

Instead of spending two uses of Elemental Fist to unleash a column of acid, you can spend one use of Elemental Fist and 2 stamina points.
