Description

A deceptive weapon's shape blurs and appears to bend
unpredictably. When the weapon is in hand, the wielder gains a
bonus on Bluff checks to feint equal to the enhancement bonus
of the weapon. In addition, when the wielder successfully
confirms a critical hit with a deceptive weapon against an
opponent, she can attempt to feint against that opponent as an
immediate action.
