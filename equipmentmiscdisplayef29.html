Description

Obals are small silver or gold coins that are embossed with a holy symbol and blessed by a priest of a god of war or death. Inquisitors and warpriests traditionally place the coins on the corpses of those slain in battle, usually one over each eye or one in the mouth. The cost is for a batch of 12 obals.
