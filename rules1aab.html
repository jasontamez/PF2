Uniquely beautiful in appearance, vampire orchids grow in large clusters in meadows or on hilltops where they can get plenty of sunlight. Their vivid petals range in a hue of wild and clashing colors with frequent splotches of crimson on the petals. Vampire orchids can be exceedingly dangerous to the unwary due to their unusual pollination methods. A creature traveling through a cluster of vampire orchids must attempt a DC 15 Reflex save or a DC 20 Acrobatics check. Failure causes the tremors from the creature's footsteps to release soporific pollen from the orchids' blossoms, forcing the creature to attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid falling asleep for 1 minute. A helpless or sleeping creature takes 1d4 points of damage at the end of each round it remains in contact with vampire orchids' this damage does not cause physical pain and is not in and of itself enough to wake a sleeping creature.
