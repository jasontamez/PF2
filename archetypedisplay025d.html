Seal-breakers are dedicated to the Whispering Tyrant and have tasked themselves with finding and destroying the seals that bind him within Gallowspire. Their ties to the Whispering Tyrant give them power over undead creatures and other dark forces.

Aura of the Grave (Su):  At 3rd level, a seal-breaker is constantly surrounded by the chill of death. Mindless undead within 10 feet of the seal-breaker will not attack him unless directly ordered to, and even then only after succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10  1/2 the seal-breaker's level  his Charisma modifier). This ability replaces aura of cowardice.

Corpse Rider (Su):  Upon reaching 5th level, a sealbreaker receives a boon from beyond the grave. This boon can take one of two forms: the seal-breaker can choose to form a bond with his weapon, or he can choose to animate an undead mount to ride.

If a bonded weapon is selected, this ability works exactly like the antipaladin's fiendish boon ability.

If the undead mount ability is selected, the sealbreaker gains the ability to reanimate any Large corpse (or a Medium corpse for Small seal-breakers) as his corpse mount. If no such corpse is present, the seal-breaker cannot summon his mount. The corpse animates as a quadruped of the same size that the seal-breaker can ride, regardless of the corpse's living form. This corpse mount functions as a <a href="classdisplay4c10.html?ItemName=Companion">druid's animal companion</a> using the seal-breaker's level as his effective druid level. The mount has the same base statistics as a heavy horse, pony, boar, camel, or dog (based on its size) with the following changes: its type changes to undead, it has a good Will save and bad Fortitude and Reflex saves, it uses the base creature's Constitution score as its Charisma score (and likewise applies all level-based advancements to Charisma instead of Constitution), and it has an Intelligence score of at least 6. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces fiendish boon.

Aura of Death (Su):  At 8th level, a seal-breaker radiates an aura that causes undead creatures within 10 feet to gain a  profane bonus on all saving throws. This ability replaces aura of despair.

Aura of Rebirth (Su):  At 11th level, if a living creature is slain within 10 feet of the seal-breaker, the seal-breaker can spend two uses of his smite good ability at the start of his next turn as a standard action to summon the spirit of a dead murderer to reanimate the corpse as a mohrg. The mohrg immediately rises and attacks the seal breaker's foes, acting under the antipaladin's command. After 1 minute, the murderer's soul leaves the body, which collapses, again lifeless. At 15th level, the seal-breaker can activate this ability as a move action. At 19th level, he can activate this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.

Code of Conduct:  The seal-breaker is dedicated to releasing the Whispering Tyrant from his prison. If a sealbreaker willingly and altruistically commits a good act, he loses all class features except proficiencies. This doesn't mean that a seal-breaker can't take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always lead toward the eventual release of the Whispering Tyrant. A seal-breaker's code requires that he place the ultimate release of Tar-Baphon above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just (provided such actions don't interfere with his ultimate goal).
