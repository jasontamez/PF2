Description

Katapeshi slave masters and enforcers sometimes use slaver's canes to put down insubordinates or recapture escaped property. The head of the studded black +1 adamantine light mace sports numerous cruel spikes, and a series of chains around the grip of the mace make it difficult to wrench from the wielder's hands (granting the wielder a +4 bonus to CMD versus attempts to disarm the weapon). In addition, the command word of the slaver's cane can be spoken once per day to create a 10-foot-radius resilient sphere around a target within 90 feet (Reflex DC 16 negates) that lasts for 10 minutes.
