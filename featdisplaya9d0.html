You can charm people into lowering their defenses, allowing you to ambush them more effectively.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>, <a href="featdisplaye71e.html?ItemName=Persuasive">Persuasive</a>, base attack bonus +3.

Benefit:  When you succeed at a Diplomacy check to change a creature's attitude, you can draw a weapon and make a single melee attack against that creature as an immediate action. If you changed your target's attitude to friendly or better, your target is considered flat-footed against this attack. If the target survives, it takes a -2 penalty on its initiative check for this combat.

Once you attack a creature, its attitude becomes hostile.
