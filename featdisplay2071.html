You can create construct creatures like golems.

Prerequisites: Caster level 5th, <a href="featdisplay9939.html?ItemName=Craft%20Magic%20Arms%20and%20Armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, <a href="featdisplay7f69.html?ItemName=Craft%20Wondrous%20Item">Craft Wondrous Item.</a>

Benefit:  You can create any construct whose prerequisites you meet. The act of animating a construct takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its market price. To create a construct, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price, plus the full cost of the basic body created for the construct. Each construct has a special section that summarizes its costs and other prerequisites. A newly created construct has average hit points for its Hit Dice.
