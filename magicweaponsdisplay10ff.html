Description

This two-handed melee shadowcraft weapon is extremely ductile, and it easily bends and stretches without hampering its ability to harm opponents. On command, a lashing shadowcraft weapon can be extended as a swift action, increasing the weapon's reach by 5 feet for 1 round. While extended, the wielder does not threaten adjacent creatures, or creatures up to 10 feet away if the weapon already has reach.
