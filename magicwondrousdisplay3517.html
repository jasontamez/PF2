Description

This band of raggedly stitched animal skins and teeth focuses a
barbarian wearer's bloodlust. When the wearer enters a rage,
she selects one of her rage powers. For the duration of the
rage, that power functions as if the wearer's barbarian level
were four levels higher.


Once per day when the wearer is attacked or has to make
a saving throw against a hostile effect, she may spend
2 rounds of rage to begin a rage as an immediate action.
This rage becomes active prior to resolving the attack that
triggered it and lasts until the start of her next turn (at which
time she may continue to rage as if she had begun the rage
in the normal manner).
