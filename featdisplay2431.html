You can fly through the air at high speed, creating a column of wind in your path that destabilizes other fliers.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayd2f6.html?ItemName=Turbulent%20Takeoff">Turbulent Takeoff</a>, Fly 10 ranks.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can fly up to twice your Fly speed in a straight line, creating a shockwave of rushing winds around you as you move. Each flying creature you pass adjacent to as part of this movement must succeed at a DC 25 Fly check or be blown back 1d6??10 feet and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting. Creatures that fail this check by 5 or more also lose 1d4??10 feet of altitude, and creatures that fail this check by 10 or more plummet to the ground.
