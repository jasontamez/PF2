You know that you are far better than average creatures of your kind. The more you leverage your psychic talents to prove yourself superior, the more powerful you become.

Discipline Powers: Your unflappable sense of self-worth grants you powers that your rivals can't hope to countermand.

Self-Assurance (Su): Overwhelming confidence in your success brings you closer to your goals, and you know that your superiority has destined you for greatness. As an immediate action, you can gain a morale bonus equal to half your psychic level (minimum 1) on a single ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. You must declare that you are using this ability before attempting the roll in question. If you succeed at the check, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.

At Arm's Length (Ex): At 5th level, you gain Reach Spell as a bonus feat. Additionally, when using this feat, you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool for each increase in the spell's range category. If you do, the spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than normal. (For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range via this feat would normally use up a spell slot 3 levels higher, but if you spend 3 points from your phrenic pool, the spell does not use up a higher spell slot.)

Magical Hoarder (Su): At 13th level, whenever a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell intended to benefit its targets, you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool as an immediate action to include yourself as a target of that spell. If the creature is not your ally, you must be able to clearly see the spell's effects and you must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the spell's level) to identify the spell before using this ability. If you are not within the normal range of the spell, then you must spend 1 additional point from your phrenic pool to use this ability. If the spell has a range of personal, then you must instead spend 2 additional phrenic points from your pool to use this ability. This ability does not affect spells with an instantaneous or permanent duration.
