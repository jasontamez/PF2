Description

This pewter chain necklace is formed from alternating sizes of metal links, creating a delicate but imposing look. Short enough to be a choker, it is set in the middle with a brilliant jasper stone that is finely cut and shines even when light is scarce. Whenever the wearer fails a saving throw against an effect that results in paralysis, the periapt instead causes the wearer to be fatigued for 1d4 rounds. If an effect would paralyze the wearer without a saving throw, he is instead fatigued until he removes the condition. If the wearer fails a saving throw against a paralyzing effect while fatigued, he becomes exhausted. Characters with the exhausted condition gain no benefits from a periapt of proof against paralysis.
