Crusader's Fist (Combat)

You pour divine energy into the enemy you strike.

Prerequisites: Lay on hands class feature or touch of corruption class feature, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  When you attack with an unarmed strike and hit a creature that you can harm with your lay on hands or touch of corruption feature, you can use a swift action to expend a daily use of that feature to deal its normal damage as if you had hit with the feature's normal touch attack. This extra damage is not multiplied if you scored a critical hit.

When you use Crusader's Fist and confirm a critical hit, you can spend 5 stamina points to multiply the extra damage for that critical hit.
