Description

A zipstick is a small pen-like device used to administer a small jolt of electricity. This jolt is enough to cause 1 point of nonlethal damage with a successful touch attack. A zipstick is used most often to activate or deactivate items that function on ion-bonding technology, such as ion tape (see page 48).
