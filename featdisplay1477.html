Meditation allows you to perceive time as if it were moving more slowly.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, <a href="featdisplayc271.html?ItemName=Combat%20Meditation">Combat Meditation</a>, <a href="featdisplayade4.html?ItemName=Meditation%20Master">Meditation Master</a>, character level 7th.

Benefit:  Once per day, when you meditate as a full-round action using the Combat Meditation feat, you gain the effects of haste for 1 round per 2 character levels. These effects do not stack with the haste spell, the speed magic weapon special ability, or other effects granting the same result. This is an extraordinary ability.
