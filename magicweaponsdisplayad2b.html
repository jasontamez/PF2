Description

This +1 dagger is forged for Daggermark assassins by Lady Smilos's orders alone. It allows slayers, rogues, and assassins who work for the Daggermark Assassins' Guild the chance to finish the job if their initial strikes prove less than successful. If the wielder of this blade studies his target for 3 rounds (which can be the same 3 rounds of study for a death attack) either unseen or without being recognized as an enemy, he can sneak attack with all attacks he makes with this dagger against that target for the next 3 rounds. If his target has improved uncanny dodge, the wielder of the Daggermark blade must be 4 levels higher than the target in order to sneak attack.
