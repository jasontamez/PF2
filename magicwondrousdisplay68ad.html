Description

This strange device appears to be a twisted rod crafted of some unknown alloy of metal and crystal. The device requires two hands to use. When activated, the mist projector discharges a 60-foot cone of supercooled mist. This functions as cone of cold, dealing 10d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in the area (DC 17 Reflex save for half ). Once fired, a cloud of mist persists in the area of effect for 1d10 minutes or until dispersed, functioning as a fog cloud. A mi-go mist projector normally contains 27 charges. A mist projector is impossible to recharge without mi-go technology.
