Even when your innate powers over light fail you, you and your allies prove vigilant against dark forces, fighting until the end.

Prerequisites: Aasimar, daylight spell-like ability.

Benefit:  Whenever you cast your daylight spell-like ability, you do so as if your caster level were one higher. Whenever an enemy successfully counters or dispels your daylight spell-like ability, you and any allies within a 20-foot radius gain darkvision 60 feet for a number of rounds equal to your character level. This is a supernatural effect.
