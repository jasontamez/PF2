Description

These boots appear and initially function as one of the other
kinds of magic boots. When the wearer is in (or fleeing from)
melee combat, boots of dancing impede movement, making
him behave as if irresistible dance had been cast upon him.
Only a remove curse spell enables the wearer to be rid of the
boots once their true nature is revealed.
