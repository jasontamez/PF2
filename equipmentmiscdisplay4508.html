Description

Once you imbibe this metallic-tasting liquid, its effects last for 1 hour. During this time, you can accept alchemical burn to increase your sneak attack damage by 1d6 points or your hidden strike damage by 1d4 or 1d8 points (as appropriate) for 1 round. If you don't possess the sneak attack or hidden strike abilities, imbibing this tonic has no effect.
