Description

This braid, crafted from strips of pugwampi pelts, is 1 inch in diameter and 12 inches long. It can be carried in the hand like a riding crop or worn as an adornment.

Once per day with a command word, the owner of the braid can create a 5-foot-radius aura around the braid for 1 minute. Creatures other than the owner within the aura must roll twice and use the lower result whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll. This is a mind-affecting effect that does not work on humanoids with the gnoll subtype, animals, or gremlins. A creature under the effect of a luck bonus is immune to the aura.
