You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. If you spend 5 stamina points, you can gain the feat's benefits when you and one other ally are threatening an opponent (instead of two other allies).
