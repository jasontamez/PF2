Description

This sword appears to be a +2 greatsword. However, whenever it
is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits
and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability). He attacks the
nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead
or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many
see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon.
