As a full-round action, a creature with the trample ability can attempt to overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself. This works just like the overrun combat maneuver, but the trampling creature does not need to attempt a check; it merely has to move over opponents in its path. Targets of a trample take an amount of damage equal to the trampling creature's slam damage + 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Targets of a trample can make an attack of opportunity, but at a -4 penalty. If a target forgoes an attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the trampling creature and take half damage. The save DC against a creature's trample attack is 10 + 1/2 the creature's HD + the creature's Strength modifier (the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text). A trampling creature can only deal its trampling damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. A trampling creature can move up to twice its land speed as part of the trample.
