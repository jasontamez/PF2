You can knock a foe away with your two-handed firearm.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms)</a>, gunslinger level 6th, pistol-whip deed.

Benefit: When you hit an opponent with a two-handed firearm while using the pistol-whip deed, you can perform a reposition combat maneuver instead of knocking the target prone. However, you can't reposition the foe closer to you. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
