Element void; Type utility (Sp); Level 4; Burn 0
Prerequisite emptiness
The power of void protects you from curses and allows you to remove or suppress them. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against curses and hexes. You can accept 1 point of burn as a standard action to attempt a caster level check to remove a curse on yourself or another as per remove curse. If the curse normally could not be removed by remove curse, you can instead suppress the curse until the next time your burn is removed with a successful caster level check. When your burn is removed, you can choose not to remove the burn you spent in this way to continue suppressing the curse without interruption. If you die, any curse suppressed in this way returns instantly.
