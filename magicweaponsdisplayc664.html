Description

This broad-bladed +1 ghost touch nine-ring broadsword (Ultimate Combat 131, or use longsword) is crafted of silvery-gray steel, with nine golden rings threaded through its spine that glow with magical power. Streamers of blue and purple silk hang from the sword's pommel.

The nine-fold spirit sword has 9 charges, represented by its nine rings. As a swift action, the wielder can discharge the energy in these rings to create one of three effects.

By expending 1 charge, the wielder can add the undead bane special ability to the sword for 1 minute.

By expending 2 charges, the wielder can attempt to banish a creature possessing another creature (such as a ghost possessing a creature with its malevolence ability) with a successful hit on the possessed creature. The possessing creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be driven out of the body of the creature it is possessing.

By expending 3 charges, the wielder can attempt to destroy a single undead creature with a successful hit. The creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be utterly destroyed. Spell resistance does not apply against either the banishing or destruction effect.

Each ring holds 1 charge; when a charge is expended, one ring stops glowing. The sword recharges 1 charge per week.
