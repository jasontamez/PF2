Description

This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough
to loop around the wearer's neck. A successful DC 12 Perform
(percussion) check activates the drum, which enhances any
nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer spends a
move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including
fire spells and effects) within 30 feet of the bearer deal an
additional 1 point of fire damage (or 2 points for the greater version).

All unattended flammable alchemical objects such as
tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist's fire, and fireworks within
this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or
exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates.
This chance increases by 5% each round and is checked at the
start of the performer's turn as long as the playing continues.

A greater goblin fire drum has all the above abilities and can
create pyrotechnics once per day.
