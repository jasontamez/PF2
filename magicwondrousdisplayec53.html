Description

The litheria blossom is a rare but naturally occurring flower with large, pink petals. The pollen of the litheria blossom bridges the gap between life and death, functioning like an elixir, though inhaled rather than imbibed. A creature inhaling the pollen gains the benefit of the death ward and deathwatch spells. Both effects last for 10 minutes. If plucked, the flower remains vibrant and alive until the pollen within the flower is inhaled, at which point the flower wilts and dies. The pollen remains potent only so long as it held within the flower or immediately thereafter. If removed from the flower for longer than 1 round, both the pollen and the flower become nonmagical.
