Panoplies


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qhr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Psychic-Anthology">Psychic Anthology</a>
While many occultists focus on the inherent psychic properties of certain types of objects, some specialists take their studies a step further, exploring the ways specific types of implements interact with one another. While not all implements psychically resonate with all other kinds of implements, such panoplies unlock even greater magical potential when used to complement one another.

An occultist can select a panoply anytime he selects a new implement school. To do so, he must already have learned to use the implement school of each implement within the panoply at least once. As with any other implement school, when an occultist learns to use a panoply, he gains access to the resonant power and base focus power, and he becomes able to learn the panoply's other focus powers. He also adds one spell of each spell level to his spell list, and these spells can be taken from any of the implement schools associated with the panoply. To use a panoply's resonant power or any of its focus powers, the occultist must select and invest mental focus into the associated implements that day. A single bearer must hold all the panoply's associated implements to gain the panoply's resonant power, and the occultist counts the total number of points of mental focus invested among all of the associated implements to determine the resonant power's effect. The occultist can expend points of mental focus from any of the associated implements to use the panoply's focus powers. Unlike for other implement schools, an occultist cannot select a panoply more than once.
