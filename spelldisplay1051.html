Components V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

Effect

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Effect ray
Duration 1 min./level
Saving Throw Fortitude partial; see text; Spell Resistance yes

Description

A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately exhausted for the spell's duration. A successful Fortitude save means the creature is only fatigued.

A character that is already fatigued instead becomes exhausted.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
