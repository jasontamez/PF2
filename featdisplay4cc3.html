Blasphemy comes quite naturally to you. When you interrupt your foes' divine spells, you use words, symbols, or gestures so abhorrent to their faith that they are repulsed by your deeds.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +5 or monk level 5th.

Benefit: When you use a monk weapon or unarmed strike to attack a creature that is casting a divine spell, the target is sickened for 1d4 rounds. A target can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to reduce the duration of the sickened effect to 1 round.
