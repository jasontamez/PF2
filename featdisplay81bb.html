Unlike others who have taken the oath against undeath (see page 60), your preoccupation with the undead does not cloud your view of good and evil.

Prerequisites: Detect undead paladin class feature.

Benefit:  You gain the detect evil class feature. You may use it or the detect undead class feature, but not at the same time.
