Description

This rough, fist-sized stone contains an inner cavity lined with crystals that have been infused with positive energy. When hurled at a hard surface up to 60 feet away, an effulgent geode explodes in a 20-foot-radius burst. Living creatures within the burst regain 1d8+9 hit points, while undead creatures within the burst take 1d8+9 points of damage (Fortitude DC 17 half). An effulgent geode worn or carried by a creature that fails a saving throw against an effect that deals negative energy damage must save successfully against the negative energy effect or it immediately explodes.
