Description

Giant seahorses (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 234) are commonly used as mounts and beasts of burden by undersea races such as aquatic elves and tritons. Although they are often dismissed as too skittish to be ridden into a fight, seahorses are clever and, with diligent training, make loyal war steeds. Tritons in particular pride themselves on breeding and training seahorses to fight in battle or to serve as guard animals.
