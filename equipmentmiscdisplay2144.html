Description

This volatile liquid is usually dispensed from a spray atomizer, which disperses the liquid in a 15-foot cone. Congealer spray causes the surface of an ooze creature to stiffen into a leathery material. Ooze and plant creatures in the affected area become staggered for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If an affected creature has the split defensive ability (Bestiary 2 302), it cannot benefit from that ability until the effects of the congealer spray wear off, regardless of whether the creature succeeded at its saving throw.
