Storm dreamers serve the Storm Kindlers by communing with their mystical predecessors. They serve as spiritual advisors for the organization, and are valued for the lore and wisdom they gain during their trances. During such a trance, a single storm dreamer can easily protect and defend a temple-or at the very least, provide suitably threatening defensive displays.

Mediums who become storm dreamers select their spirits normally, but the spirits with which they bond are supernatural remnants of the first Storm Kindlers' those reckless explorers who established the tradition but succumbed to their own arrogance and were consumed by the Eye of Abendego.

Some storm dreamers, though, become incapable of retaining their own personality and values, and transform into unpredictable forces of nature. Storm dreamers refer to this condition as being "stormcursed" and view these lost brothers and sisters with a mix of pity and horror. The stormcursed do not maintain ties with the Storm Kindlers, and in many cases their departure from the organization is violent and destructive. They are not viewed as heretics of Gozreh by the Storm Kindlers, but neither are they sought after as allies. They are typically treated as dangerous and unpredictable agents of the storm and allowed to dwell in relative peace in the remote locations where the stormcursed dreamers choose to dwell in. The exact cause of this condition is hotly debated among the storm dreamers themselves, for it seems to afflict their members almost randomly. Some believe these storm dreamers brushed too close to the "slumbering mind" of the Eye of Abendego, while others theorize that the mediums' souls simply got pulled away and replaced with some of the half-mad fragments the dreamers speak to in trance. The truth, whatever it is, may never be fully understood.

Gozreh's Domain (Su): All storm dreamers are deeply religious and select one of the domains granted by Gozreh: Air, Animal, Plant, Water, or Weather. The storm dreamer gains the 1st-level granted power from her chosen domain, but never gains the second power at higher level. When determining the effect of the granted power, the storm dreamer's effective cleric level is equal to her storm dreamer level. The 1st- through 6th-level bonus spells from this domain are added to her spell list. Despite her faith, these spells are cast normally, as psychic spells, by the medium.

This ability replaces spirit surge.

Storm Trance (Su): A 3rd-level storm dreamer can enter a meditative trance during which she fuses her mind to the Eye of Abendego, mentally becoming one with the great storm. Entering the trance is a full-round action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, but once in a storm trance, the storm dreamer can maintain the trance as a free action for a number of minutes per day equal to her storm dreamer class level + her Charisma modifier. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. While in a storm trance, the storm dreamer gains energy resistance 5 against cold and electricity, treats wind as one step less severe, and gains a bonus equal to her Charisma modifier on all saving throws against wind effects, spells with the air or electricity descriptors, and effects that deal electricity damage.

This ability replaces haunt channeler.

Dream Storm (Sp): At 5th level, a storm dreamer's thoughts can cause magical weather effects to manifest. While in a storm trance, she can cast call lightning, sleet storm, and wind wall as spell-like abilities (CL = her character level). Each time she casts one of these spell-like abilities, she reduces the number of remaining minutes for her storm trance by 1 minute; she can't use these spell-like abilities if she has less than 1 minute remaining for the day to use her storm trance.

This ability replaces location channel.

Storm Seer (Su): At 7th level, a storm dreamer gains a supernatural link to the weather and can sense her surroundings more clearly. While in her storm trance, she gains blindsense 10 feet and cannot be flanked. If the weather conditions are stormy, these senses become blindsight with a range of 30 feet.

This ability replaces connection channel.
