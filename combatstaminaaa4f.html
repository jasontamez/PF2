When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt to trip the target anyway. When you do, reroll the confirmation roll and use it to determine if the trip attempt exceeds the opponent's CMD. This reroll is used only for the trip combat maneuver; it can't cause the critical hit to be conf irmed. You still can't make the attempt if the target is immune to critical hits.
