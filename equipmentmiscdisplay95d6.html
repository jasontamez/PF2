Description

Artisan's clothing is well made from simple but durable cloth, appropriate for those who must work in various specialized and often manual trades, such as baking, carpentry, and other middleclass professions. This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.
