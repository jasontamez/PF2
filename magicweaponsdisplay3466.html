Description

This +2 cruel longsword features layers of cold iron and steel folded over one another repeatedly. The blade counts as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming a creature's damage reduction. Whenever a pactseeker's blade successfully deals at least 1 point of damage (after damage reduction) to a target, the weapon also deals damage equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus to each ally that shares an ongoing spell (such as haste) with or is otherwise magically bound to the target (such as other members of a hag coven). This damage disregards the range between the weapon's target and such bound creatures, and the damage bypasses damage reduction.
