Grasping vine shamans are typically adherents of one of several scattered sects dedicated to the Green Mother. They revere plant life in all its forms, with a special fondness for poisonous or carnivorous plants. Unlike most shamans, a grasping vine is guided by a plantlike creature rather than a spirit animal.

Spirit: Though a grasping vine is not limited to a particular choice of spirit, common selections are Life, Nature, or Wood (Pathfinder Player Companion Heroes of the Wild 26).

Plant Spirit (Ex): A shaman's spirit animal is made of leaves and thorny vines. This plant spirit has the statistics and abilities as a shaman's spirit animal, but it is treated as a creature of the plant type rather than a native outsider.

This ability alters the shaman's spirit animal.

Verdant Magic: A grasping vine adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic:  entangle (1st), barkskin (2nd), thorny entanglement (3rd), command plants (4th), wall of thorns (5th), fire seeds (6th), animate plants (7th), horrid wilting (8th), and shambler (9th).

This ability replaces the spirit magic spells granted by the shaman's spirit.

Greentongue (Sp): At 2nd level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can use speak with plants as a spell-like ability. The grasping vine can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half her shaman level. In addition, while under the effects of speak with plants, the grasping vine can deliver a suggestion (as per the spell) to a single plant creature within 30 feet, ignoring the plant's immunity to mind-affecting effects. The grasping vine can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, plus an additional time per day every 4 levels after 2nd level.

This ability replaces the shaman's hex gained at 2nd level.

Flower's Form (Sp): At 8th level, as a standard action, a grasping vine can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant creature, as per plant shape I. At 12th level, this ability functions as plant shape II. At 16th level, this ability functions as plant shape III. The grasping vine can use this ability for 1 minute per shaman level per day. This duration does not need to be used consecutively, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

This ability replaces the shaman's hex gained at 8th level.
