Description

This +1 bitter leather armor looks much like a blacksmith's apron or an alchemist's smock, and has many small pockets suitable for holding extracts, potions, or poisons. Once per day, the wearer can use negate aroma (lasting 1 hour). This effect suspends the armor's bitter special ability if used on the wearer. Once per day, the wearer can pull a tanglefoot bag from one of the apron's pockets, although the bag crumbles into dust if it is not used within 1 minute.
