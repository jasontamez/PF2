Fear passes quickly while you are raging.

Prerequisites: Orc, rage class feature.

Benefit:  While raging, when under the effect of a fear effect that allows a saving throw, you can make a new saving throw against that fear effect at the start of each of your turns before acting. If you make the new save, the fear effect ends.
