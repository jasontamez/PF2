Tactics

Before Combat The druid casts endure elements at the start of each day. Before a fight he drinks his potion of invisibility.
During Combat Once invisible, the druid moves away from his enemies. He spends the next few rounds casting speak with animals and his extended summon nature's ally spells, followed by magic fang and barkskin, cast from his wands on the summoned creatures. If the summoned creatures take damage, he heals them with his wand of cure moderate wounds. If his invisibility is compromised, he wild shapes into an eagle to keep out of reach.

Evasive as the wind, these skittish druids tend to stay away from others, using their formidable powers to escape even the most hazardous situations.

Velun The Slip

Once a slave, Velun escaped bondage with the help of a druid, who went on to train him. Once he felt he had learned all he could, he killed the druid, turning the mentor's wolf animal companion into a cloak. Velun now lives completely off the land, deathly afraid of cities and the slavers he believes lurk around every corner.

Combat Encounters: Given his extreme paranoia, Velun rarely teams up with any other sentient creatures, and the few times he does, he make sure they have few connections to other people so word of his location won't reach the ears of slavers or other corrupt city folk. Velun tries to stay out of combat, using his summoned creatures to ensure his escape.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Velun tends to think that all creatures that come looking for him are slavers in disguise. If he sees them coming, he sneaks away if he can. If they do manage to talk to him, he tells them almost nothing, as he believes that seeming useful or friendly makes him an even more appealing target for slavers. After he's encountered new people, Velun relocates to a new campsite so no one can track him down.
