Preparation This flowering herb must be picked whole and boiled with water until the entire amount is reduced by half. The resulting mixture is then strained and poured into a shallow pan to evaporate. The resulting crust is scraped off as a powder.
Use Anyone wearing or carrying fresh moly gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. Moly remains fresh in this way for only 12 hours, regardless of magical attempts to preserve it. When processed into a powder with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check, moly can be sprinkled on a creature, object, or area (a standard action) to end a spell as if with dispel magic (caster level 6th).

Description

Moly is a plant with flowers white as pure milk and roots black as night.
