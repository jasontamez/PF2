You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. If you have at least 1 point in your stamina pool, you can feint as a swift action, but the feint causes the opponent to become flat-footed only for your next attack rather than for all attacks until the beginning of your next turn.
