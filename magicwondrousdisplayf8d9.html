Description

This slim leather leash is just over 100 feet long, incredibly
light, and uncannily strong, making it an excellent tool for
training birds of prey and other flying predators. It grants a +4
circumstance bonus on any Handle Animal check made to train
such animals. When used to bind a flying animal companion
or familiar to its master, the leash allows the master to cast
feather fall on the creature at will. If the master has the share
touch spells class ability, once per day he can use that ability
on the leashed creature, even if they are not touching. The
delivered spell can be no higher than 3rd level. The creance
attaches to the master's forearm; attack rolls and skill checks
made with that arm take a -1 penalty.
