Description

These paired stone or metal weights look like a pair of curved stones with handles. An athlete can take one weight in each hand and swing them back and forth before jumping, using the momentum to gain greater distance when taking off. Training with halteres requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 16 Acrobatics check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to make long jumps. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail an Acrobatics check.
