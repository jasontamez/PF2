Description

This device seems like a medallion of thoughts, even down
to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts
overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will
save to sort them out. However, while the user thinks she is
picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really hearing are
figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts
always seem plausible, and thus can seriously mislead any who
rely upon them. What's worse, unknown to her, the cursed
medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures in the
path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.
