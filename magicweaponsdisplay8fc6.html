Description

This +1 ankus (see page 18) grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on wild empathy checks. Five times per day, the wielder can make a touch attack with the goad of obedience against any animal as a standard action. On a hit, the animal must succeed at a DC 11 Will save or be charmed by the wielder, as charm animal. An animal that successfully saves against this effect can't be charmed by the goad of obedience for 24 hours. In addition, once per day as an immediate action, the wielder can paralyze an animal hit by the goad of obedience, as hold animal (Will DC 13 negates).
