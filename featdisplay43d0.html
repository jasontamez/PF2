You have a special talent for ruling a nation, and take
to the task with ease.


Prerequisites: Hold a leadership role related to
running a kingdom.

Benefit:  Choose an ability score. Any time your
leadership role calls for that ability score to affect
one of your kingdom's attributes, your modifier to
that ability score is treated as being +2 higher. For
example, if you choose Charisma and occupy the
General or High Priest leadership role, your Charisma
modifier to affect your kingdom's stability would
be +2 higher than normal. However, if you occupied
the Spymaster leadership role-which employs the
Intelligence and Wisdom ability scores-this feat would
grant no benefit.

Additionally, the entire kingdom gains +2 Stability for
as long as you occupy a leadership role.


Special:  You may gain this feat multiple times, but
each time you must choose a different ability score. The
bonus to Stability gained from this feat stacks.
