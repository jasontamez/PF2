Description

Spartoi seeds appear as teeth stained by ash. The teeth themselves typically take the form of tiny dragon teeth, though some appear to come from a serpent, wolf, or human. When a tooth is cast upon the earth as a standard action, a spartolos under the user's command erupts on the following round. The spartolos lasts for 1 hour or until destroyed. A spartolos's equipment vanishes if its owner is destroyed or after an hour.

These seeds are typically found in simple pouches of leather or velvet containing 2d4 teeth. Up to six seeds can be sown by a single standard action.
