You've become so adept at combating summoned creatures that you can interrupt the magical energies that summon them to your plane.

Prerequisites: Arcane Strike or Disruptive; <a href="featdisplayac6b.html?ItemName=Banishing%20Critical">Banishing Critical</a>; <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>; <a href="featdisplayddac.html?ItemName=Dimensional%20Awareness">Dimensional Awareness</a>; Spellcraft 8 ranks; arcane pool class feature.

Benefit:  When you use Dimensional Awareness to make an attack of opportunity against a creature being summoned or called into a square you threaten, you can additionally use an immediate action to attempt to send the creature back to its home plane. Attempt a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + the creature's CR [minimum 1] + the spell level of the spell that summoned the creature). If you succeed, the creature does not get to act and is immediately sent back to its home plane.

Normal:  A summoning or calling spell can be disrupted only by a failed concentration check or by countering the spell.
