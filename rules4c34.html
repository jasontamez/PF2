Gothic horrors exude atmosphere and portent. This is the subgenre of The Castle of Otranto, The Raven, and Dracula. Lightning-illuminated castles, baroque cathedrals, tortured minds, and unquiet souls fill these stories, every element fostering moodiness and presaging dooms-often through ornate description. While gothic horror regularly focuses on darkness, decay, fallen grandeur, and the wages of sin, it can also be rich with romance and bravery, making it well suited to Pathfinder adventures.

Storytelling: More than any specific monster or type of fear, in the best of these stories, grim details work together to create an oppressive atmosphere of perpetual fall or winter, where secret transgressions exert dark prices in the form decrepitude, sickness, curses, and monstrous predation. Settings, characters, and plot all work together in gothic tales, and a GM should strive to insinuate that dark things are to come through elements of the narrative. If any subgenre is going to feature sudden thunderstorms, ominous coincidences, or peasant warnings, it's gothic horror. The evil force at the end of this foreboding path might have the statistics of a brooding vampire or an ageless wizard, but by the time the PCs meet her, what they've experienced should have built her up as something much more.

Gothic horror tales highlight and develop wealth, extravagance, and the noble or positive qualities of characters to better wring pathos from their ruination. Romances are also common, whether as the spark that ignites dark passions or as the motivation for heroics. Death, desperation, and madness are frequent results of both themes, paving the way for encounters with the fantastic, deals with wicked forces, and passions that keep characters from a peaceful death. Indulging these themes suggests not only a host of settings (like crumbling manors, grim cathedrals, and misty graveyards), but also stock characters (suspicious townsfolk, penniless nobles, and ghostly governesses) waiting to populate a gothic tale.

Monsters and Threats: The mainstays of gothic horror include some of the most identifiable monsters in fiction and folklore: fiends, <a href="monsterdisplaya37e.html?ItemName=Ghost">ghosts</a>, <a href="monsterfamilies0733.html?ItemName=Hag">hags</a>, <a href="monsterfamiliesc814.html?ItemName=Lycanthrope">lycanthropes</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay7b68.html?ItemName=mummies</a>,%20murderous%20animals,%20<a%20style=">skeletons</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay8a4a.html?ItemName=Vampire">vampires</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay3011.html?ItemName=Yeth%20Hound">yeth hounds</a>, and the like. Almost any monster could make a fine villain in a gothic horror story, though, so long as it has a tragic background and intentions of menace. For example, the sorrow of a lovelorn dryad might extend beyond herself, transforming a wilderness into a savage nightmare. Insidious magic items-like <a href="magicartifactsdisplay8272.html?ItemName=Monkey's%20Paw">monkeys' paws</a> and <a href="magicartifactsdisplay0ca4.html?ItemName=Soul%20Portrait">soul portraits</a>-also often appear in gothic stories, the objects taking on the sins of their past owners. Bargains with fiends, foul gods, or perhaps even death itself can inspire tragic villains. <a href="haunts0d47.html?ItemName=All">Haunts</a> also make useful threats for gothic horror tales, their descriptive dangers providing a way to reveal mournful histories-perhaps piece by piece through a series of interrelated, tragic events.

Basic Plots: Every hundred years, a <a href="monsterdisplayf6ba.html?ItemName=Graveknight">graveknight</a> appears and challenges the high priest of the goddess of valor, whose cathedral stands upon an ancient battlefield. A <a href="racesdisplay215e.html?ItemName=Changeling">changeling</a> begs for the PCs' protection, fearful of the crone she's seen in her nightmares. The PCs must retrieve a lost locket from a spectral house that appears only on the night of the winter solstice.

Advanced Plots: A PC is the reincarnated lover of an ancient vampire baroness. A <a href="monsterdisplay7c6e.html?ItemName=Mothman">mothman</a> follows the PCs from afar, intent on creating, ending, or repeating an age-long curse. The entire faith of a just deity is convinced a PC holds the key to a horrible prophecy and can't be allowed to live.
