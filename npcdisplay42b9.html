He banishes creatures summoned by foes, charms enemies with his staff, summons allies to protect him, turns uncharmed enemies against each other with confusion, and targets leaders with disintegrate or phantasmal killer.

A cruel conjurer directs his minions as if they were pawns in a game.

Alexi the Stern

Alexi prefers to work alone or in a position of command. He considers few beings to be his equals, perhaps because of the lifetime he's spent compelling obedience or summoning monstrous slaves to do his bidding. He prefers to be blunt and direct, and knows how to ask favors in a way that leaves no question that the request is actually an order.
