Discipline Powers: Your powers allow you to connect with and manipulate natural life.

Animal Mastery (Su): As a standard action, you can project your mind into the mind of an animal you can see, establishing a mental link that allows you to share the animal's senses-hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching everything the animal does. You cannot use this ability on an animal if its Hit Dice exceed your psychic level. The animal can attempt a Will save to resist the effect. If it is successful, the animal is immune to this ability for 24 hours. While sharing an animal's senses, your body is effectively unconscious, but you can end the effect as a free action. You can maintain the link for 1 hour per level, but the link is immediately severed if the animal moves beyond a range of 1 mile per psychic level you have. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 7th level, the mental link becomes stronger. Whenever you share an animal's senses, you can control it, as per dominate animal, except the duration, Hit Dice limit, range, and other conditions listed above apply.

One with Nature (Sp, Su): You can cast detect animals or plants as a spell-like ability at will. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks, and while using detect animals or plants, the bonus increases to +4 to identify a matching animal or plant creature within the area of effect. At 7th level, you can speak with any animal you successfully identify, as per speak with animals, but this ability doesn't make the creature any friendlier than normal.

Bionetwork (Su): At 5th level, your mental influence over nature increases. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes to mentally connect with living fungi, leaves, moss, roots, and similar plants or plantlike things. You form a temporary network that functions as an extension of your senses. The network allows you to use one of the following two effects: you can remotely view any familiar or obvious location within a range of 250 feet per psychic level, as per clairaudience/clairvoyance; or you can attempt to locate a creature within the area, as per scrying. You don't need a focus to use this effect, and you can't cast spells through the sensor. This ability doesn't function in areas of sparse vegetation, such as arid deserts, barren caverns, or frozen tundras. Buildings and urban areas are generally excluded from your network, but ruins reclaimed by nature are connected. While you're underground, roots and fungi function as your network, but the radius of the network is only 100 feet per psychic level. At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain an additional daily use of this ability.

Animate Trees (Su): At 13th level, you can animate a tree within 180 feet as a standard action. This functions as a treant's animate trees ability, with the following exceptions. Each day, you can animate a number of trees equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier, and you can control up to one tree at a time, plus an additional tree at 15th level and every 2 levels thereafter. A tree remains animated for 10 minutes per level, or until dismissed by you or destroyed.
