Description

This +6 keen speed adamantine dagger was constructed in defiance of the gods and their chosen mortal champions, for Legendsbane was created to slay mythic creatures. Legendsbane bypasses all types of damage reduction, and deals an additional 3d6 points of damage to mythic creatures and to non-mythic creatures that have epic DR. This additional damage is multiplied for critical hits.

Non-mythic characters can wield Legendsbane normally. However, when a mythic character first attempts to wield the dagger, she must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or suffer the effects of a destruction spell. If the mythic character survives, she can wield the dagger normally.

Legendsbane imparts upon its wielder the ability to track down mythic creatures she has hunted before. At will, the wielder can cast locate creature to find a specific mythic creature known to the wielder.

Destruction

Legendsbane can be destroyed if it's anointed in the blood of a slain 10th-rank mythic creature and then struck three times by a vorpal weapon. This act also destroys the vorpal weapon.
