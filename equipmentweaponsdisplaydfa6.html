Description

Behind this long pole weapon's spearhead, several short branches project from the shaft at irregular intervals, each angled forward and tipped with a smaller leaf like blade. When you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with an elven branched spear sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. Elves treat elven branched spears as martial weapons.
