Description

This special ability can be placed only on melee weapons that are designed to be thrown. If the wielder has the spellstrike class feature (such as from levels in the magus class), he can throw a spell hurling weapon to deliver a touch spell. If the spell hurling weapon hits, the touch spell targets the creature or object struck (if possible). Regardless of whether the weapon hits, any remaining touches with that spell are harmlessly discharged.
