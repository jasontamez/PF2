Description

The horse bow functions like a composite longbow, but it is designed to be used on horseback. A rider using a horse bow can make ranged attacks while mounted; furthermore, she does not take a penalty to attack rolls when her mount is taking a double move action, and she takes only a -4 penalty on attack rolls when her mount is running. The price of this item is for a default horse bow; each point of Strength bonus granted by the horse bow adds 150 gp to its cost.
