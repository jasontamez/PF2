Sickening Critical - Feats







Sickening Critical (Combat, Critical)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 133</a>
Your critical hits cause opponents to become sickened.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit: Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes sickened for 1 minute. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the effect's duration.

Special: You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.

When you threaten a critical hit using this feat, before rolling the confirmation roll, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do and the critical hit is confirmed, the foe is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10 + your base attack bonus, which reduces the effect to the normal sickened condition.
