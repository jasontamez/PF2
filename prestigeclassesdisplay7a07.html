The Steel Falcons are Andoran's spiritual and physical vanguard, spreading the government's philosophical ideologies by whatever means necessary. This can be anything from bribing a foreign noble with inside information, to breaking the chains of the enslaved, to orchestrating widespread rebellion in an unfriendly land. While they occasionally serve as envoys and diplomats, Steel Falcons must be skilled at a variety of techniques if they expect to survive in hostile lands and accomplish their missions. The ability to utilize traps is as important to the Steel Falcon as the camaraderie she shares with her fellows. And while manipulating an enemy's emotions and seeking diplomatic solutions can solve some problems, others present no solution other than battle.

Among the Eagle Knights, Steel Falcons have a reputation for being egotistical and self-aggrandizing. While the Steel Falcons are regarded as the faces and voices of the Andoren people by most non-Andorens, the perception that they are braggarts is more often than not the result of cordial rivalry among the branches. Steel Falcons, while occasionally braggadocios, are more aptly characterized by their shared zeal, dedication, selflessness, and diplomatic acumen. They are certainly aware of their reputation among the other branches of the Eagle Knights, but bear this knowledge stoically and patiently, knowing that all three branches of the group are necessary to ensure Andoran's continued success-they do not hold grudges.

The following are features of the Steel Falcon prestige class.

Enemy of Slavers (Ex): From the start, the Steel Falcon focuses much of her training on how to interact with slavers, both in combat and in diplomatic confrontations. A Steel Falcon gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against slavers and slave owners. Likewise, she gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. At 5th level, this bonus increases to +4, and at 9th level it increases to +6. This is treated as a favored enemy bonus. If the Steel Falcon has a favored enemy bonus from another class and her target is a slaver as well as a favored enemy of another type, the bonuses do not stack, and she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

Heart of Freedom (Ex): A Steel Falcon gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion effects and attempts to possess her body or mind.

Sailor and Survivalist (Ex): A Steel Falcon adds her class level to Profession (sailor) checks and Survival checks to get along in the wild and navigate in the wilderness.

Luck of the Eagle (Ex): At 2nd level, once per day, a Steel Falcon can reroll any one d20 roll before she learns the result of that roll, but she must take the new roll, even if it is lower. At 6th level, the Steel Falcon can use luck of the eagle twice per day, and at 10th level, she can do so three times per day.

Heroic Speech (Su): At 3rd level, a Steel Falcon can inspire her allies with tales of greatness, heroism, and the ideals of Andoran. This functions like the inspire courage aspect of bardic performance, treating the Steel Falcon's class level as her bard level when determining the effect; if the Steel Falcon has levels in bard, her class levels stack with her bard levels when determining the effect of this ability and the effect of her inspire courage bard ability. The Steel Falcon can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her class level + her Charisma modifier.

Natural Traps (Ex): As part of their guerilla warfare activities, Steel Falcons learn how to use the natural environment to create traps. At 3rd level, the Steel Falcon gains Learn Ranger Trap as a bonus feat (she does not need to meet the feat's normal prerequisite of 5 ranks in Survival). As per the rules for that feat, she learns one extraordinary ranger trap (chosen from the following: alarm trap, burning trap, exploding trap, fire trap, marking trap, poison trap, snare trap, and swarm trap). At 6th level, the Steel Falcon learns a second trap, and at 9th level she learns a third trap. The number of times she can use a trap is equal to her class level + her Wisdom bonus.

Comrade's Bond (Ex): At 4th level, a Steel Falcon's love of freedom and hatred of slavery are so great that she evokes similar feelings in her companions. Once per day as a move action, she can grant her allies half her enemy of slavers bonus against all appropriate targets in sight; the allies must be within 30 feet and able to see or hear her. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Steel Falcon's Charisma bonus (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any favored enemy bonuses her allies have; they use whichever bonus is higher. At 7th level, the Steel Falcon can use comrade's bond twice per day, and activating it is a swift action. At 10th level, she can use this ability three times per day, and activating it is a free action.

Superior Aid (Ex): At 4th level, when performing the aid another action, a Steel Falcon grants a +4 bonus on the ally's attack roll or to the ally's Armor Class instead of the normal +2.

Subtle Manipulator (Ex): At 5th level, if the Steel Falcon spends a full-round action studying a target, she can attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the target's Will save. If she succeeds, she gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks against that opponent for a number of days equal to her Wisdom modifier. This ability can be used on a given target once per day, and a successful use resets its duration.

Talmandor's Blessing (Su): At 5th level, a Steel Falcon gains the blessing of Talmandor, the avoral patron of Andoran. She gains a +10 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks to make high or long jumps, a +4 bonus on Perception checks, and the benefits of feather fall at all times. If this effect is dispelled, you can reactivate it as a move action.

Chainbreaker (Ex): At 6th level, a Steel Falcon's attacks against bindings, chains, and manacles bypasses up to 10 points of hardness. This includes weapons with chains (such as flails, nunchaku, and spiked chains), a kyton's armor and weapons, chains animated by animate objects, and so on. The Steel Falcon also gains a +10 bonus on all checks to escape bindings with manacles or ropes.

Talmandor's Fury (Su): At 7th level, once per day as a standard action, a Steel Falcon can channel her rage at the injustice in the world, transforming her countenance into a terrifying display of righteous fury, giving her a fear aura with a range of 30 feet. Enemies within this radius are affected by a fear spell (CL 10th, Will DC 15 + the Steel Falcon's Charisma bonus). All other creatures in the area (including the Steel Falcon) are bolstered by the Steel Falcon's wrath and can immediately attempt new saving throws against any charm, compulsion, or possession effects currently affecting them. The Steel Falcon can use this ability if she is conscious, even if paralyzed or under the effect of a charm, compulsion, or possession that affects her judgment.
