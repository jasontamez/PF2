Description

This undistinguished metal lump has no powers in its default
state. By concentrating on it for 1 minute, a creature who
worships a deity may transform it into a masterwork holy
symbol of that deity. Whenever this holy symbol is used as
a focus for channeled energy, as a free action the bearer can
alter the channel area to one of the following options:
<ul><li>10-foot burst centered anywhere within 30 feet
</li><li>60-foot line
</li><li>30-foot cone</li></ul>
The symbol reverts to its nondescript lump form after
being away from its bearer for 24 hours.
