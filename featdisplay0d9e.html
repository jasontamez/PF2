Your spell-like ability deals more damage.

Prerequisites: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

Benefit: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as an intensified spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

When you use an intensified spell-like ability, the maximum number of the ability's damage dice increases by 5 levels. You must have sufficient caster levels to surpass the normal maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell-like ability are affected, and spell-like abilities that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat.

You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
