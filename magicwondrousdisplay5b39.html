Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This bronze bracelet has seven charms shaped like symbols of good luck in halfling society. It works only for a wearer with the luck or adaptable luck racial trait. At any time, a halfling wearer can choose to reroll a roll without taking an action. She must take the new result even if it is worse. When the wearer uses this ability, one of the bracelet's charms crumbles to dust. When all the charms are spent, the bracelet becomes nonmagical. The wearer can remove a charm from the bracelet and give it to another creature to grant that creature the charm's ability to reroll die rolls, but if unused before the next sunrise, the charm turns to dust anyway.
