You have boundless faith in your success.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, <a href="featdisplay637c.html?ItemName=Fearless%20Curiosity">Fearless Curiosity</a>, Intimidate 5 ranks, human.

Benefit:  You gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against effects with the emotion descriptor; this bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Fearless Curiosity. When you confirm a critical hit, as a free action you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize one creature you threaten. If you have the Dazzling Display feat, you can make Intimidate checks to demoralize all creatures you threaten instead. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if your weapon has a ??3 critical modifier, or +4 if it has a ??4 critical modifier.
