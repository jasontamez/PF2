Description

This small glass vial contains an effervescent blue liquid. When imbibed, a vial of reckless courage instills a sense of bravery in the drinker, granting a +4 enhancement bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the drinker is under a fear effect, she can attempt a new saving throw with a +2 bonus. The drinker becomes eager to rush into danger, and as a result, all of her modes of movement (including burrow, climb, fly, and swim speeds) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of double her normal speed in any given form of movement, for 5 rounds.
