Desna has taken a liking to you and guides you from the stars as you travel.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (geography) 5 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.

Benefit: Once per day during overland travel, you can attempt a DC 25 Knowledge (geography) check to follow the stars. On a success, you and up to eight other creatures use Desna's mystical guidance to travel twice the usual distance during overland travel.
