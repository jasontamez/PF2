Description

A skulking sniper's blowgun is crafted of fine hardwood that shifts color between brown and dark green under different lights. The wielder of this +3 distance greater sniping (see page 27) blowgun isn't automatically detected by tremorsense, blindsense, blindsight, or similar supernatural senses while she's attempting to move unnoticed. Creatures with these abilities must attempt a Perception check opposed by the wielder's Stealth check to notice the wielder. Such a creature gains a +10 bonus on this Perception check if the wielder is within half the maximum range of the sense ability. The wielder can still be detected by other senses (such as vision, hearing, or smell) as normal.
