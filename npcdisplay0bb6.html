The sacred guardian serves the goddess of beauty and love. He protects a holy site, preferring to deflect and warn rather than harm or destroy.

Pindle Finberry

An aficionado of art, music, and sculpture, Pindle would be content spending his days creating beautiful things for people to wear and use. He knows there is ugliness in the world that would destroy all beauty, so he has sworn to be a shield against these defilers. In his heart, he wants peace and serenity, and hopes that his words and deeds can turn away the forces of destruction. While many might see him as an idealistic hero, the truth is that Pindle values art more than people, and will happily steal or overlook suffering if it's necessary to preserve great art.

Combat Encounters: Pindle is a capable guardian and might agree to guard a place or thing as a favor for an allied church or devotee of beauty-even if this pits him against good-aligned PCs. If the PCs steal a valuable gem, art object, or magic item relevant to his interests (or if he has been led to believe this), he might track them down and insist that they return it, or even take it by force if necessary.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Pindle is knowledgeable about art, gems, famous armors, and similar topics. He-d gladly accompany most PCs to an exotic location of great beauty or in search of a lost art object.
