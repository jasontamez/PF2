Description

This heavy gold neck ring resembles a braided rope. When the wearer performs a raging song or benefits from an ally's raging song, she gains the Diehard feat for the duration of the song. In addition, she benefits from any helpful raging song or bardic performance for 1 round after the performance ends or would normally cease affecting the wearer. This does not stack with other means of prolonging the effects of a performance that has ended.
