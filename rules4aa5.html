While the list of actions in this section is long and covers most of the major actions in the game, it's not exhaustive. There are many actions that are not covered in these pages. The following are guidelines for converting such actions from the default action economy to this one.

Free Actions Are Always Free Actions: A free action in the default action economy is a free action in this one. Free actions typically don't have a subtype, and thus don't provoke attacks of opportunity. Keep in mind that some free actions are used in conjunction with other actions-that's still true in this system. To use such a free action, you must take the other action it supports.

Swift Actions Are Always Simple Actions: A swift action in the default action economy is always a simple action in this system. You need commit only 1 act to take that action. In rare cases, a GM might want to limit a given swift action to only once per turn.

Move Actions Are Always Simple Actions: A move action in the default action economy is always a simple action in this system.

Standard-Action Attacks Are Typically Simple Actions: Most actions that involve an attack roll or a combat maneuver check as a standard action in the standard economy are simple actions in this system. For combat maneuvers that can't be substituted for one attack in a full-attack action and other complicated attacks, consider making them attack actions that require further consecutive acts to complete. Look at combat maneuvers such as drag, grapple, and reposition for examples of such actions.

Standard-Action Supernatural and Spell-Like Abilities Are Advanced Actions: Typically, these actions are advanced actions that require 2 acts. Supernatural abilities tend not to have a subtype (unless they involve movement or attacking, in which case it might be fitting to grant them those subtypes), and spell-like abilities typically have the complex subtype.

Full-Round Actions Are Advanced Actions: Full-round actions are nearly always advanced actions that require a consecutive 3-act commitment. (See the charge advanced action for an example of one that doesn't require 3 acts.)
