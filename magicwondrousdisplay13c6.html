Description

Made to enhance the most seductive Varisian dances, this collection of silken scarves is patterned in yellow and black. Varisian worshipers of Calistria weave these scarves in the shadow of the Irespan, drawing upon the ancient evocation magic they call ragario to imbue the silk with vengeful energies. Scarves of the stinging dancer grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (dance) checks, similar to that granted by masterwork musical instruments; this effect is nonmagical and cannot be dispelled.

To activate the scarves' magic, the wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Perform (dance) check. This check can be attempted as part of a move action in which the wearer moves no more than half his speed (including when he uses the Acrobatics skill to avoid enemies) or as part of an attack action or full attack in which the wearer uses only a bladed scarf to attack. Once activated, the scarves' magic lasts until the beginning of the wearer's next turn.

While the scarves' magic is active, whenever the wearer is successfully targeted by a harmful spell, hit by a melee or ranged attack, or touched against his will, the scarves lash out at the source of the attack (a creature if it's a spellcaster or an individual holding a magic item, or an object if the source is a trap or otherwise unattended) with a magic missile (CL 3rd). This missile takes the form of an angrily buzzing wasp. The scarves can be deactivated as a free action.

The scarves of the stinging dancer can create 50 missiles before losing their magic. At this point, the scarves can no longer cast magic missile, but they still provide the +2 bonus on Perform (dance) checks.
