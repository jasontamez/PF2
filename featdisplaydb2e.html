Your firm dedication to the principles of courage and freedom allows you to escape your bonds more easily.

Prerequisites: Bravery class feature, worshiper of Cayden Cailean.

Benefit: You can add the bonus from bravery to Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple. If your bonus from bravery is +2 or higher, then once per day, you can grant that bonus to an ally within 30 feet on a Will save against a fear effect, an Escape Artist check, or a combat maneuver check to escape a grapple. Granting this bonus to an ally is an immediate action and must be declared before the result of your ally's check is revealed.
