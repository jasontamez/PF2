Ritual

Enduring Alteration (Su) Your spells resist reality's attempts to restore the things you change. You can spend this boon to apply the benefits of the Extend Spell feat to a transmutation spell as you cast it. This also increases the DC to dispel that spell (via dispel magic or similar abilities) by 4. This boon does not increase the spell level or casting time of your spell.
