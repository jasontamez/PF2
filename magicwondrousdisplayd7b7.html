Description

When wrapped around the neck and jaw, this swath of black cloth lets its wearer see normally in a sandstorm (her vision isn't reduced, nor does she take the -4 penalty on Perception checks) and avoid taking nonlethal damage from the storm.

Once per day on command, the shawl's wearer can emit a strange cackling. Enemies within 30 feet of the shawl's wearer who can hear the cackling must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or become frightened for 1 round. Those who succeed at the saving throw are shaken for 1d4 rounds instead. Both of the cackle's effects are sonic mind-affecting fear effects.
