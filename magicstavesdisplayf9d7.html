Description

This dark mahogany staff is carved in the shape of a squid's  tentacle and smells strongly of seawater. When grasped, the staff animates, writhing momentarily until it regains its rigid, wooden form. As a swift action, the wielder can transform the staff into a long, flexible weapon that functions as a masterwork whip. The staff reverts to its normal form at the beginning of the wielder's next turn.

The staff allows the use of the following spells. <ul><li>Summon monster II (octopus or squid only; 1 charge)</li> <li>Black tentacles (3 charges)</li> <li>Summon monster VI (giant octopus only; 5 charges)</li></ul>
