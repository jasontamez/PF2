Description

When this magical belt is put on, the wearer must immediately
make a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or be transformed into
a person of the opposite gender. The character's abilities,
mind, and spirit remain unaffected; only the character's sex
changes. If the character's saving throw is a natural 1, the item
actually removes all gender from the wearer, giving him an
androgynous, neutered appearance. The change is permanent
unless undone with curse-removing magic. Once its magic
takes effect, the belt can be removed without effort. A creature
can only be affected by a particular girdle once, though other
girdles of this type can cause further transformations.
