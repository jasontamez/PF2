Your curses are particularly tenacious.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast a spell or spell-like ability with the curse descriptor, or a special ability with a curse effect.

Benefit: Any curse effect you create is difficult to remove. When a creature makes a caster level check to remove the curse, it must roll twice and take the worse result.
