Description

Rather than opening to locations on different planes, this well instead opens to worlds on the Material Plane. It does not, however, necessarily open to worlds with similar environments to that of its user; hence it can pose much the same danger as the traditional well in terms of both the unpredictable environs of the destination and the alien beings that might step through from the other side.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, gate; Cost 30,000 gp
