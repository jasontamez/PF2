Description

This grotesque collar is useful to any witch who is eager to form a coven, but would rather avoid associating with one or more evil hags. The collar is a crude band of iron from which hang the fistsized shrunken heads of three hags (an annis hag, a green hag, and a sea hag). The heads remain semi-animate-they occasionally twitch, blink, coo softly, or whisper curses at the wearer, each other, or anyone else nearby. A witch with the coven hex who wears the collar gains access to the following powers.

Champion of the Unbound Coven: If the wearer joins a coven, the coven can ignore the requirement to have at least one hag as a member. Each of the coven members must still have the coven hex, and one of the members must be at least a 9th-level witch.

Dreadful Gaze: Three times per day as a swift action, the wearer can command the hags' heads to lock their terrible gazes on one humanoid within 30 feet. The target of this gaze attack must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become paralyzed with terror (as the effect of the hold person spell). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Hag Form: Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can assume the form of a powerfully built Medium crone that resembles the horrific union of an annis hag, a green hag, and a sea hag. This metamorphosis is identical to the transformation spell, including the violent change to the wearer's mindset and the loss of spellcasting ability.
