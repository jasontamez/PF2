Spring Attack - Feats







Spring Attack (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 134</a>
You can deftly move up to a foe, strike, and withdraw before he can react.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can move up to your speed and make a single melee attack without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack. You can move both before and after the attack, but you must move at least 10 feet before the attack and the total distance that you move cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn.

Normal: You cannot move before and after an attack.

You can spend 5 stamina points to use this feat as a standard action instead of a full-round action.

Mythic Spring Attack

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 74</a>
You move across the battlefield in a blur of whirling blades.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6916.html?ItemName=Spring%20Attack">Spring Attack</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  When you use Spring Attack, you don't need to move at least 10 feet before making the first attack. If you expend one use of mythic power when you start a Spring Attack, the movement you make during the Spring Attack doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
