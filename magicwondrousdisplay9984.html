Description

Dried, lacquered, and stuffed with fragrant herbs, this mummified medusa head still contains a measure of the power the medusa possessed in life. While held, a meduseion radiates an unseen aura that causes all living creatures within 100 feet to take a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist poison or petrification effects. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder of a meduseion can cause the eyes of the head to shoot forth a petrifying ray as a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 100 feet. Creatures struck must succeed a DC 19 Fortitude save or be permanently transformed into stone.
