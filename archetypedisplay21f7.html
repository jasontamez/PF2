Some inquisitors embrace the dark powers of their traditional foes, turning such powers toward their own ends in order to pronounce judgment on those who oppose them. These inquisitors learn to use the hexes and some spells of witches, but must pay the price for dealing with supernatural powers, as they slip ever closer to the evil they seek to destroy.

Withering Gaze (Su): Hexenhammers study the effects of a witch's evil eye, and can use this dark magic to steel their gaze in a similar manner. Beginning at 1st level, whenever a hexenhammer successfully demoralizes a creature as a standard action, instead of applying the shaken condition, she can apply the effects of the witch evil eye hex as if she were a 1stlevel witch (save DC = 10 + 1/2 the hexenhammer's inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier).

This ability replaces monster lore and stern gaze.

Pride and Penance (Ex): Hexenhammers are deeply conflicted about their dealings with dark powers. If a hexenhammer uses a hex or casts a spell gained from the witch class spell list, she temporarily loses access to her domain abilities and her cunning mind bonus until she undergoes a brief period of penance and atonement that takes 1 minute of quiet prayer and contemplation; this atonement doesn't require any additional cost, and it automatically restores the lost abilities, regardless of how many times the hexenhammer uses her dark powers. If the hexenhammer uses her dark trade ability (see below) to trade uses of judgment for hexes, she loses access to her domain abilities and cunning mind bonus until the next time she regains her spell slots for the day.

This ability alters domain.

Cunning Mind (Ex): At 2nd level, a hexenhammer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against hexes, curses, spells of the necromancy school, and spells with the evil descriptor.

This ability replaces cunning initiative.

Hexcrafter (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a hexenhammer learns to turn some powers of witches to her own advantage. She learns either the blight, the misfortune, or the slumber hex from the witch's hex list, and can use that hex once per day as a standard action, using her inquisitor level in place of a witch level. If the hex allows a saving throw, the save DC to resist the hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the inquisitor's level + the inquisitor's Wisdom modifier.

At 6th level, 12th, and 15th levels, the hexenhammer learns an additional hex from her available hexes. At 9th level and 18th level, the hexenhammer can use any one of her hexes one additional time per day. At 12th level, the hexenhammer adds the agony, nightmares, and retribution major hexes to her list of learnable hexes.

This ability replaces teamwork feats.

Dark Trade (Su): At 3rd level, a hexenhammer can forgo the power of her judgments and succumb to the temptation of darker powers. She can trade a daily use of judgment to instead gain an additional use of one of her hexes.

This ability replaces solo tactics.

Witchcraft (Ex): At 5th level and at every 3 inquisitor levels thereafter, a hexenhammer can learn a witch spell in place of a spell she already knows. In effect, she loses an old spell in exchange for a new one selected from the witch class spell list. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level inquisitor spell she can cast. The hexenhammer can swap out only a single spell at any given level and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time she gains new spells known for the level.

This ability alters the inquisitor's spellcasting.
