Aromaphile

Rather than employ the baleful glares of the typical mesmerist, aromaphiles hypnotize others using an array of sickeningly sweet scents developed from their unique ghoran physiology.

Hypnotic Aroma (Su):  As a swift action, an aromaphile can use unique aspects of ghoran biology to release intoxicating aromas in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on him. All creatures within this area, as well as creatures with scent within 30 feet, take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty becomes -3 at 8th level. The aroma hovers around the aromaphile, moving with him, and lasts for 1 minute. The hypnotic aroma must be inhaled to be effective, and creatures that choose to hold their breath, do not breathe, or are immune to inhaled poisons are immune to its effect.

This replaces hypnotic stare, painful stare, and towering ego.

Debilitating Aroma (Su):  At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, an aromaphile can imbue his hypnotic aroma with other effects. These effects are the same as those listed within the bold stare mesmerist class feature, but they affect creatures affected by his hypnotic aroma for as long as they are affected by that ability. The aromaphile chooses one option each time he gains a new debilitating aroma improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The aromaphile can't choose the same debilitating aroma more than once unless otherwise noted.

This replaces bold stare.

Aromatic Manipulation (Su):  At 3rd level, the aromaphile can touch a creature affected by his hypnotic aroma to alter its mental state. This functions as the touch treatment class feature, except the aromaphile cannot remove the confused, cowering, or stunned conditions, and he cannot break enchantments using this ability. Instead, he adds fatigued to his list of minor conditions and exhausted to his list of greater conditions.

An aromaphile can also use this ability to inflict hampering conditions on a target by touching it. At 3rd level, he can cause his target to become fascinated by his aroma. At 6th level, he can deaden the target's emotions (as per calm emotions). At 10th level, he can cause the target to become stunned. At 14th level, he can cause the target to fall asleep (as per deep slumber, except the Hit Die limit is equal to the aromaphile's level + 2). The target can attempt a Will save to negate these effects (DC = 10 + half the aromaphile's level + the aromaphile's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the target gains the chosen condition for a number of rounds equal to the aromaphile's level. Each round that the target is affected, it can attempt a new Will save at the same DC to end the effect early. If the target succeeds at such a save, its turn immediately ends.

This alters touch treatment and replaces mental potency.
