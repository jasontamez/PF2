The <a href="monsterdisplay99e0.html?ItemName=Night%20Hag">night hag</a> soul collector is not only a dangerous opponent; she is also dangerously well connected. She can force her captured souls to do her bidding to augment her own combat effectiveness, granting her powers from the summoner class graft.
Array: This night hag is a summoner for all practical purposes, so she uses the spellcaster array, albeit with increased ability modifiers to reflect the fact that she is physically imposing for a spellcaster.
Creature Type: Since her type is outsider, the night hag gains darkvision and a +2 bonus on attack rolls. She trades the outsider saving throw adjustments for the summoner adjustments.
Class: The night hag soul collector's summoner class graft increases her Fortitude and Reflex by 1 and grants Knowledge (planes) as a master skill. The lost soul acts as her eidolon. The night hag is thematically similar to a summoner, but isn't treated as actually having class levels in summoner.
Spells: The night hag uses a modified version of the conjuration spell list, to stay in theme with her spontaneous summoning from the summoner class graft. As a soul broker, she needs constant detection spells to inspect her merchandise, as well as the soul bind spell at will.
Options: From the summoner graft, the night hag gains spontaneous magic (summon monster), as well as one magic option and one any option. She chooses change shape and a custom dream haunting option to allow her to torment her foes from safety. To represent the defenses necessary to ply her trade among evil outsiders, the night hag also has particularly potent spell resistance and damage reduction options for her CR.
Skills: A night hag encounter might be social and deceptive, so the monster has additional master and good skills, and her +10 bonus from change shape is reflected in her Disguise skill.
Damage: For damage with three primary attacks, the night hag doubles the damage for two primary attacks (18) to get a total of 36, then divides by three (her total number of attacks). Each attack deals roughly 12 points of damage
Lost Soul: This represents the twisted form of a lost soul that the night hag can call forth to defend her- effectively her eidolon, since she is using the summoner graft. The soul's twisted form has screaming mouths on long tendrils that bite as it moves, allowing it to pounce.
Array: As an eidolon, the lost soul uses the combatant array.
Creature Type: The outsider type graft grants the lost soul a +2 bonus on attack rolls and Reflex saving throws.
Size: The lost soul's Large size grants it -1 to touch AC, +1 to flat-footed AC, +2 to CMB, and +1 to CMD.
Options: As a combatant, the lost soul gains one combat option and one any option. For these options, it gains pounce and damage reduction.
Skills: While a combatant normally has one master skill and two good skills, the lost soul is simple, so the GM gives it only Intimidate as a master skill and Fly as a good skill.
Damage: To determine its damage with four primary attacks, the lost soul doubles the damage value for two primary attacks (22) to get 44 points of damage, then divides by 4. Each attack deals 11 points of damage, or 1d8+6 on <RULES%Assigning Damage&Category=Step 9: Damage">Table 5-9</a>.
