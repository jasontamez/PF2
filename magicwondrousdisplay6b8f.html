Description

This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick
cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell.
The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower
each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog
cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the
emanation point unless blocked by something substantial
such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise,
with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end
of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate
wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind
(21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
