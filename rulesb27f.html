In the background skills system, classes use their standard class skill lists. Any class that gains Craft or Perform as a class skill also counts Artistry as a class skill. Lore is always considered a class skill for all characters.

For example, a wizard has Appraise on his class skill list normally, so a wizard has the Appraise background skill as a class skill. Craft is also on his class skill list, so Artistry is a class skill for him as well (even though Perform isn't on his class skill list).

When converting to the consolidated skills system in the middle of an ongoing campaign, it's typically best to allow each player to completely reset her character's skill ranks and spend them again from scratch. She should also be able to retrain any feats or other abilities that affect her skill bonuses.
