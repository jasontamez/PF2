Description

With a gentle caress, you infuse the creature touched with a blight of energy from the Abyss that feeds upon goodness and transforms flesh into monstrous deformity. The target can resist a teratoid caress with a successful Fortitude save, but even on a successful save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round by the vile energies.

If the target fails the save, his body becomes infected with Abyssal energy and a small portion of his body distorts and grows hideous, inflicting 2 points of Dexterity damage or 2 points of Charisma damage (50% chance of either effect). This deformity is always unsightly and offensive. Thereafter, the victim suffers a -1 penalty on all saving throws against evil effects. Worse, whenever the victim casts a good spell, channels positive energy, or offers a prayer to a good-aligned deity, the Abyssal energies seethe inside him, forcing a new Fortitude save to resist suffering an additional 1 point of Dexterity or Charisma damage. A good-aligned divine spellcaster who suffers from this curse suffers a -4 penalty on all concentration checks. This is a curse effect, but the effect can also be instantly removed with a dispel evil or atonement spell.
