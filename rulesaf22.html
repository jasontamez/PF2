Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 58</a>
You can manipulate other people through negotiation, deceit, or intimidation.

Core Skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate.

<a href="rulesa3c9.html?Name=Change%20Others%20Attitudes&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Change Others' Attitudes</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 58</a>
You can use Influence to change the attitudes of NPCs. The DC is determined by the target's starting attitude plus its Charisma modifier. If you succeed, you improve the target's attitude toward you by one step, plus one more step if you beat the DC by 5 or more. You can't shift an attitude by more than two steps with a single check. If you fail by 4 or less, the target's attitude is unchanged, and if you fail by 5 or more, the target's attitude decreases by one step. An attitude shift typically lasts 1d4 hours. You can use Influence to make a request of a creature whose attitude toward you is indifferent or better.

You can't change the attitude of a creature that doesn't understand you or that has an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. This function of Influence is generally ineffective in combat.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Starting Attitude</td><td>Influence DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Hostile</td><td>25 + target's Cha modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Unfriendly</td><td>20 + target's Cha modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Indifferent</td><td>15 + target's Cha modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Friendly</td><td>10 + target's Cha modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Helpful</td><td>0 + target's Cha modifier</td></tr> </table>

Action: 1 minute of continuous interaction.

Try Again: You can't attempt to change a creature's attitude more than once per 24-hour period.

<a href="rulese85a.html?Name=Create%20Diversions&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Create Diversions</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 59</a>
You can create a diversion to hide. You attempt an Influence check against the viewer's opposed Perception check to sense motive. If you succeed, you can attempt a Stealth check. When applicable, use the same modifiers from the lie function.

Action: Standard.

Try Again: Yes.

<a href="rules10a8.html?Name=Demoralize&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Demoralize</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 59</a>
You can cause an opponent to become shaken. The DC equals 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier. If you succeed, the target is shaken for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 by which you exceeded the DC. Your target must be within 30 feet and able to clearly see and hear you. Demoralizing the same creature again extends the duration; it doesn't cause a stronger fear condition.

Action: Standard.

Try Again: Yes, but each additional check against the same target increases the DC by 5. This increase resets after 1 hour.

Size Bonus: You gain a +4 bonus on checks to demoralize creatures smaller than you and take a -4 penalty on checks to demoralize creatures larger than you.

<a href="rules3765.html?Name=Feint%20in%20Combat&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Feint in Combat</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 59</a>
<a href="rules9063.html?Name=Feint&amp;Category=Special%20Attacks">Feinting in combat is described here</a>. You use Influence instead of the Bluff core skill, and your opponent uses Perception instead of the Sense Motive core skill.

Action: Standard.

Try Again: Yes.

<a href="rulescee8.html?Name=Gather%20Information&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Gather Information</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 60</a>
By canvassing people at local taverns, markets, and gathering places, you can attempt to learn about a specific topic or individual. The GM might rule that some topics are unknown to common folk.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Information Sought</td><td>Influence DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Common facts or rumors</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>Obscure or secret knowledge</td><td>20 or higher</td></tr> </table>

Action: 1d4 hours.

Try Again: Yes.

<a href="rules82ae.html?Name=Intimidate&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Intimidate</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 60</a>
You can force an opponent to act friendly toward you for 1d6 ?? 10 minutes with a successful Influence check. The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier. If you succeed, the target gives you the information you desire, takes actions that don't endanger it, and otherwise offers limited assistance. Once the intimidation expires, the target becomes unfriendly and might report you to the authorities. If you fail by 5 or more, the target attempts to deceive you or otherwise hinder your activities.

Action: 1 minute of conversation.

Try Again: Yes, but each additional check increases the DC by 5. This increase resets after 1 hour.

Size Bonus: You gain a +4 bonus on checks to intimidate creatures smaller than you and take a -4 penalty on checks to intimidate creatures larger than you.

<a href="rules9196.html?Name=Lie&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Lie</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 60</a>
You can try to fool someone by attempting an Influence check. The DC of this check is the result of your opponent's Perception check to sense motive. Apply the appropriate modifiers from the table below. These modifiers stack with each other, but apply only one modifier related to the believability of the lie-the more outlandish the lie, the harder it is to make others believe it. The GM might rule that attempts to tell extremely improbable lies automatically fail.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Lie Circumstances</td><td>Influence Check Modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Target wants to believe you</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Lie is believable</td><td>+0</td></tr> <tr><td>Lie is unlikely</td><td>-5</td></tr> <tr><td>Lie is far-fetched</td><td>-10</td></tr> <tr><td>Lie is impossible</td><td>-20</td></tr> <tr><td>Target is drunk or impaired</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>You have convincing proof</td><td>Up to +10</td></tr> </table>

Action: 1 round, or longer if the lie is elaborate.

Try Again: Yes. Further checks against the same target take a -10 penalty.

<a href="rulesfc23.html?Name=Make%20Requests&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Make Requests</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 60</a>
You can make a request of a creature if its attitude toward you is indifferent or better. Use the DC from the table in the Change Attitudes section, with one of the following modifiers. A creature that's helpful typically gives in to most requests without a check unless the request is against its nature or puts it in serious peril. The GM might rule that some requests automatically fail if they're against a creature's values or nature.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Request</td><td>Influence DC Modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Give simple advice or directions</td><td>-5</td></tr> <tr><td>Give detailed advice</td><td>+0</td></tr> <tr><td>Give simple aid</td><td>+0</td></tr> <tr><td>Reveal unimportant secret</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Give lengthy or complicated aid</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Give dangerous aid</td><td>+10</td></tr> <tr><td>Reveal an important secret</td><td>+10 or more</td></tr> <tr><td>Give aid that could result in punishment</td><td>+15 or more</td></tr> <tr><td>Additional requests</td><td>+5 per request</td></tr> </table>

Action: 1 or more rounds, depending on the complexity of the request.

Try Again: No, though you can make other requests of the same target.

<a href="rules59eb.html?Name=Pass%20Secret%20Messages&amp;Category=Influence%20(Cha)">Pass Secret Messages</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 60</a>
You can use innuendo to pass a hidden message to another character. If you succeed, the target automatically understands you if you're communicating in a language it understands. If you fail by 5 or more, you deliver the wrong message. Other creatures that receive the message can decipher it by succeeding at opposed Perception checks to sense motive (see page 62) against your result. See the discern secret message function of Perception to determine when a secret message is intercepted.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Secret Message</td><td>Influence DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Simple message</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Complex message</td><td>20</td></tr> </table>

Action: Twice as long as it would take to convey the message normally.

Try Again: Yes.
