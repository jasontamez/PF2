Your ability to resist certain effects somehow makes it even harder for creatures you jinx to do the same.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay51bc.html?ItemName=Great%20Fortitude">Great Fortitude</a>, <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, or Lightning Reflexes; Halfling Jinx trait.

Benefit: A jinxed target's penalty on Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saves increases by 2 if you have the Great Fortitude, Lightning Reflexes, or Iron Will feat, respectively. If you have more than one of these feats, the additional penalties apply to all of the corresponding saves.
