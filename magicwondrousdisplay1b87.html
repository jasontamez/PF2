Description

This dapper robe enables a sorcerer to add the effects of her
1st-level bloodline power to spells she casts. As a swift action
before casting a spell, the wearer expends one use of her
1st-level bloodline power and selects one target of the spell
to be affected by that bloodline power. If the spell allows a
saving throw, a successful save against the spell means the
bloodline power deals half damage (if it normally deals hit
point damage) or is negated (if it does not). The robe can be
used up to three times per day.
