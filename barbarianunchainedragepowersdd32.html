Rage Powers - Barbarian (Unchained)









Barbarian (Unchained) Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained</a>
As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the barbarian gains a rage power. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging. Some of these powers are always active during a rage, and others require the barbarian to take an action to use them. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Miscellaneous Rage Powers


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Bestial Flyer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  While raging, the barbarian's fly speed increases by 10 feet and her maneuverability improves by one category. A barbarian must have a fly speed before raging, have the raging flyer power, and be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Boasting Taunt (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 74</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can incite a creature to attack her by making an Intimidate check to demoralize. If the check succeeds, the target is also shaken as long as the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Contagious Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian howls during combat, agitating nearby fauna. Willing animals and magical beasts within 30 feet of the barbarian gain the benefits of the <a href="spelldisplay77eb.html?ItemName=rage">rage</a> spell for as long as she maintains her rage. After the barbarian's rage ends, creatures affected by her rage are fatigued for the same number of rounds as the barbarian. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Disruptive (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 74</a>):  When raging, the barbarian gains <a href="featdisplay26bb.html?ItemName=Disruptive">Disruptive</a> as a bonus feat. The barbarian must have the superstition rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Dissipating Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When the barbarian rages, her feverish frenzy and hot breath burn or blow fog, smoke and similar effects away from her. The barbarian and creatures adjacent to her do not gain concealment from obfuscating effects like fog or precipitation. Magical effects that require more than a strong wind to dissipate are not affected by this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Eclipsing Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  While the barbarian is raging, the light level within 10 feet of her lowers by one step. She can't decrease the light level below normal darkness with this ability. Multiple barbarians with this rage power don't further reduce the light level. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Eclipsing Rage, Greater (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  Whenever the barbarian rages, the light level within 20 feet of her lowers by two steps instead of one. She still can't decrease the light level below normal darkness with this ability. A barbarian must be at least 10th level and have the eclipsing rage- power to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Mount (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount also gains the benefits of rage (including greater rage and mighty rage) as long as the barbarian is mounted or adjacent to it. While her mount is raging in this way, she must spend one additional round of rage per round. She can elect not to pay this cost, in which case her mount does not rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Mount, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the benefits of any rage powers that are constant in effect when the barbarian is raging. It does not gain the benefit of any rage powers that require actions to activate, even if they are free actions. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Flight Response (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures">Horror Adventures pg. 46</a>): When a barbarian with this rage power attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, she can enter a rage as an immediate action (as long as she would normally be able to enter rage). This consumes 3 rounds of the barbarian's daily allotment of rage rounds, but the barbarian can maintain the rage each round on her turn normally. Any benefits from the barbarian's rage apply immediately, so she gains her bonus on Will saves against the effect that required the initial saving throw. Unlike most rage powers, this rage power's effects are useful only when the barbarian is not raging, so a skald can't grant this rage power to allies with raging song.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Furious Draw (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): The barbarian is treated as having the <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a> feat.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Inspire Ferocity (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  While in the reckless stance, the barbarian imparts the stance's bonus and penalty to all willing allies within 30 feet of her. A barbarian must have the reckless stance rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Lizard Stride (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When the barbarian makes a charge or run action while raging, she can move across the surface of water without sinking. She sinks immediately if she ends her turn standing on water.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Low-Light Vision (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian's senses sharpen, and she gains low-light vision.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Master of the Deep (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9pn6?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-the-First-World">Legacy of the First World pg. 29</a>): As a standard action, the barbarian commands an aquatic creature to do her bidding. The barbarian selects a creature with the aquatic type within 30 feet and gives a terse command from those listed in the <a href="spelldisplaye5f6.html?ItemName=command">command</a> spell. Alternatively, if the creature has an Intelligence of 1 or 2, the barbarian may instead command the creature to attack the closest creature to it as a standard action. The creature must succeed at a Will save (DC equal to 10 + half the barbarian's level + her Strength modifier) or obey the command to the best of its ability on its next turn. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against master of the deep (successful or not), it is immune to this power for 24 hours. This ability is a mind-affecting effect, but it is not language dependent; the creature need not understand the barbarian giving the command. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Night Vision (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian's senses grow incredibly sharp, and she gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range of that darkvision increases by 60 feet. A barbarian must have a darkvision racial trait, low-light vision racial trait, or the low-light vision rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>No Escape (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian can move up to double her base speed as an immediate action. She can use this ability only when an adjacent foe uses a withdraw action to move away from her. She must end her movement adjacent to the enemy that used the withdraw action. The barbarian provokes attacks of opportunity as normal during this movement.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Pack Rage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When a barbarian with this rage power enters a rage, any barbarian within 30 feet who also has this rage power can enter a rage. A barbarian that enters a rage outside of her turn spends 1 round of rage immediately and then spends another round of rage to maintain her rage at the beginning of her next turn. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Perfect Clarity (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  While in the calm stance, the barbarian can roll twice for any miss chances or Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions, taking the better result. A barbarian must have the calm stance rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Primal Scent (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  When using her scent rage power, the barbarian adds half her barbarian level on Survival checks made to track by scent and on Perception checks to pinpoint the location of creatures she cannot see. If she pinpoints the location of a creature that has total concealment, she treats it as having concealment. A barbarian must have the scent rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Climber (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  The barbarian gains a climb speed equal to 1/2 her base land speed, taking into account her fast movement class feature. She can't use this climb speed to climb any surface with a DC higher than 20. She also gains a +8 enhancement bonus on Climb checks.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Flyer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus to Fly checks.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Leaper (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  The barbarian is always considered to have a running start when attempting an Acrobatics check to jump. In addition, she gains a +8 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump. Finally, if the barbarian falls, she halves the total distance fallen for the purposes of determining damage taken from the fall.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Swimmer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  The barbarian gains a swim speed equal to 1/2 her base land speed (taking into account her fast movement class feature). She also gains a +8 enhancement bonus on Swim checks.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Whirlwind (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian can create a whirlwind with a powerful spinning move as an immediate action after she confirms a critical hit with a melee attack. The whirlwind circles the target of her melee attack, lifting it in the air slightly until the end of the barbarian's turn. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier) to negate this effect. If it fails the save, the target loses its Dexterity modifier to AC for the rest of the barbarian's turn and lands prone on the ground at the end of her turn. Raging whirlwind has no effect on flying creatures. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Roaring Drunk (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 morale bonus on Intimidate checks and to the save DC of any fear effects she creates for each alcoholic drink she has consumed during her rage, to a maximum of +1 per four barbarian levels.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Roused Anger (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  The barbarian can enter a rage even when fatigued. If the barbarian enters a rage while fatigued, she loses the fatigued condition and she does not gain temporary hit points from rage. Once this rage ends, the barbarian is exhausted for 10 minutes.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Scent (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  The barbarian gains the scent ability.

</tr><tr></td>Suffocating Grip (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9pn6?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-the-First-World">Legacy of the First World pg. 29</a>): While raging, when the barbarian successfully maintains a grapple, she can choke her opponent instead of dealing damage to, moving, pinning, or tying up her opponent. The grappled opponent cannot speak or breathe and must hold its breath or begin suffocating. The grappled opponent can take a breath during any round in which the barbarian does not maintain the grapple. Creatures that do not breathe are not affected by this ability.</td>
