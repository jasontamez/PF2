Mythic Dust of Twilight

A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the sleep spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the lullaby spell).

Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, add half your tier to the level of light spells mythic dust of twilight dispels.
