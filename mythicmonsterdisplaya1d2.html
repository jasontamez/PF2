The First Owlbear

This owlbear seems lean and especially mean, and moves with a spookily silent grace.

Description

Though created long ago, the very first owlbear still lives. Fecund, nomadic and cantankerous, the First Owlbear's offspring are always owlbears, whether the mother is a bear, a giant owl, or an owlbear. He brings his "harem" of mates with him when he hunts, driving them off when he tires of their company or food becomes scarce.
