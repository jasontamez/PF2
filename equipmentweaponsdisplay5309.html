Description

This one-handed axe is small and perfectly balanced for throwing, and can be used as a melee weapon. Throwing axes have a variety of alternative names, including franciscas, tomahawks, and more. The axe is normally gripped by the haft and thrown overhand, making one complete rotation in the air before biting into the target with the axe head.
