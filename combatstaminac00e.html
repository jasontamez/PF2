You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. You can spend 5 stamina points to use Second Chance to reroll any attack after the first in a full attack at the same bonus. If you use Second Chance more than once in the same full attack, the penalties stack.
