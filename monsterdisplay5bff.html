Scarlet Walker

This crimson horror walks upon six long, thin legs. Its face is
neither that of a skull nor spider, but some horrid mix of the two.

Special Abilities

Blood-Draining Gaze (Su) All creatures within 20 feet of a scarlet
walker are subject to the monster's eerie blood-draining gaze.
Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or
thin streams of blood pour from their eyes, flowing through the
air and into the eye socket-like pits in the scarlet walker's face.
This does not impact the victim's vision, but does deal 1 point
of Constitution damage and sickens the victim for 1 round from
the hideous pain. A creature already suffering from a bleed
effect takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw. This is a bleed
effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.


Bloodsense (Su) A scarlet walker can sense living creatures
with blood in their veins, or undead creatures that feed on
blood (such as vampires). This ability functions like blindsight
to a range of 60 feet.


Description

The scarlet walker is an alien entity
from some other dimension,
often conjured by the wizards
of Thassilon to serve as
a minion. Scarlet walkers
were particularly favored for
their adeptness at interrogating
prisoners, either via torture, or via the
creatures' uncanny ability to mentally
compel both actions and compliance. Once
an interrogation was over, the scarlet walker's
master typically commanded the monster to
render the victim insane or feebleminded if mere
death wasn't appropriate.


Scarlet walkers themselves
hail from the nightmare
realm of Leng, where they
walk amid strange, stony
deserts and stride through the
skies above. No mere predators,
scarlet walkers build immense hives of
coagulated blood and tissue in nameless
mountain valleys, and the flavors of various creatures-
blood is an inexhaustible topic of discussion among
their kind.
