Description

This elongated bull's horn curves sharply at the end,
almost making it seem more like an enormous smoking
pipe than a tool for the hunt. Once each day, a person with
the hunter's bond (companions) class feature may blow
the horn as a standard action; this grants his full favored
enemy bonus (instead of half) against a single target to all
allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The effect
lasts for 1 minute.
