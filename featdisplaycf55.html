Unlike many goblins, you're not particularly afraid of dogs. You know what dogs smell like, and that smell makes you mad-very mad.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Perception)</a>, goblin.

Benefit:  You gain the scent ability, but only against canines (including dogs, goblin dogs, wolves, worgs, yeth hounds, and any similar creatures, subject to GM approval). Against these creatures, you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 morale bonus on weapon damage rolls.
