Growing up in the harsh tundra, you could rarely rely on anyone other than yourself. Solitude has only made you stronger as you overcame insurmountable odds.

Prerequisites: Str 17, base attack bonus +4, half-orc.

Benefit: As a free action when you have no conscious allies within 30 feet of you, you can call upon your solitary prowess to enter a focused state. While in this state, your melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. You can remain in this state for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
