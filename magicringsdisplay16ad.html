Description

This spiraling silver ring glows briefly when a living creature puts it on. If its wearer of a ring of the faithful dead is slain by a creature with the create spawn ability, the wearer does not rise as an undead creature, even if the ring is later removed. If a corpse is wearing a ring of the faithful dead, any attempts to create an undead creature from the corpse (such as via animate dead) automatically fail, though simply removing the ring ends this protection.
