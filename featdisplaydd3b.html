Particularly old or powerful bunyips have ear-piercing cries that instill terror into those near and far.

Prerequisites: Con 17, bunyip, roar special attack.

Benefit:  The bunyip's roar ability is enhanced so that it affects all hearing creatures with 8 or fewer Hit Dice within a 200-foot spread. The ability is otherwise unchanged. A bunyip is immune to the effects of its own roar.

Normal:  A bunyip's roar ability affects all hearing creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice within a 100-foot spread.
