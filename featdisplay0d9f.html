You're able to dodge attacks with increased panache.

Prerequisites: Dodging panache deed, swashbuckler level 3rd.

Benefit: When you use the dodging panache deed, the movement granted by that deed does not provoke attacks of opportunity from any creature, and you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your Armor Class.
