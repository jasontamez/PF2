This section addresses how to turn a non-mythic monster into a mythic monster and how to create an entirely new mythic creature. Just as characters' abilities depend on their mythic tier, monsters' abilities depend on their mythic rank (MR), with a higher rank meaning a creature has additional mythic abilities.

<a href="rulesffd1.html?Name=Mythic%20Simple%20Templates&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">Mythic Simple Templates</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 224</a>
The following simple templates can be used to turn any monster into a mythic creature. A creature given one of these templates counts as a mythic creature for the purposes of spells, abilities, and magic items even though it doesn't have the mythic subtype (see page 226). Note that because it doesn't have the mythic subtype, it doesn't gain the many benefits of having the mythic subtype-the creature only gains the benefits described in the simple template.



Mythic Bonus Hit Points

A creature with one of the mythic templates listed below gains additional hit points according to its Hit Die type. A creature with d6 Hit Dice gains 6 hit points per mythic rank, a creature with d8 Hit Dice gains 8 hit points per rank, and a creature with d10 or d12 Hit Dice gains 10 hit points per rank.



Agile (MR 1, CR +1)

Creatures with the agile template are quick and deadly, moving faster than their normal counterparts and striking with incredible speed and agility. An agile creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: Init +20 bonus; AC +2 dodge bonus; hp mythic bonus hit points; Defensive Abilities evasion (as the <a href="classdisplay8ec3.html?ItemName=Rogue">rogue class feature</a>); Speed +30 feet for all movement types (up to double the creature's base movement speed); Special Attacks <a href="rulesb7ab.html?Name=New%20Universal%20Monster%20Rules&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">dual initiative</a>.

Arcane (MR 1 or 2 , CR +1)

Creatures with the arcane template are infused with arcane power, capable of casting a limited number of arcane spells. If the creature has 11 or more Hit Dice, this simple template grants a mythic rank of 2 instead of 1. An arcane creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: AC +2 deflection bonus; hp mythic bonus hit points; SR gains SR equal to its new CR + 11; Special Attacks <a href="rulesb7ab.html?Name=New%20Universal%20Monster%20Rules&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">mythic magic, simple arcane casting</a>.



Divine (MR 1 or 2 , CR +1)

Creatures with the divine template can call upon the power of the gods, allowing them to cast a limited number of divine spells. If the creature has 11 or more Hit Dice, this simple template grants a mythic rank of 2 instead of 1. A divine creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: Aura aura of grace (creature and all allies within 10 feet receive a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws-or a profane bonus if the templated creature is evil); AC +2 deflection bonus; hp mythic bonus hit points; Special Attacks <a href="rulesb7ab.html?Name=New%20Universal%20Monster%20Rules&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">mythic magic, simple divine spellcasting</a>.



Invincible (MR 1 or 2, CR +1)

Creatures with the invincible template are incredibly difficult to harm. They can withstand immense punishment and continue to fight. If the creature has 11 or more Hit Dice, this simple template grants a mythic rank of 2 instead of 1. An invincible creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: AC increase natural armor bonus by 2 (or 4 if the creature has 11 or more Hit Dice); hp mythic bonus hit points; Defensive Abilities gains DR and resistance to all types of energy as per Table 6-3, as well as <a href="rulesb7ab.html?Name=New%20Universal%20Monster%20Rules&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">block attacks</a> and <a href="rulesb7ab.html?Name=New%20Universal%20Monster%20Rules&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">second save</a>.

Savage (MR 1 or 2, CR +1)

Creatures with the savage template are untamed, primordial versions of their non-mythic cousins. Their claws are sharper, their fangs larger, and their hides thicker. If the creature has 11 or more Hit Dice, this simple template grants a mythic rank of 2 instead of 1. A savage creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: AC increase natural armor bonus by 2; hp mythic bonus hit points; Defensive Abilities gains DR and resistance to all types of energy as per Table 6-4; Special Attacks all attacks gain bleed 1 (this stacks with itself ), <a href="rulesb7ab.html?Name=New%20Universal%20Monster%20Rules&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">feral savagery (full attack)</a>.

In addition to using a mythic simple template, there are two ways to create a new mythic monster. The first is to take an existing monster, give it the mythic subtype, and add abilities as described in that subtype. The second method is to create an entirely new monster with the mythic subtype and incorporate additional abilities into the final monster. Both methods are described beginning on page 225.

<a href="rules36df.html?Name=Mythic%20Subtype&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">Mythic Subtype</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 226</a>
A creature with this subtype is infused with mythic power and is capable of terrible and awe-inspiring feats. Creatures with the mythic subtype gain the following abilities.

Mythic Rank: A creature with the mythic subtype gains 1 to 10 mythic ranks, representing its overall mythic power. Its rank is generally equal to 1/2 its original CR.

Natural Armor Bonus: Add the creature's mythic rank to its natural armor bonus. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.

Bonus Hit Points: A creature with d6 Hit Dice gains 6 hit points per mythic rank, a creature with d8 Hit Dice gains 8 hit points per rank, and a creature with d10 or d12 Hit Dice gains 10 hit points per rank. Note that this is the same number of bonus hit points the creature would gain if it had a <a href="rulesffd1.html?Name=Mythic%20Simple%20Templates&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">mythic simple template</a>.

Damage Reduction: A creature with 5 to 10 Hit Dice gains DR 5/epic. A creature with 11 or more Hit Dice gains DR 10/epic.

If the creature already has damage reduction, it adds epic to the qualities needed to bypass that reduction. If the damage reduction granted from this subtype has a larger numerical value than the creature's original damage reduction, increase the creature's original damage reduction to the amount of the epic DR. For example, a monster with DR 5/bludgeoning that gains DR 10/epic from the mythic subtype gains DR 10/bludgeoning and epic.

Spell Resistance: If the creature has spell resistance, add its mythic rank to its spell resistance.

Mythic Power: The creature gains the <a href="rulesb7ab.html?Name=New%20Universal%20Monster%20Rules&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">mythic power and surge universal monster abilities</a>. The monster's surge die depends on its rank, as summarized in Table 6-5: Mythic Subtype Abilities.

Ability Bonus: At 2nd rank and every 2 ranks thereafter, the monster gains a permanent +2 bonus to an ability score. If it has multiple bonuses, it can apply them to the same ability score or to different ability scores.

Mythic Feats: At 1st rank and every 2 ranks thereafter, the monster gains a mythic feat. It must meet all of the prerequisites for this feat.

Additional Mythic Abilities: The monster gains a number of mythic abilities equal to its MR + 1. Such abilities can be drawn from the mythic path abilities in Chapter 1 or the mythic abilities listed with the monsters in this chapter, or it can be a new ability you create by taking inspiration from those abilities. These abilities should be thematically appropriate for the creature.

Some new monster abilities are especially powerful; at the GM's discretion, they can count as two abilities toward this total. For example, the <a href="mythicmonsterdisplay5015.html?ItemName=Fire%20Giant">mythic fire giant's</a> fire vortex ability could count as two mythic abilities. In place of a mythic ability, the monster may gain a universal monster ability, such as rend or pounce, either from an existing Bestiary or from this book.



CR: When you're finished adding abilities to the monster, add 1/2 the monster's mythic rank to its CR to determine its new CR. Evaluate the monster at its new CR using <a href="rulesdb89.html?Name=Evaluating%20Monster%20Statistics&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monster%20Advancement">Table 6-8: Monster Statistics by CR</a> to make sure it falls within the expected values for its new CR.

XP: Change the creature's <a href="rules3a7b.html?Name=Awarding%20Experience&amp;Category=Building%20an%20Adventure">XP award to match its new CR</a>.

Like the universal monster rules in the Bestiary, the following rules are referenced (but not repeated) in mythic monster stat blocks. Each rule includes a format guide for how it appears in a monster's listing and its location in the stat block.

Block Attacks (Ex): Once per round, when the creature is hit by a melee or ranged attack, it can attempt a melee attack using its highest attack bonus. If this result exceeds the result from the attack against it, the creature is unaffected by the attack (as if the attack had missed).
Format: block attacks; Location: Defensive Abilities.

Dragon Blood (Su): The mythic dragon's blood and other fluids are infused with acid, cold, electricity, or fire, matching the dragon's breath weapon energy type. Every time the dragon is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes energy damage according to Table 6-6: Dragon Blood Damage (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the dragon has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.



Table 6-6: Dragon Blood Damage

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Dragon Size</td><td>Points of Energy Damage</td></tr><tr><td>Medium or smaller</td><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>2d8</td></tr></table>
Format: dragon blood (2d6 fire); Location: Defensive Abilities.

Dragon Cantrips (Su): If the mythic dragon is able to cast arcane spells, it automatically knows all cantrips for its equivalent spellcasting class and can cast them at will.
Format: dragon cantrips; Location: SQ.

Dragon Fury (Su): If a mythic dragon confirms a critical hit with a natural weapon, it adds its dragon blood damage to the damage dealt by the natural attack.
Format: dragon fury (1d6 fire); Location: Special Attacks.

Dual Initiative (Ex): The monster gets two turns each round, one on its initiative count and another on its initiative count - 20. For example, if the monster's initiative is 23, for its first turn it could make a full attack (and take a 5 foot step) at initiative 23, and for its second turn at initiative 3 it could take a move action and cast a spell. This allows the monster to perform two actions per round that normally take an entire round, such as using a <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a> spell. For the purposes of spells and effects that have a duration of a round or longer or trigger at the beginning of the creature's round or the start of its turn such as saving throws against ongoing effects or taking bleed damage), only the monster's first turn each round counts toward such durations.
Format: +21/+1; Location: Initiative.

Feral Savagery (Su): Under the circumstances listed in the monster's stat block'such as when it makes a full attack or a rend attack-it can immediately attempt an additional attack against an opponent. This attack is made using the creature's full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. This additional attack doesn't stack with similar means of gaining additional attacks, such as the haste spell or a speed weapon. This ability doesn't grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.
Format: feral savagery (full attack); Location: special attacks.

Fortification (Ex): The monster has an 50% chance to treat any critical hit or sneak attack as a normal hit, as if wearing <a href="magicarmordisplaya46e.html?ItemName=Fortification%20(moderate)">moderate fortification</a> armor.
Format: fortification (50%); Location: Defensive Abilities.

Greensight (Su): The monster can see through thick plant matter as though it were transparent, usually with a range of 60 feet. Leaves, vines, greenery, and undergrowth offer no concealment to the monster's sight, though solid wood still blocks its line of sight.
Format: greensight 60 ft.; Location: Senses.

Lingering Breath (Su): The creature can expend one use of mythic power as a free action when it uses its breath weapon to make the area radiate energy damage (of the same type as the breath weapon) for 1 round per mythic rank. Any creature in, entering, or passing through the breath weapon's area during this duration takes damage according to the creature's size. This ability has no effect on breath weapons that do not deal energy damage.
Format: lingering breath (2d6 fire, 5 rounds); Location: Special Attacks.



Table 6-7: Lingering Breath Damage

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Creature Size</td><td>Points of Energy Damage</td></tr><tr><td>Medium or smaller</td><td>2d4</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>4d6</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>4d8</td></tr></table>

Mistsight (Ex): The monster can see through fog, mist, and murky water as if they were perfectly clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.
Format: mistsight; Location: Senses.

Mythic Magic (Su): Up to three times per day, when the creature casts a spell, it can cast the mythic version instead (as with all mythic spells, the creature must expend mythic power to cast a mythic spell in this way).
Format: mythic magic 3/day; Location: Special Attacks.

Mythic Power (Su): The mythic monster can draw upon a wellspring of power to accomplish amazing deeds and cheat fate. Each day, it can expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to its mythic rank. This amount is its maximum amount of mythic power. If an ability allows it to regain mythic power, it can never gain more than this amount. The monster automatically has the surge ability, and can use this mythic power to activate it. It may have other abilities that rely on mythic power.
Format: mythic power (3/day, surge +1d6); Location: Special Attacks.

Poisonous Blood (Ex): Any creature that confirms a critical hit against the monster with a piercing or slashing melee weapon is sprayed with poison. (Melee weapons with reach don't endanger their users in this way.) The type of poison depends on the monster. Unless otherwise stated, this poison uses the poison's normal DC, though some monsters might have a poison DC that's Constitution-based.
Format: poisonous blood (dragon bile); Location: Defensive Abilities.

Powerful Blows (Ex): The specified attack adds 1-1/2 times the creature's Strength bonus on damage rolls instead of its normal Strength bonus or half its Strength bonus.
Format: powerful blows (slam); Location: SQ.

Sand Glide (Ex): This ability functions like the <a href="monsterdisplayc02c.html?ItemName=Small%20Earth%20Elemental">earth elemental's earth glide ability</a>, but works only on sand, dirt, and other fine-grained solid matter. The creature's speed using sand glide as the same as its base speed.
Format: sand glide; Location: Speed.

Second Save (Ex): Whenever the creature fails a saving throw against an effect with a duration greater than 1 round, it can keep trying to shake off the effect. At the start of its turn, if it's still affected, it can attempt the save one more time as a free action. If this save succeeds, the effect affects the creature as if it had succeeded at its initial saving throw. If the effect already allows another saving throw on a later turn to break the effect (such as for hold monster), this ability is in addition to the extra saving throw from the effect.
Format: second save; Location: after saving throws.

Simple Arcane Spellcasting: The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the <a href="spellsb18c.html?Class=Sorcerer">sorcerer/wizard spell list</a>. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses the higher of its Intelligence or Charisma modifiers to determine its spell DCs.
Format: simple arcane spellcasting; Location: Special Attacks.

Simple Divine Spellcasting: The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the <a href="spells1fc9.html?Class=Cleric">cleric</a> or <a href="spellsa2e5.html?Class=Druid">druid</a> spell list. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses its Wisdom or Charisma (whichever is higher) to determine its spell DCs.
Format: simple divine spellcasting; Location: Special Attacks.

Smother (Ex): If the creature's grappled opponent is holding its breath, the monster can force that opponent to expel or consume some of its breath, or can otherwise reduce the time remaining until the target has to attempt checks to avoid <a href="rules70f3.html?Name=Suffocation&amp;Category=Environmental%20Rules">suffocation</a>.

If the monster succeeds at a grapple check against the opponent, the remaining duration for which the opponent can hold its breath decreases by 1d6 rounds. If this reduces the remaining time that the creature can hold its breath to 0 rounds or fewer, the DCs of its suffocation checks increase by 5. For example, if the monster is grappling a creature that has 10 rounds remaining before it has to attempt suffocation checks, a successful grapple check reduces that duration by 1d6 rounds.

If the monster has another ability (such as constrict) that harms the opponent when it succeeds at a grapple check, it can automatically use the smother ability when it succeeds at the grapple check to use the other ability.
Format: smother; Location: Special Attacks.

Steal (Ex): The creature can attempt a <a href="rulesc1ab.html?Name=Steal&amp;Category=Combat%20Maneuvers">steal combat maneuver</a> against its opponent as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity if it hits with the specified attack.
Format: steal; Location: individual attacks.

Surge (Su): The monster can call upon its mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. It can expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll it just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the original roll is made and the results are revealed. The bonus die gained by using this ability increases to 1d8 at 4th rank, 1d10 at 7th rank, and 1d12 at 10th rank. The monster can use this ability even if it's mindless or of animal-level intelligence.

Surge doesn't have a separate entry in the monster stat block-the surge die is listed in the mythic power ability.

X-Ray Vision (Su): The monster can see through solid matter as if wearing a <a href="magicringsdisplay59c5.html?FinalName=Ring%20of%20X-Ray%20Vision">ring of x-ray vision</a>. This is as exhausting as if the monster were actually using the ring.
Format: x-ray vision; Location: Senses.

Table 6-8: Monster Statistics by CR is an expansion of the table of the same name on page 291 of the Bestiary, listing approximate statistics for monsters up to CR 30 (the information for CR 1-20 is identical to that presented in the Bestiary). These values are rough guidelines. You'll notice that many of the existing monsters in this book don't follow these guidelines exactly. Most monsters excel in one of these areas (usually in the amount of damage dealt), but lag in one or two other areas to balance them out. For example, a monster might have higher damage than what's listed in the table, but have a lower AC and hit points. The entries on the table are as follows.

CR: This is the approximate CR of the monster. This number might change as the design progresses.

Hit Points: This is the approximate hit point total for the monster. A creature with a particularly high AC, especially large saving throw bonuses, or a number of resistances might have a lower number. Outsiders and constructs typically have lower hit point totals.

Armor Class: This is the average AC for a creature of this CR. When it comes time to design the creature's protections, keep this number in mind. Creatures whose hit point totals are above average typically have lower AC to compensate.

High Attack: This is the average total attack bonus for a creature of this CR that is primarily a melee or ranged combatant. Creatures with a higher than normal average damage typically have a lower attack value to compensate.

Low Attack: This is the average total attack bonus for a creature of this CR that doesn't rely upon melee or ranged attacks to deal damage. This includes most creatures that mainly use spells and spell-like abilities in combat.

Average Damage: This is the average amount of damage dealt by a creature of this CR if all of its attacks are successful. To determine a creature's average damage, add the average value for all of the damage dice rolled (as determined by Table 1-5: Average Die Results on page 293 of the Bestiary) to the damage modifier for each attack.

A creature that relies on melee or ranged weapons in combat should have average damage within the range of high and low damage.

A creature with higher than normal attack bonuses often deals less damage, and a creature with lower than normal attack bonuses often deals more damage.

Primary Ability DC: This is the average difficulty class (DC) for any spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities (such as breath weapons) possessed by a creature of this CR that relies on such attacks in combat. If an ability is particularly powerful, it might have a lower DC to compensate for that.

Secondary Ability DC: This is the average DC for spells and special abilities for a creature that does not rely on such attacks in combat. Generally, an ability's DC should not be lower than this number.

Good Save: This is the average saving throw bonus for a creature of this CR, if the saving throw is one of the creature's good saving throws.

Poor Save: This is the average saving throw bonus for a creature of this CR, if the saving throw is one of the creature's poor saving throws.
