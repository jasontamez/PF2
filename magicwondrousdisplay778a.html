Description

This blown-glass vial has a chain for attaching
it to the handle of a weapon. When filled with
the wearer's blood, it gains powerful magic.
Filling the reservoir takes a full minute, deals
4 points of Constitution damage (which
can be healed normally), and imbues the
reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the reservoir changes the
blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with time.


The wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or
more charges from the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability
score damage per charge used.


The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue
herself with a great burst of physical prowess, depleting all
remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus to one physical
ability score equal to twice the number of charges used. This
bonus lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn.


The bearer can only use the reservoir if it is held in hand or
attached to a held or wielded weapon. A bearer can safely carry
only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously
drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highestcharged
reservoir intact. A reservoir has no effect if not charged
with the wearer's blood, and cannot be charged by bloodless
creatures or those that cannot take Constitution damage.
