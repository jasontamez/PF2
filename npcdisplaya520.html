Tactics

Before Combat The barbarian uses his warhorse for transportation, but if expecting combat, he retrieves an animal from his bag of tricks and rides it instead.
During Combat The barbarian charges whenever possible, whether mounted or on foot, using Mounted Combat and his +1 arrow catching buckler to divert attacks made against his mount. If his mount is slain, he draws a replacement from his bag of tricks and makes a fast mount. He uses guarded stance and rolling dodge as needed, often using them or renewed vigor after a ride-by charge while circling around into position for another charge.

Savage riders use a mix of magical and mundane mounts to make lightning-fast raids against their enemies.

Finnogh Llew

Having mastered horses while still a child, Finnogh seeks out the wildest and most untameable beasts the world has to offer. Though he's keenly interested in learning which savage beasts can best be tamed, he cares less about mastery than the thrill of the ride. Eventually he turns loose even those animals he has broken to the bit, though more from boredom than altruism.

Combat Encounters: Always on the search for exotic beasts to serve as mounts, Finnogh often resides in or near the lairs of strange creatures.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Finnogh is quick to query adventurers about any strange creatures they might have encountered, and may join them on a hunt for such beasts.
