While the Leadership feat excels at granting the widest variety of cohorts and followers, there are a number of other ways is which you can introduce Leadership into your campaign. The following are a few different forms of Leadership, most of which can be taken at a lower level and then upgraded to the full Leadership feat at some later point in the campaign, if so desired. All of the variant feats in this section are optional, and Vile Leadership is suited only for evil characters. A player should get her GM's permission before selecting any of these feats. <ul><li><a href="featdisplay8e49.html?ItemName=Groom">Groom</a></li> <li><a href="featdisplayea6b.html?ItemName=Light%20Bearer">Light Bearer</a></li> <li><a href="featdisplay784f.html?ItemName=Page">Page</a></li> <li><a href="featdisplayead5.html?ItemName=Recruits">Recruits</a></li> <li><a href="featdisplay01eb.html?ItemName=Vile%20Leadership">Vile Leadership</a></li> <li><a href="featdisplay050c.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Bearer">Weapon Bearer</a></li></ul>
