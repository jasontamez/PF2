The rules presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for underwater combat apply to creatures not native to this dangerous environment, such as most PCs. For extended aquatic adventures or for particularly deep explorations, PCs will doubtless need to use magic to continue their adventures. <a href="spelldisplaybb52.html?ItemName=Water%20breathing">Water breathing</a> is of obvious use, while <a href="spelldisplay2b11.html?ItemName=endure%20elements">endure elements</a> can help with temperature. Pressure damage can be avoided entirely with effects such as <a href="spelldisplayd71b.html?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement">freedom of movement</a>. Polymorph spells are perhaps the most useful in water, though, if the form assumed is aquatic in nature.

Natural Adaptation: Any creature that has the aquatic subtype can breathe water easily and is unaffected by water temperature extremes that are found in that creature's typical environment. Aquatic creatures and creatures with the hold breath ability are much more resistant to pressure damage; they do not suffer damage from pressure unless they are moved instantaneously from one depth to another in the blink of an eye (in which case they adapt to the pressure change after successfully making five successive Fortitude saves against the pressure effects).
