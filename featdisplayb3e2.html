The Fire God rewards you for killing enemies with flame.

Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, worshiper of the Fire God.

Benefit: When in combat, if you deal fire damage to an enemy, you heal 1 hit point. You can only benefit from this healing once per round. Attacks that cause a target to catch on fire heal you each round the target takes fire damage.
