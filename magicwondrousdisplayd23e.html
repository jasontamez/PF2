Description

This large pirate hat bears a skull-and-crossbones on the front. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks.

If Besmara is the wearer's patron, the wearer automatically floats to the surface of any body of water (at a speed of 30 feet) unless she desires otherwise; this does not prevent the wearer from falling safely into water or interacting with water in any other way.
