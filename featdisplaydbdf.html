Your confident attacks leave your foes wavering and unable to regain their composure.

Prerequisites: Int 13; Amateur Swashbuckler or panache class feature; <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>; <a href="featdisplay9292.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirty%20Trick">Improved Dirty Trick.</a>

Benefit:  When you attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check and expend 1 point of panache, if the maneuver is successful, your opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier) to remove its dirty trick condition.
