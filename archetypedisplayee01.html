Antiquarians are collectors, explorers, and scholars who delve into ruined places in search of lost lore and artifacts.

Relic Magic (Su): Antiquarians emulate Arustun, founder of the Jistka Imperium, by exploring and recording the remnants of lost civilizations. Rather than using extracts, an antiquarian carries a collection of holy and unholy symbols, charms, and trinkets. Though an antiquarian may never know who or what grants him his power, he can produce magical effects all the same. Relic magic functions as the alchemy class feature, except as noted below.

An antiquarian begins play with a collection of religious trinkets that functions as his formula book and weighs 2 pounds total, with each trinket functioning as a formula. Adding new trinkets has the same cost and time requirement as adding formulae to a formula book. An antiquarian can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's formula book to learn formulae, but an antiquarian's trinket collection is too esoteric for anyone except another antiquarian to learn spells from. An antiquarian prepares spells by meditating and charging relics with supernatural power, which has the same requirements and limitations as preparing extracts. However, instead of creating extracts, an antiquarian casts spells as though he were an arcane spellcaster, which means he can affect other creatures with his spells. An antiquarian does not suffer from arcane spell failure.

An antiquarian doesn't gain a competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks to create alchemical items, and he cannot identify potions with that skill. Furthermore, he cannot select alchemist discoveries as investigator talents.

This alters alchemy.

Item Lore (Ex): An antiquarian can identify even the most esoteric objects at a glance. At 2nd level, he can discern whether an item is magical simply by studying it for 1 round. Once he identifies a magic item in this way, he can use Spellcraft to attempt to identify the properties of the magic item as if he had used detect magic. Furthermore, he can detect whether an item is cursed if his check to identify the magic item exceeds the DC by 5.

This replaces poison lore.

Curse Resistance (Ex): At 2nd level, an antiquarian gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and effects with the curse descriptor. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, the antiquarian becomes completely immune to such effects.

This replaces poison resistance and poison immunity.

Swift Search (Ex): At 4th level, an antiquarian can study the secrets of a location with incredible speed. Whenever he takes 20 on a Perception check, it takes him only 1 minute.

This replaces swift alchemy.
