Your martial training helps you move with acrobatic poise.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay11fe.html?ItemName=Owl%20Style">Owl Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Stealth)</a>, Acrobatics 1 rank, Stealth 1 rank.

Benefit: While using Owl Style, you can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Acrobatics to determine your Acrobatics skill bonus. You can attempt Acrobatics checks to move on narrow or slick surfaces and to avoid attacks of opportunity while charging, incurring the same penalties and increased DCs that you usually would apply for moving at full speed.
