Description

These thin, elegant adamantine tools are inscribed with numerous runes in the four elemental languages (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran). These tools grant a user the skill to imbue gems with elemental power during the cutting process. In addition, they act as masterwork artisan's tools for the Craft (jewelry) skill.

The user of these tools can attempt to craft elemental gems (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 511). Creating an elemental gem requires 8 total hours of work and an uncut gem worth 1,000 gp. The user must succeed at a DC 21 Craft (jewelry) check or the process fails and the raw materials are ruined. The user must speak the appropriate elemental language to use the elementalist's tools to craft an elemental gem of a specific element. Although the user doesn't need to meet any of the prerequisites for crafting elemental gems, this process otherwise follows the normal rules for magic item creation.
