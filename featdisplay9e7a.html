Your attention to detail provides you with an excess of
some commodities, at the cost of others.


Benefit:  You excel at performing skilled work for a
certain type of capital, but are less adept at generating
another type of capital (see page 78 of Ultimate Campaign).
Choose one of the following types of capital to be your
focus capital: Goods, Inf luence, Labor, or Magic.
Whenever you spend downtime to perform skilled work
to gain focus capital, you gain half again the normal
amount (rounded down). However, you must also choose
a second, separate type of capital from the same list to be
your neglected capital. Whenever you spend downtime to
perform skilled work to gain neglected capital, you gain
only half the amount you normally would. This feat only
affects capital you gain by performing skilled work, not
capital you might gain by performing unskilled work,
purchasing capital, or running a business.

For example, say you chose Goods as your focus capital
and Magic as your neglected capital. If you spent a day
performing skilled work to gain Goods, and the result of
your Sleight of Hands skill check is a 33, you would gain 4
Goods (rather than the usual 3 for a result of 30 or higher).
However, if you were to spend the following day using
your Spellcraft check to perform skilled work and again
got a result of 33, you would only gain 2 Magic rather than
the usual 3.


Special:  You may take this feat twice. The second time,
you must choose the other two types of capital to be a
focus and a neglected capital.
