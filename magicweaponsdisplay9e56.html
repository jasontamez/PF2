Description

This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. Once per day as a free action, the wielder of a sneaky weapon can designate a single foe within his melee reach as his prey. If the wielder has the sneak attack class feature, he adds his sneak attack damage to the next attack he makes against his prey, even if the wielder is not flanking and the target is not denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, as long as that attack is made before the end of the wielder's next turn. If the wielder is a rogue or slayer with the hunter's surprise talent, he can use that talent one additional time per day.
