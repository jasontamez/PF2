You are adept at the one-handed grab.

Prerequisites: Improved Grapple; base attack bonus +6, brawler's flurry class feature, or flurry of blows class feature.

Benefit:  When you use this style, you do not take a -4 penalty on combat maneuver checks to grapple a foe with only one hand. Additionally, you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while pinning an opponent.

Normal:  Without two hands free, you take a -4 penalty on the combat maneuver roll to grapple a foe. While pinning a foe, you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.
