You have a close connection with a spiritual assistant capable of aiding you in small ways.

Prerequisites: Caster Level 8th.

Benefit: You gain the assistance of an invisible shapeless spirit. This acts as a constant unseen servant spell, using your character level as your effective caster level. For every 4 character levels you have, the spirit ally's effective Strength score increases by 2 (to a maximum of 12 at 20th level). If the spirit ally dissipates or is dispelled, it returns after 24 hours.
