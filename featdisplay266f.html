You can use your whip like a wyvern's sting, forcing foes to give it their undivided attention.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (whip)</a>, <a href="featdisplay4651.html?ItemName=Wyvern%20Fury%20Style">Wyvern Fury Style</a>, Acrobatics 6 ranks, brawler's flurry class feature or flurry of blows class feature.

Benefit: While using Wyvern Fury Style, if you successfully attack a foe with a whip or scorpion whip, as a swift action you can choose one ally. Until the beginning of your next turn, that ally can leave spaces threatened by that foe without provoking an attack of opportunity from the foe.
