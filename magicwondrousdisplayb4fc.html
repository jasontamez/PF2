Description

Even though this translucent, 1-foot-long candle resembles an icicle, it refuses to melt when exposed to any normal heat source. When lit, the candle transmutes its material composition from wax into gleaming divine ice (frozen holy water like that produced by holy ice). The flame of the candle is cool and radiates violet-blue light. Lighting the candle is a standard action, and anyone adjacent to it can extinguish the flame as a free action. The candle can burn for 10 rounds (need not be consecutive) before the ice is entirely consumed.

While the candle is burning, it emits an aura of divine cold in a 30-foot radius. The candle modifies the effect of any channeled positive or negative energy that originates inside the aura, and of any cure or inflict spell cast inside the aura. Instead of their normal effects, these abilities deal an amount of cold damage equal to the number of hit points they would normally cure or inflict. A target that succeeds at a Fortitude save (using the normal DC for the ability or spell) instead takes half damage.

A bearer can hurl the lit candle at an enemy as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet, causing the candle to explode into a burst of chilled holy water. A creature struck in this manner is numbed by divine cold, becoming staggered for half the remaining time that the candle could burn (Fortitude DC 17 negates). An undead creature or evil outsider struck in this manner also takes 1d4 points of damage for each remaining round that the candle could continue burning, as if it were hit by holy water (no saving throw).
