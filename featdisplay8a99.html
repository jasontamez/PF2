You have seen the outer reaches of the multiverse, and have gleaned knowledge from these alien realms. You have a special affinity for one of these realms in particular, and carry some of that plane's power within you.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 11 ranks, ability to cast plane shift or gate as a spell or spell-like ability.

Benefit:  Choose one of the planes below. The alignment of the plane must be within one step of your alignment. You gain a +2 bonus on saves against spells and spell-like abilities with the associated descriptor, and you cast spells with that descriptor at +1 caster level.
