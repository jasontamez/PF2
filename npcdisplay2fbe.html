Often whimsical in their destruction, chaos arrows roam the world playing the cruelest pranks for their own twisted amusement.

Tris Darkjester

It's said that even a few demons that have crossed Tris's path found her a little too malicious for their taste. The gnome's odd looks hide the heart of a capricious and sadistic killer. She enjoys watching other creatures die, burning in arcane fire or crackling and freezing from the energy of her dangerous bow.

Combat Encounters: Tris often strikes without any clear reason or purpose. She does it just to feed her morbid sense of fun, or to see if she can find a new way to murder.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Though she doesn't like to be, Tris can be patient. She sometimes joins a group of adventurers on some quest or another just to see how she can subtly bring about the demise of a few members before they find her out and she can slay them with impunity.
