Description

This ruby is cut like a droplet of blood and suspended on an elaborate golden necklace. Once per day as a swift action, the wearer can envenom a wielded weapon with her saliva or blood as though she were a vishkanya (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 208). The wearer must be injured to use her blood with this ability, but can voluntarily deal 1 point of damage to herself with piercing or slashing weapon in order to use it.

If the wearer is a vishkanya, she can use her toxic racial trait two additional times per day, and the DC of saving throws against her venom increases by 1.
