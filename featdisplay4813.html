Your sensitive twisting movements make you difficult to anticipate combat.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b69-3.html?ItemName=Snake%20Style">Snake Style</a>, Acrobatics 3 ranks, Sense Motive 6 ranks.

Benefit:  You gain a +4 bonus to CMD against trip combat maneuvers and on Acrobatics checks and saving throws to avoid being knocked prone. While using the Snake Style feat, whenever you score a critical threat with your unarmed strike, you can make a Sense Motive check in place of the attack roll to confirm the critical hit. Whenever you score a critical hit with your unarmed strike, you can spend an immediate action to take a 5-foot step even if you have otherwise moved this round.

Normal:  You can take a 5-foot step only if you have not otherwise moved this round.
