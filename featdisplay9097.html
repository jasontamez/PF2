Your critical hits mute your enemies. Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, the victim is unable to speak for 1d4+1 rounds. This prevents spellcasters from using spells with verbal components. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this muteness to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus.
