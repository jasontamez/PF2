Smoke Haunt - Monsters







Smoke Haunt

The smell of wood smoke bears the taint of burning flesh. A branch in the campfire sputters and hisses. From within the fire's embers a smoldering skull glares out, its eyes wells of cold darkness. Tendrils of smoke dance around and through it like tongues or writhing snakes.

Special Abilities

Flameseer (Su) A smoke haunt can sense any fire of torch size or larger within a half mile. By concentrating, it can peer through such flames as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance.

Flamewalker (Su) Once per day, a smoke haunt can use greater teleport to appear in any fire of Small size or larger. When a smoke haunt teleports into a fire, it can make a Hide check as part of the teleportation to avoid notice from any creatures nearby.

Lifedrinking (Su) A smoke haunt feeds on the heat of the living. A haunt seems to shed soothing warmth, but this is actually the sensation of life being absorbed by the ravenous undead. Any living creature within 20 feet of a smoke haunt must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of negative energy damage. A victim who fails to resist this attack feels warm and complacent, having no idea he has taken any damage unless he makes a DC 15 Wisdom check. If a victim makes this save, he feels strangely weak, but does not necessarily notice the smoke haunt. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Smoke Patterns (Su) A smoke haunt exudes coils of smoke whenever it is surrounded by a fire of Small size or larger. Anyone within 20 feet of a smoke haunt immersed in fire must make a DC 17 Will save or become entranced by the eerie patterns formed amid the rising smoke, taking a -4 penalty on Listen and Spot checks and a -2 penalty on Will saves for as long as the smoke haunt remains in range. This is a mind-affecting pattern. A creature that successfully saves against this ability cannot be affected by the same smoke haunt's smoke patterns for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Said to form from the spirits of lost wanderers slain by exposure and despair, smoke haunts hunger for life, warmth, and a home they're cursed to never find again.
