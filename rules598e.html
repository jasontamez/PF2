Game balance depends on rewarding the treasure values as given on <a href="Rules.aspx?Name=Placing%20Treasure&Category=Building%20an%20Adventure%>Tables 12-4 and 12-5 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</a>. Award too much, and the PCs will unpredictably tear through encounters. Too little, and they'll be unable to keep up. Within the limits of these charts, however, you can dole out treasure in various ways, depending on your group's position on the rewards continuum.

Groups toward the left end of the continuum tend to favor a broader storyline and epic action over a game that casts them in the role of petty coin-counters. In these cases, don't spend a lot of time describing coins, currency transactions, the sale of looted antiquities, or other money issues. Nor should you worry about minor expenses. The <a href="rules558d.html?Name=Cost%20of%20Living&amp;Category=Campaign%20Tips">cost of living guidelines in the Core Rulebook</a> provide an easy way to quantify such expenditures. You can place specific treasures in particular encounters, making sure that the overall amount equals the recommended character wealth by level by the time the characters reach a new level.

In extreme cases for the left side of the continuum, you can handwave treasure altogether. As characters level up, award them the cash they need to bring them in line with Table 12-4. The assumption is that they've picked this up along the way, but in a way that wasn't interesting enough to make a big deal about. Similarly, assume that the characters spend enough to keep themselves in reasonable comfort while in towns and leave it at that.

On the other hand, more reward-focused groups on the right side of the continuum often enjoy tracking treasure. To please them, you can research historical economies and describe each treasure horde in loving detail. For variety, include art objects, gems, and notable or valuable mundane equipment. For example, in the medieval era, items of luxury clothing were among the most highly valued trade goods. A little later, spices became wildly desirable.

Some groups prove particularly cash-obsessed, more interested in leveraging the economic system than killing monsters. If so, assume that they'll go the extra mile to get a higher than usual percentage of the base price, and build that into your game. Peg the ultimate cash values of their treasures to the amount they can get if they coax, haggle, and swindle maximum prices out of their merchant partners. Use this interest to build in plot elements. They might happily spend more time spying on rivals, muscling out competitors, and fending off bandits than they do fighting orcs and demons. Rather than discouraging this behavior, you can go with it, building your treasure values and plot elements around it. The profit motive may not be traditionally heroic, but it does provide an easy source of story hooks. For example: <ul><li>The Skull of the Crimson Khan might fetch little in the farming community surrounding the dungeon, requiring a dangerous overland journey to the Bazaar of the Silver Kingdoms. </li><li>The corpse of a bizarre aberrant creature, if properly preserved and maintained, might fetch a pretty penny from the crazy wizard-sage of the Spiral Tower-if his automaton rivals don't swoop in and steal the coffin first.</li></ul>
