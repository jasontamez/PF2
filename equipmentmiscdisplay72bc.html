Description

Notations on surviving in the wilderness (and accompanying illustrations) fill this manual. If you have no skill ranks in Survival, you can consult this manual as part of attempting a Survival check to perform one of the following tasks: avoid natural hazards, follow tracks, gain a save bonus against severe weather, predict the weather, or provide food and water. Doing so grants you a +4 circumstance bonus on the check, but it takes twice as long to perform the action (for example, providing food and water takes 48 hours instead of 24 hours). If you fail the check, you cannot consult the manual for another check until you move to a new area.
