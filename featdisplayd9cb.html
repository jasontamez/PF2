The fact that you have given up your real name makes you resistant to certain types of magic.

Prerequisites: Risen Guard rank, Risen Guard 10 TPA.

Benefit: Anyone who attempts to use magic in order to learn personal information about you, such as through divination, scrying, or similar magic, must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 plus your level to succeed. You are immune to spells that require the use of your name in order to function (such as trap the soul).

Most members of the Risen Guard with this feat are addressed by their rank.

Special: If you ever choose a real name, you lose all benefits of this feat.
