Your training has tempered your flesh to resist blows as though it were forged iron.

Prerequisites: Str 15; Wis 13; <a href="featdisplayda34.html?ItemName=Perfect%20Style">Perfect Style</a>; <a href="featdisplay1698.html?ItemName=Toughness">Toughness</a>; <a href="featdisplay98bb.html?ItemName=Untwisting%20Iron%20Strength">Untwisting Iron Strength</a>; base attack bonus +13 or monk level 13th.

Benefit: When using Perfect Style, you gain an amount of DR/adamantine equal to 1/3 your character level (maximum 6). Additionally, whenever you break an item with a hardness of 10 or more, you gain DR 1/- for a number of rounds equal to half the item's hit points (maximum 10 rounds); the value of this damage reduction increases by 1 for every 5 points of hardness above 10 the broken item had. You can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to double either of the damage reduction values granted by this feat for 1 round.
