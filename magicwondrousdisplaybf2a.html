Description

This 4-inch-square cloth pocket has no powers unless it is
sewn onto a garment (which takes 1d4 minutes). Once sewn,
it changes its appearance to match the garment. Any magic
item inside it cannot be magically detected, as if protected by
magic aura. Hiding an item in the pocket gives the garment's
wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks
to conceal the item. The pocket can be removed from the
garment with a DC 10 Heal check or an appropriate Craft
check such as Craft (cloth) or Craft (leather); failing this roll by
5 or more gives the pocket the broken condition.
