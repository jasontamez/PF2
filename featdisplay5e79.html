Your sniping is quick enough that you can fire a small volley unnoticed.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay0a50.html?ItemName=Expert%20Sniper">Expert Sniper</a>, <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot</a>, Stealth 6 ranks.

Benefit:  While hiding, you can make two ranged attacks at your highest attack bonus as a full-round action and then immediately use Stealth again. You take the normal penalties on your Stealth check to remain hidden. Effects that modify sniping apply to this full-round action. These attack rolls take a -2 penalty.

Normal:  You can fire only once when sniping.
