Description

When activated, an inertial dampening belt anchors the wearer in place, protecting her against outside forces. This effect gives the wearer a +4 bonus to her combat maneuver defense against bull rush, reposition, and trip attempts, consuming 1 charge per minute. If the wearer falls from a height of greater than 10 feet, the inertial dampening belt automatically activates just prior to impact and reduces the falling damage by half, consuming 1 charge per die of falling damage. If the belt has insufficient charges to reduce the entire amount of damage, the damage is not reduced for the excess dice. Damage from landing on hazardous objects such as spikes is not reduced.
