Special Abilities

Expert Climber (Ex) A morlock can cling to cave walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has hand- and footholds. In effect, a morlock is treated as constantly being under a nonmagical version of the spell spider climb, save that it cannot cling to smooth surfaces. This ability doubles the normal +8 racial bonus to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb speed to a +16 racial bonus.

Leap Attack (Ex) As a standard action, a morlock may make a single attack during a jump. It can make this attack at any point along the course of the leap-the start, the end, or while in mid-air. While jumping, a morlock does not provoke attacks of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.

Swarming (Ex) Morlocks dwell and fight in cramped quarters every day of their lives, and as such are quite adept at swarming foes. Up to two morlocks can share the same square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.

Description

Degenerate humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks have regressed through years of subterranean dwelling into ravenous, barely thinking beasts of the endless night. They no longer remember the civilized lives their ancestors led, although many morlock tribes still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. Ironically, in many cases morlocks worship the statues left behind by these ancestors as their gods. Morlock priests of such ancestor worship have access to the domains of Darkness, Earth, Madness, and Strength. A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.

Morlocks move about on two legs at times, but often drop down to a creepy four-limbed shuffle when speed or stealth is necessary. Their wiry, often emaciated frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions.

Morlocks typically give birth to broods of three to four babies at a time, ravenous creatures born with a full set of teeth and a cannibalistic predisposition. The first few weeks of a brood's life must be carefully mothered to prevent attrition-it usually takes that long for the morlock young to overcome their natural inclination to feed on whatever is closest. Morlocks mature quickly, achieving adulthood after only 5 years of life. A typical morlock can live to a ripe old age of 60-although the majority of their kind die far sooner than that due to violence.

Morlock Religion

Morlocks most often worship their ancient human ancestors, idealized versions of the legendary pure beings their race once resembled. As they don't venerate deities, these morlocks do not have access to cleric domains and most often take levels in oracle and shaman, with witches filling in as arcane servants of their tribes' ancestors in rare cases. Because morlocks have severe racial penalties to Charisma, many of their spiritual leaders are actually ancestor-touched morlocks, possessing a preternatural presence that makes them effective divine spellcasters.

Ancestor-Touched Morlock (CR +0): Occasionally, morlocks are born as conduits for the divine powers they serve. Believing themselves to be mouthpieces for their ancestors, such morlocks are actually the reincarnated souls of the very ancestors they worship. These ancestor-touched morlocks gain a +6 bonus to their Charisma scores and can cast cure light wounds or inflict light wounds (select one) three times per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the morlock's HD). Because of the awe and fear other morlocks have for these divine conduits, they lose their swarming racial ability.
