Description

Each small tin of this specially treated jam contains just enough of the gooey stuff to provide a halfling with a single serving of revitalizing nourishment. While any creature can eat these preserves as a standard action, it only affects halflings in a beneficial way. Halflings who eat the preserves recover from fatigue. Non-halflings who eat alchemical preserves become sickened for 1 round.
