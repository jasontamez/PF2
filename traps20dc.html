Effect A spring-arm spike is similar to a <a href="traps87a8.html?ItemName=Spring%20Snare%20Trap">spring snare trap</a> in that it incorporates a strong sapling bent into a taut arc. When a creature enters a square that contains the spring-arm spike's trigger, the sapling snaps forward, driving a pointed spear into the target. The spring-arm spike makes a melee attack +15 (2d10+4/??3) against the target, which is also knocked prone unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Reflex save.
