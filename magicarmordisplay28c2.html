Description

Carved from a single block of ice
birthed from the breath of the great
white wyrm Sjohvor, the ice-carved
rings of this exquisite suit of +2
chainmail never thaw. If grappled,
the wearer can command the armor
to release an icy blast against the
grappler. The armor then glows with a
pale blue radiance, deals 4d6 points of
cold damage to the target, and causes
the target to be staggered for 1 round.
Once the armor discharges, this ability can't be used until the
armor recharges 1 hour later.

Icelink chainmail is considered light armor and has an arcane
spell failure chance of 20%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4,
and an armor check penalty of -3. The armor weighs half as
much as standard chainmail and floats in water.
