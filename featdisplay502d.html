Your increased martial skill allows you to take advantage of distracted foes to easily impose conditions, and even steal items without being noticed.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplayc280.html?ItemName=Cloak%20and%20Dagger%20Style">Cloak and Dagger Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay9292.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirty%20Trick">Improved Dirty Trick</a>, Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  While you are using Cloak and Dagger Style and wielding your chosen weapon, whenever you make an attack of opportunity against a target, you can attempt a free dirty trick combat maneuver check against the target as a free action as well. Additionally, whenever you successfully perform a dirty trick maneuver against a target, you can immediately attempt a steal combat maneuver check against the target as a free action. If you succeed, the target is unaware you have stolen an item.
