Golem's Conviction

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01zow">Druma, Profit and Prophecy pg. 19</a>
Others whisper that you're little more than a golem obeying orders. They're wrong, but your dedication is clear.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay19f3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Iron%20Will">Improved Iron Will</a>, <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, base attack bonus +8.

Benefit: When you fail a Will save against a mind-affecting effect that would cause you to lose control of your actions (such as <a href="spelldisplay9665.html?ItemName=">dominate person</a> or <a href="spelldisplayb793.html?ItemName=hideous%20laughter">hideous laughter</a>), you can instead opt to follow a rudimentary programming. For a number of rounds equal to half your level (minimum 1) you gain the staggered condition and must either attack a designated target within 60 feet or hold position. If you hold position, you take the total defense action instead of taking whatever action the mind-affecting effect would force you to take. If you choose to attack a target, you must either make a ranged attack, make a melee attack, or move closer to the designated target. If the mind-affecting effect has not been resolved by the time the effects of this feat end, then you are subject to the effect as normal.
