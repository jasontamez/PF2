Even the greatest giants fear your technique.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, dwarf or gnome, defensive training racial trait, <a href="featdisplay2300.html?ItemName=Earth%20Child%20Style">Earth Child Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay6552.html?ItemName=Earth%20Child%20Topple">Earth Child Topple</a>, <a href="featdisplay9381.html?ItemName=Greater%20Trip">Greater Trip</a>, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist</a>, Acrobatics 9 ranks.

Benefit:  You can trip a creature of the giant subtype no matter its size. While you are using Earth Child Style, when a prone creature of the giant subtype stands up and provokes an attack of opportunity from you, if you make an unarmed strike, you can declare you are making a Stunning Fist attempt after the attack hits. You gain a +4 bonus to the DC of any Stunning Fist effect you deliver in this way.

Normal:  You can only trip opponents who are one size category larger than you.

You can spend 5 stamina points to use Stunning Fist without expending a normal use of Stunning Fist when a creature with the giant subtype provokes an attack of opportunity by standing up.
