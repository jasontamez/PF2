Description

This 14-inch rod of simple white oak is sheathed with a 3-inch sleeve of rune-carved steel in the middle. The ends are seared, as if the wood had endured a forest fire. Once per day, the wielder of a rod of Malrion can surround a target with four walls of fire, forming a square around the target. The caster determines whether the walls spring up within 10 or 20 feet of the target and whether the heat affects creatures within or outside the barrier of flames. If the walls are raised within 10 feet of the target with the heat spreading inward, the target takes 8d4 points of fire damage by standing at the centermost space; if they are created within 20 feet, the target takes no damage if he does not move from the centermost space. The size of the target does not affect how far away from a creature the walls appear. Passing through any of the walls deals 2d6+7 points of fire damage (double damage to undead).

The rod creates as many of the four walls of fire as it can, though barriers and cramped quarters might prevent the walls from appearing at their full size. The flames created by the rod last for 1 minute.
