Description

This metal headband grants a +5
insight bonus on Spellcraft checks
made to identify a spell as it is
being cast. Furthermore, once per
day the wearer can attempt to counter a spell by casting the
appropriate spell as an immediate action instead of doing so
with a readied action. The wearer must first identify the spell
being cast before countering a spell with this headband.
