In dim light, you resemble little more than a shadow.

Prerequisites: Wayang.

Benefit:  Whenever you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can move at full speed using Stealth without taking the normal -5 penalty for doing so.

Normal:  When moving at more than half your speed and up to your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty on Stealth checks.
