Servants of gods who hold oaths to be sacrosanct, oathkeepers formally oversee the creation of bargains and personally hunt down those who dare to violate them. Many of these inquisitors previously oversaw religious vows in more formal settings, though more pursue more lucrative contracts. Wronged merchants or cheated customers often seek out oathkeepers to bring justice when local authorities fail.

Alignment: An oathkeeper must be of a lawful alignment, and her alignment must be within one step of her deity's.

This alters the inquisitor's alignment requirements.

Class Skills: An oathkeeper removes Knowledge (nature) from her list of class skills and adds Appraise.

This alters the inquisitor's class skills.

Divine Witness (Su): Every oathkeeper inquisitor develops a unique personal symbol, which she can use to seal an agreement between two or more willing parties. The agreement, whether it's a trade contract, a truce, or a political marriage, must be as detailed as possible and then signed in the oathkeeper's presence by every creature involved. Creatures must sign of their own free will-any magical or physical coercion will cause the contract to crumble into ash when the oathkeeper attempts to place her seal upon it. So long as no mystic or physical force is influencing any participating creature, the oathkeeper can mystically seal the arrangement with her personal symbol, binding all signing parties into upholding their ends of the bargain for the length of time spelled out in the agreement.

Should any oathbound creature break the exact wording of the contract, the agreement is dissolved and the offending creature is cursed, taking a penalty on all d20 rolls equal to the oathkeeper's Wisdom modifier for a number of weeks equal to the oathkeeper's inquisitor level. Furthermore, the inquisitor's symbol appears as a mystic symbol on the offending creature's throat and hands, allowing the oathkeeper to know the creature's location at all times, as per the discern location spell.

If a creature is forced into breaking the agreement by magic or overwhelming physical force (for example, breaking an agreement not to harm via a compulsion spell or by physically hurling an oathbound creature to deal damage to another), then the agreement dissipates harmlessly. The oathkeeper's curse is a curse effect, but it can be removed only with a miracle or wish spell.

This replaces monster lore.

Oathbreaker's Scourge (Su): At 2nd level, if an oathkeeper is given physical evidence of a broken agreement and asked to hunt down the contract's breaker by the offended party, the oathkeeper gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Diplomacy and Survival skill checks to gather information about and track the target. The inquisitor is also treated as being 3 levels higher for the purpose of one judgment she uses against the deal breaker, so long as she keeps possession of the evidence. If the oathkeeper uses oathbreaker's scourge when attacking someone who is actually innocent of fraud-due to forgery, hasty judgments, or other deceptions'she loses access to all of her oathkeeper archetype abilities for 1 month or until she is the target of an atonement spell. This replaces track.
