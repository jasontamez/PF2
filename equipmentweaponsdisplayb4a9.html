Description

This dagger is used in the off hand to block attacks. When you fight defensively or use Combat Expertise while wielding a dueling dagger, your bonus to AC increases by 1. This benefit applies even if you did not attack with the dueling dagger. If you aren't proficient with a dueling dagger, you treat it as a dagger and gain no special benefits. Any effects that apply to daggers apply to dueling daggers.
