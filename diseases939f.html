Anyone who lives with spellscar fever for a week straight without dying becomes immune to the disease and to mana fever, but also becomes a Mana Waste mutant (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Bestiary 28) or a mutant (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5 180), chosen by the GM. A Mana Waste mutant created in such a way can use the following Spellscar Fever Deformities table in place of a deformity from the Inner Sea Bestiary, while a mutant resulting from spellscar fever can take one effect from the same table in place of one deformity and one mutation.
