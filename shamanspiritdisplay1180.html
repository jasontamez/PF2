Stone Spirit

The skin of a shaman who selects the stone spirit takes on a rough, stony appearance. When the shaman calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, tiny gemstones underneath her flesh pulse with a bright glow, like phosphorescent geodes glittering in a dark cave.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Stone spirit can select from the following hexes.

Crystal Sight (Ex): The shaman sees through stone, earth, or sand as easily as if it were transparent crystal. Her gaze can penetrate a number of feet equal to her shaman level (or 1/12th this thickness of metal). The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Lodestone (Su): The shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to become heavy and lethargic. The creature is treated as if it were carrying a medium load (see Table 7-5 of the Core Rulebook). If the creature is already carrying a medium load, it is instead treated as if it were carrying a heavy load. If the creature is carrying a heavy load, its maximum Dexterity bonus to AC is reduced to +0, it takes a -9 armor check penalty, and its movement is reduced to 5 feet. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Metal Curse (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to become slightly magnetic until the end of the shaman's next turn. Whenever the creature is attacked with a melee or ranged weapon constructed primarily of metal, it takes a -2 penalty to AC. At 8th and 16th levels, the penalty increases by -2 and the duration extends by 1 round. Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Stone Stability (Ex): The shaman receives a +4 bonus to her CMD when resisting bull rush or trip attempts as long as she is standing on the ground. At 5th level, the shaman receives Improved Trip as a bonus feat. At 10th level, the shaman receives Greater Trip as a bonus feat. The shaman does not need to meet the prerequisites of these feats.

Ward of Stone (Su): The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a ward of stone. The next time the warded creature is struck with a melee attack, it is treated as if it has DR 5/adamantine. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not already expended. At 8th and 16th levels, the ward lasts for one additional attack. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal looks as though it's made out of earth and stone, with tiny gemstones embedded in its flesh. The animal gains DR 5/adamantine.

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Stone spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Touch of Acid (Su): As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a corrosive weapon.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Stone spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Body of Earth (Su): The shaman gains DR 2/adamantine. This DR increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 8th the shaman possesses. In addition, as a standard action, she can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode from her body in a 10-foot-radius burst. This deals 1d6 points of piercing damage per 2 shaman levels she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between each use.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Stone spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Elemental Form (Su): As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) earth elemental, as elemental body IV with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a being of acid and earth. The shaman gains acid resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any acid or earth spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. She doesn't need to possess these feats to use this ability.
