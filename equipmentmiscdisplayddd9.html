Description

This kit for a wagon provides all the equipment needed to care for up to 10 sick or injured people at a time. It includes two large tents, 10 cots with bedrolls, a sturdy table, a chirurgeon's kit, and five healer's kits. It grants anyone using it a +2 bonus on Heal checks to provide first aid, can be used to treat deadly wounds with a single use of a healer's kit instead of two, and doubles the rate at which patients recover in long-term care.
