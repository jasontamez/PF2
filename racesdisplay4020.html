A grindylow (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 148) looks like a widemouthed goblin from the waist up and a writhing, slimy octopus from the waist down. They have deep-green skin, gray or green tentacles, and mouths full of sharp teeth. Grindylows prefer to attack in packs, making them more dangerous than they appear individually.

Like goblins, grindylows have a tendency to act first and think later, which might result in a grindylow getting lost or separated from its tribe. Although most grindylows simply continue their agenda of trickery and murder when left alone, exceptional grindylows might decide to pursue some greater goal and take up the life of an adventurer.
