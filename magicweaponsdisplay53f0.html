Description

A creature that has taken nonlethal damage from a peaceful weapon becomes shaken for 1 round each time it deals lethal damage to another living creature. The duration stacks with multiple attacks, but this effect can't cause the affected creature to become frightened (even if it is affected by other fear effects). If the affected creature's nonlethal damage is completely healed, this prevents subsequent attacks from extending the duration of the shaken condition, but doesn't end the shaken condition from attacks already made.
