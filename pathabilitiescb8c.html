Mythic Path Abilities










1st-Tier Godling Path Abilities


The three godling sections in this book (pages 6-11) detail what godlings of the various Pathfinder deities might be like, as well as provide a new universal path ability for a godling of each deity. Unless otherwise specified, a mythic character can only select one godling path ability. In addition, each godling section features a sidebar discussing other divine forces that might yield godlings on the Material Plane, such as empyreal lords, demon lords, or powerful lesser gods.

<tr>
<td>Barbs of Ecstasy (Su) [Zon-Kuthon] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 11</a>): Barbs and spikes grow out of you-piercing your flesh, ripping through any armor or clothing, and filling you with exquisite pleasure but your enemies with pain. These spines function as +2 armor spikes. Any creature striking you with a natural weapon or grappling with you takes 1d6+2 points of piercing damage. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to give these spikes the unholy weapon special ability for 1 round per tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Drunken Luck (Su) [Cayden Cailean] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 6</a>): You can expend one use of mythic power to gain an insight bonus equal to double your tier to your AC against a single attack, or on your saving throw against a single effect. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll. After using this ability, you are staggered for 1 round.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fires of Dawn (Su) [Sarenrae] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 7</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to burst into flames. You are protected as though by fire shield (warm shield), except the flames deal a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d8 + double your tier to attackers. A creature wielding a melee weapon with reach is still affected by this damage. These flames last for 1 minute per tier or until you dismiss them as a free action.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gozreh's Grace (Su) [Gozreh] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 9</a>): As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to surround yourself with wind or waves for 1 minute per tier. If you choose wind, swirling winds surround you, guarding you from ranged weapons as though you were protected by wind wall and increasing the effective caster level of any spells you cast that have the air descriptor by 2. If you choose waves, rippling water manifests and swirls around your body, giving melee attacks against you a 20% miss chance, reducing any fire damage taken by 50%, and making it impossible for you to catch on fire.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mantle of the Inheritor (Su) [Iomedae] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 7</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to automatically rid yourself of any one disease, fear, or poison effect affecting you. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to rid an ally within 30 feet of an effect of one of these types.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Prior Claim (Su) [Asmodeus] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 10</a>): As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to delay the effects of a mind-affecting effect for a number of rounds equal to your mythic tier. You can continue to delay the effects each round with further expenditures of mythic power as a free action. Any mind-affecting effect already affecting you or any mind-affecting effect to which you are exposed during this ability's duration does not affect you until the ability's duration has expired.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Roar of Triumph (Su) [Gorum] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 8</a>): As a free action when you kill an enemy or render it unconscious, you can expend one use of mythic power to give voice to a fearsome roar that rattles the very essence of any foes who hear. Nonmythic enemies within 30 feet are deafened and shaken for 1 round per mythic tier you possess (Will halves this duration; DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier). Using this ability on creatures that are already shaken increases the duration; it does not create a stronger fear condition.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Savored Sting (Su) [Calistria] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 8</a>): As a free action after making a successful melee attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to poison the target. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Con modifier) negates the poison. This poison deals 1d3 points of Dexterity damage and 1d3 points of Charisma damage per round for a number of rounds equal to your tier. The duration is halved for poisoned mythic creatures.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Still the Blade (Su) [Shelyn] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 7</a>): As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to prevent a single creature within 30 feet from attacking another creature (Will negates; DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier). The target doesn't lose the action and can take any other action that doesn't directly cause harm to another creature. This effect can affect only creatures with fewer mythic ranks or tiers than yourself.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tempered Steel (Su) [Torag] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 7</a>): As a swift action while wearing armor, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain DR 5/adamantine. Once this effect has prevented a total of 20 points of damage per tier you possess, the protection ends. For example, a mythic character with 3 mythic tiers could prevent a total of 60 points of non-adamantine damage with this effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Wanderer's Touch (Su) [Desna] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 6</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to imbue a weapon in your hand with the throwing and returning weapon special abilities. These weapon special abilities apply only to you, and this effect lasts for 1 minute per tier. By expending one use of mythic power as part of a full attack, you can will the thrown weapon to slice through multiple foes in 1 round, allowing you to make up to your full number of attacks that round against multiple opponents. The weapon strikes the first foe, then bounces to the next, and so on, before returning to you at the beginning of your next turn.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Way of Knowing (Su) [Erastil] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 6</a>): As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and name a creature to determine what direction it lies from you. You must choose a creature you have encountered before and can unambiguously identify. If this creature is on another plane, you instead become aware of this fact, but not which plane. This effect doesn't reveal the distance to the selected creature. This ability can be blocked only by effects that can also block discern location.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>World Breaker (Ex) [Rovagug] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 11</a>): As a free action after you confirm a critical hit with a melee weapon, you can expend one use of mythic power to shatter the ground beneath your foe. This creates difficult terrain in an area centered on your target with a radius equal to 10 feet ?? your tier. You movement is not impeded by the difficult terrain created by this effect. By expending two uses of mythic power when you use this ability, you can create an additional shock wave that extends beneath your target's feet in a cylinder with a depth equal to 5 feet ?? your tier. If this shock wave breaks the surface of the floor (such as if you used this ability on the second floor of a building), the area beneath the target collapses entirely and anyone in the area lands prone on the level below (possibly incurring falling damage in the process).</td>

3rd-Tier Godling Path Abilities


You must be at least 3rd tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Birth Nightmare (Sp) [Lamashtu] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 10</a>): As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power while violently ripping open your belly and revealing the unholy horrors within. You take 3d6 points of damage as a horribly deformed creature of shadow crawls forth. This shadow merges with a creature of your choice within 30 feet, affecting the target as though with a phantasmal killer spell (DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier) with a caster level equal to double your tier. This ability can only affect creatures with fewer mythic ranks or tiers than yourself.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blackfingers' Blessing (Su) [Norgorber] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 10</a>): You can expend one use of mythic power to instantly coat your weapon and your allies' weapons in a poison that you are carrying on your person. This ability only applies poison to the weapons your allies are currently wielding (the weapons they are merely carrying are unaffected), and there is no chance of accidentally poisoning yourself or your allies. You must be carrying a number of doses of poison equal to the number of weapons you wish to apply the poison to, and the doses of poison are consumed in the process of using this ability. Only willing allies can have their weapons affected by this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blade of the Undying (Su) [Urgathoa] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 11</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to transform one of your arms into a scythe of bone, blood, and sinew. This weapon does damage as a +1 scythe of your size, and lasts for 1 round per tier. By expending one additional use of mythic power, your blade gains the wounding ability. Although it only uses one hand, the scythe deals damage as though wielded with two hands. When you activate this ability, whatever you are holding in your hand is melded with your body for the duration of this effect. Any weapon used in your other hand counts as an off-hand attack, regardless of which arm you transform. You can only transform one limb at a time in this fashion.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Claim the Price (Su) [Any Lord of Evil] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 11</a>): Whenever an adjacent enemy confirms a critical hit against you, you can expend two uses of your mythic power to imprint some of your blood on that creature and force it to carry out some action or course of activity, as determined by you. This effect is similar to that of a lesser geas spell, but can affect any creature with fewer Hit Dice than your character level plus your mythic tier. Creatures with mythic ranks or tiers equal to or greater than your mythic tier are unaffected by this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eldritch Insight (Su) [Nethys] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 9</a>): The arcane might of Nethys infuses your every use of magic. The save DCs of any metamagic spells you cast are determined according to the level of the spell slot they occupy after applying the metamagic feat. As a free action while casting a spell prepared with one of more metamagic feats, you can expend one use of mythic power to replace those metamagic feats with any other metamagic feats you know as long as the spell's effective spell level is no higher than it was before.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Final Rest (Su) [Pharasma] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 9</a>): You can always sense the presence of undead creatures as though using detect undead (this ability can be suppressed at will). As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a melee touch attack against an undead creature that deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d10 ?? your tier. Mythic undead and any undead whose Hit Dice are equal to or greater than your character level plus your mythic tier receive a Will save to halve this damage (DC = 10 + your Wis or Cha [whichever is higher] + your tier). Undead whose mythic rank or tier equals or exceeds your own are unaffected by this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shadow of the First Vault (Ex) [Abadar] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 8</a>): Magic items you touch gain a portion of the essence of the perfect representation of that item in Abadar's First Vault. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When activating a spell from a spell completion or spell trigger magic item, you may expend an amount of mythic power as a free action to imbue the spell being cast from that item with one metamagic feat you have access to. The number of uses of mythic power you must expend when doing so is equal to the number of levels by which the chosen metamagic feat increases the spell's level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tip the Balance (Su) [Any Lord of Equilibrium] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 9</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make your weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes count as any alignment needed to overcome a foe's alignment-based damage reduction for 1 minute per tier. During this time, your alignment also counts as the most favorable possible for spells or effects that are based on alignment.</td>

6th-Tier Godling Path Abilities


You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Champion of Weal (Su) [Any Empyreal Lord] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 7</a>): You can show the path of light to those who are tainted by evil. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to attempt to temporarily redeem a non-mythic evil creature within 30 feet. If the target fails its Will save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier), its alignment immediately changes to lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good (your choice) for a number of minutes equal to your tier, and for the duration of this effect the creature pursues a path of righteousness in keeping with its new alignment. Creatures with the evil subtype are immune to this effect. Regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful, a creature can't be affected by this ability more than once in 24 hours.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Transcendent Self (Su) [Irori] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 9</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant yourself a +1 sacred bonus to all ability scores for 1 minute per tier. You can expend two additional uses of mythic power to increase this bonus to +2, or four more to increase this bonus to +3. If you have a ki pool, you can substitute ki for mythic power on a oneto- one basis when activating this ability, as long as you expend at least one use of mythic power.</td>
