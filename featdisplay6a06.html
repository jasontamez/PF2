The tainted plague does not always end in death, but sometimes merely fundamentally alters a person's physical form. You are one such "lucky" individual.

Prerequisites: Con 15, Worldwound affinity.

Benefit: You gain a +1 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and cold, electricity, and fire resistance 2. In addition, thanks to your corrupted and scarred flesh, you gain a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks.

Special: You take a -1 penalty on all other Charisma-based skill checks, Charisma checks, and Fort saves.

You may only gain this feat at 1st level.
