Description

Appearing as a heavy, elaborate neckpiece while worn, a burglar's torc can be removed and disassembled into its component parts in 4 minutes (or in 1 minute if the user is trained in the Disable Device skill). When dismantled, a burglar's torc contains parts that function as a set of mithral masterwork thieves' tools, 10 feet of silk rope, and a mithral grappling hook. Reassembling the torc takes 8 minutes (or 4 minutes if the user is trained in the Disable Device skill). An observer must succeed at a DC 30 Perception check to recognize an assembled burglar's torc for what it is; if the observer handles the torc, the DC for this check decreases to 15.
