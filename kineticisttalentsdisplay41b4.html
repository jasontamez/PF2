Saving Throw Will negates
Your kinetic blast shines brightly, making it harder for your foes to see. If your blast hits a foe (and penetrates SR if applicable), that foe must succeed at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 minute, whether or not it takes damage from the blast. You can reduce the blast's damage by half to increase the DC of this save by 2.
