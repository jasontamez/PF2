Your powerful fists can reduce undead foes to dust.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc91e.html?ItemName=Channel%20Smite">Channel Smite</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +9, channel positive energy 4d6.

Benefit: On a confirmed critical hit using an unarmed strike against an undead creature, you can expend two uses of your channel energy ability as a swift action to destroy that undead creature. The undead creature can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus).
