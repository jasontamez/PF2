Description

The crafter gives her construct crystalline eyes that permit her to use a <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a> or <a href="spelldisplayf650.html?ItemName=scrying,%20greater">greater scrying</a> spell to see from the perspective of her creation. This modification requires the crafter also to prepare a special crystalline orb magically bonded to the eyes, which serves as her focus for the <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a> or <a href="spelldisplayf650.html?ItemName=scrying,%20greater">greater scrying</a> spell. The cost of creating that focus is included in the cost of modifying the construct.

Unlike normal <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a> or <a href="spelldisplayf650.html?ItemName=scrying,%20greater">greater scrying</a>, there is no chance of failure for viewing creatures though the sensor; the creator simply sees what the construct sees for the duration of the spell. Spells cast through the sensor still have the normal chance of operating through the construct's eyes.
