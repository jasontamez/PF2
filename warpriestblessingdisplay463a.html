Deities: Evil deities that offer the Fire blessing or nonevil deities with disasters in their portfolios

Leaping Flames (minor): You touch an ally to bless it with the speed of a wildfire for 1 minute. The ally gains a foot enhancement bonus to its base speed, and the ally gains a  dodge bonus to its AC against attacks of opportunity.

Fiery Wake (major): At 10th level, when you move, you can use a swift action to invoke a blazing blessing on yourself. For the rest of your turn, your movement leaves behind a 10-foot-tall wall of opaque fire in your path. The wall burns for 1 minute. A creature that touches the wall takes 2d6 points of fire damage.
