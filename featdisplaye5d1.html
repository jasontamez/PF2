You are more adept at spending generic focus on focus powers from your chosen school.

Prerequisites: Occultist level 3rd.

Benefit:  Select one of your implement schools. When you spend generic focus to activate focus powers with one of that school's implements, the focus powers cost their listed amount of mental focus.

Normal:  Any focus power activated with generic focus costs twice as much focus to use and maintain.

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must select a different implement school.
