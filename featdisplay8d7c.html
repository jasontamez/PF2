An opponent you have pinned is easy for you to knock out.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay510b.html?ItemName=Greater%20Grapple">Greater Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +9 or monk level 9th.

Benefit:  While you have an opponent pinned, when you succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check to deal an opponent nonlethal damage using an unarmed strike or a light or one-handed weapon, double your damage result. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is immune to the effects of this feat.

When using an unarmed strike or a light or one-handed weapon to deal nonlethal damage to a pinned opponent with this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points to triple the damage instead of doubling it.
