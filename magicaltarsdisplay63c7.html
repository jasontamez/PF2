Description

This altar is a deceptively complex, many-chambered scroll rack or bookshelf capable of securing dozens of documents. Unlike most altars, its magic circle effects are aligned against one or two alignment components (such as only good or both evil and law) appropriate to the interests of the temple. Praying at the altar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks; in addition, the worshiper selects one spell or spell-like ability it can cast and treats its caster level as 1 higher than normal when casting that spell.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, Heighten Spell, guidance, magic circle against chaos/evil/good/law (as appropriate), creator must worship Nethys; Cost 4,000 gp
