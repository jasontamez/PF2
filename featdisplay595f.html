Mocking Dance - Feats







Mocking Dance (Combat, Performance)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 110</a>
You do a little dance that mocks your foe and entertains the crowd.

Prerequisites: Acrobatics 4 ranks or Perform (dance) 4 ranks.

Benefit:  When you spend a swift action to make a performance combat check, before making that check you can either move 5 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity, or you can move your speed and provoke attacks of opportunity. You cannot end this move in a space where you threaten an enemy. If you do move at least 5 feet, you gain a +2 bonus on the performance combat check.
