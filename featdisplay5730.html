You can bring to bear the energies of your entire body in a single point, allowing you to strongly affect your foes with the slightest touch.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Wis 13, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist</a>, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, base attack bonus +8, ki strike class ability.

Benefit: You can make Stunning Fist attacks as melee touch attacks. You may not use Power Attack in combination with this feat. You may choose to expend one use of Stunning Fist when making a bull rush, disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip attempt to provide a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier (if positive) to any attack roll or opposed check required. This bonus applies only to a single attempt and does not apply to subsequent checks (as when continuing a grapple in subsequent rounds). You may use this ability once per round on your turn. You may not use it to defend against combat actions attempted against you.
