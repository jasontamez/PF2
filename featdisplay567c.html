You use Thassilonian magic in a nontraditional way that preserves the ancient traditions while lifting some of its restrictions.

Prerequisites: Thassilonian specialization (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 17).

Benefit: You choose one of your two opposition schools. You also gain Thassilonian as a bonus language. If you already speak Thassilonian, you gain one of the following languages as a bonus language instead: Aklo, Azlanti, Giant, Shoanti, or Varisian.

Normal: A Thassilonian specialist cannot customize his choice for opposition schools.
