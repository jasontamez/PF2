Description

This relatively plain brass ring of mind shielding can read script in any language. The personality within the ring is distrustful of everyone, and it pesters its wearer with increasingly elaborate conspiracy theories. Because of its unrelenting paranoia, the ring provides its wearer with occasional welltimed guidance and can use timely inspiration up to three times per day on the wearer.
