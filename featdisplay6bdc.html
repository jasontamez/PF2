One of this creature's spell-like abilities is particularly potent and powerful.

Prerequisites: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.

Benefit:  Choose one of the creature's spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an empowered spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

When a creature uses an empowered spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by half (+50%). Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected.

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the Quicken Spell-Like Ability.

<table class="inner"><tr><td> Spell Level</td><td> Caster Level to Empower</td><td> Caster Level to Quicken</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>4th</td><td>8th</td></tr> <tr><td>1st</td><td>6th</td><td>10th</td></tr> <tr><td>2nd</td><td>8th</td><td>12th</td></tr> <tr><td>3rd</td><td>10th</td><td>14th</td></tr> <tr><td>4th</td><td>12th</td><td>16th</td></tr> <tr><td>5th</td><td>14th</td><td>18th</td></tr> <tr><td>6th</td><td>16th</td><td>20th</td></tr> <tr><td>7th</td><td>18th</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>8th</td><td>20th</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>9th</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

Special:  This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
