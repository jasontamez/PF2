These paladins often serve as guards, or administer justice for judges and merchants who perform good works for the god of cities. Often, entire units of these paladins are formed to protect holy places in large cities.

Delphos Hesara

Delphos comes from a long line of paladins in service to his home city. Despite his low tolerance for the city's corruption, Delphos would rather frighten, disarm, or subdue foes than kill them. He knows one dead body can create a war between powerful or desperate families, and peace is better served by the judicious use of force. The soldiers under his command either love him or hate him. Delphos tries to be harsh but fair, and believes that strict discipline and an organized system of punishments create better guardians. Such punishments take the form of extra duties or unpleasant posts. All punishments for his guards remain within his order-public shaming leads to disrespect and undermines their authority.

Combat Encounters: While on duty, Delphos typically commands a contingent of his soldiers, but he can sometimes be found alone on the streets of his city. He roams the neighborhoods around the temple of his god, seeking to keep the areas around the holy place safe.

Roleplaying Suggestions: When Delphos encounters strangers, he treats them with care, but also curiosity. He goes out of his way to avoid confrontation, but when that is not possible, he rarely backs down. He might deputize adventurers for special tasks that soldiers can't do in the open, such as tracking down corrupt merchants dealing in contraband.
