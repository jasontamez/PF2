A psychic detective supplements her keen insight with occult skill to unravel mysteries both ordinary and supernatural.

Class Skills:  The psychic detective does not receive Acrobatics, Climb, or Perform as class skills. This alters the investigator's class skills.

Spells:  A psychic detective casts psychic spells drawn from the psychic class spell list (see page 69) and augmented by a select set of additional spells (see Psychic Detective Spells on page 120). Only spells from the psychic class spell list of 6th level or lower and psychic detective spells are considered to be part of the psychic detective's spell list. If a spell appears on both the psychic detective and psychic class spell lists, the psychic detective uses the spell level from the psychic detective spell list. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a psychic detective must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a psychic detective's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the psychic detective's Intelligence modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a psychic detective can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. She knows the same number of spells and receives the same number of spells slots per day as a bard of her investigator level, and knows and uses 0-level knacks as a bard uses cantrips. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score (see Table 1-3 on page 17 of the Core Rulebook).

At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a psychic detective can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, using the same rules as a bard. In effect, the psychic detective loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the psychic detective can cast.

A psychic detective need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any psychic detective spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.

Psychic Detective Spells: A psychic detective has the following spells on her spell list, in addition to psychic spells of 6th level or lower.

1st-Detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, find traps.
3rd-Calm spirit, daylight.
4th-Modify memory.
6th-Banishment, moment of prescience, scrying (greater).

This ability replaces alchemy.

Psychic Meddler (Su):  At 2nd level, a psychic detective receives a +1 bonus on saves against psychic spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 17th level. Starting at 5th level, the psychic investigator adds half this bonus on caster level checks to dispel psychic effects. This ability replaces poison lore, poison resistance, swift alchemy, and poison immunity.

Phrenic Dabbler (Su):  At 3rd level, a psychic detective gains a small pool of phrenic points equal to 1/2 her psychic detective level, as well as one phrenic amplification, as the psychic class feature. This does not allow the psychic detective to qualify for the Extra Amplification feat. This ability replaces the investigator talent gained at 3rd level.

Investigator Talents:  A psychic detective selects investigator talents as normal, except she cannot select the alchemist discovery investigator talent. She can select the Expanded Phrenic Pool feat as a discovery even though she doesn't meet that feat's prerequisites, and she can select an extra phrenic amplification once as a discovery. The following investigator talents, which can be found on pages 32-34 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide, complement the psychic detective archetype: confusing strike, device talent, effortless aid, hidden agendas, inspired intelligence, item lore, and unconventional inspiration. This ability alters investigator talents.
