Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 165</a>
You are skilled at deflecting ranged attacks with your shield.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus.</a>

Benefit:  You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon (not including spell effects, natural attacks, or massive ranged weapons), you may deflect it so that you take no damage, as if you had the Deflect Arrows feat. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, you can use this feat with a buckler. You can spend 5 stamina points to deflect an arrow even while you're flat-footed. You must still be aware of the attack.

Mythic Missile Shield

Your remarkable awareness allows you to deflect multiple ranged attacks and even ray spells.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayacc1.html?ItemName=Missile%20Shield">Missile Shield.</a>

Benefit:  When using Missile Shield, you can deflect an additional number of ranged attacks per round equal to half your tier. You can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to deflect a single ray from a ray spell or effect targeting you.
