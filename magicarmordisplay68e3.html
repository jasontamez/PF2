Description

A suit of armor with this ability becomes poisonous to the touch. The user must slip a vial of 1 dose of the injury or ingested poison to be used into a hidden slot along the armor's inner thigh. Three rounds afterward, the entire suit of armor becomes infused with the poison; any creature that grapples with the wearer (if an injury poison is used) or that successfully hits the wearer with a bite attack (if an ingested poison is used) is immediately exposed to the poison and must save accordingly. Whether or not the victim successfully saves, the poison is discharged from the armor and the wearer must load a new vial into the armor to recharge this ability.
