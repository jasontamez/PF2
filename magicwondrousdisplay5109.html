Description

This small jeweled pendant looks like a tiny dagger set with handsome blue gems, but it is too small to be used as a weapon in combat. While wearing the pendant, the wearer does not provoke attacks of opportunity when delivering a coup de grace. In addition, the pendant grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on Will saves.
