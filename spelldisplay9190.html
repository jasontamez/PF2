Description

You summon an insubstantial lens of force 4 inches in diameter that hovers in front of your face. When you attempt a saving throw against a spell with the figment or pattern descriptor, you can roll twice and take the higher result. You gain a +10 enhancement bonus on Appraise checks to appraise the worth of an item viewed through the lens, and you never judge an item's value wildly inaccurately. If you successfully identify that the item has magical properties, you can immediately attempt a Spellcraft check to determine the item's properties, as if you had cast detect magic on the item and examined it for 3 rounds. This spell cannot determine the properties of artifacts.

The lens cannot be targeted or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, or a rod of cancellation affects it. The lens's AC against touch attacks is equal to 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
