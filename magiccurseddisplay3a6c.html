Description

Deceptively pleasant-looking, a ring of truth bears images of
childlike angels and broadly smiling divine creatures holding
onto links of a heavy chain. The wearer of this cursed ring is
rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or
writing. The wearer may simply omit the truth or choose not
to communicate, but even then must succeed at a DC 20 Will
saving throw to avoid answering a direct question truthfully.
The wearer cannot remove the ring unless the magic of the
curse is negated.
