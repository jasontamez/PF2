Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

A cord of leather attached to this large, hollow animal horn allows it to hang from the neck, wrist, or belt. The bearer can blow the horn as a standard action up to three times per day to create a blast of sound that can be heard at a distance of up to 5 miles.

If the blower is a half-orc, she can encode a message of up to 25 words (usually an order for deployed troops) into the sound and designate any number of allies within range. The designated allies automatically sense the blower's intention and learn the message.
