"Mutant goblin" is an acquired template that can be added to a goblin (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A mutant goblin uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as the base creature + 1.
Armor Class: Natural armor bonus increases by 4.
Mutations: A mutant goblin gains four of the following mutations, determined randomly when it gains the template. For every 5 Hit Dice it has (5, 10, and so on), it gains another random mutation. (Other possible mutations include tusks, a spiked tail, and gills.)

Breath Weapon (Su): The goblin can spew a line of foul acidic blood from its mouth (20-foot line, Reflex DC = 10 + 1/2 Hit Die + its Constitution modifier for half damage, 1d4 points of acid damage per HD, usable every 1d4 rounds). If it has 5 or more HD, the range increases to 30 feet and the damage increases to 1d6 points of acid damage per HD.
Claws (Ex): The goblin's hands become claws. It gains a natural claw attack for each hand that deals damage appropriate to its size, and gains the grab ability with its claws.
Extra Arm (Ex): The goblin gains an extra arm with a functional hand, as the vestigial arm discovery. If it gains this mutation again, it gains another arm.
Fast Healing (Ex): The goblin gains fast healing 1. If it has 5 Hit Dice or more, this increases to fast healing 2. If the creature has 10 HD or more, this increases to fast healing 5.
Venomous Bite (Ex): The mutant goblin grows large fangs, gaining a poisonous bite as a natural attack that deals damage appropriate to its size. The poison functions like wyvern poison, except its DC is 10 + 1/2 HD + its Constitution modifier.
Wings (Ex): The goblin gains dragonfly wings, granting it a fly speed of 30 feet with clumsy maneuverability.

Abilities: Str +4, Int -2.
