You can snatch up an item to use as a weapon in the blink of an eye.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf03d.html?ItemName=Catch%20Off-Guard">Catch Off-Guard</a> or <a href="featdisplay8204.html?ItemName=Throw%20Anything">Throw Anything</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: As a free action, you can pick up an unattended item as part of a movement. Picking up the item does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you have <a href="featdisplay8204.html?ItemName=Throw%20Anything">Throw Anything</a>, you can pick up a number of closely gathered items that could be held in one hand (such as dishes from a stack of plates) equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). You must have a hand free to use this feat.
