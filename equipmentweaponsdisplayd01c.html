Description

This blade is suited for thrusts and parries, making it especially capable of inflicting deep, penetrating wounds. A wielder with Weapon Finesse can apply her Dexterity modifier to attack rolls with an elven thornblade instead of her Strength modifier. An elven thornblade grants no additional benefit when wielded two-handed. In addition, attacks with an elven thornblade gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.
