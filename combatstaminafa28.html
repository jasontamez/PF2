When you threaten a critical hit using this feat, before rolling the confirmation roll, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do and the critical hit is confirmed, the foe is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10 + your base attack bonus, which reduces the effect to the normal sickened condition.
