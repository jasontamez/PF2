By following the path of the stone, students of stone give up much of monks' mobility in favor of sheer resilience. A student of stone has the following class features.

Hard as Stone (Ex):  At 2nd level, whenever an opponent rolls to confirm a critical hit against a student of stone, treat the student of stone's AC as +4 higher than normal. This ability replaces evasion.

Strength of Stone (Ex):  At 3rd level, a student of stone learns to draw strength from the earth. So long as both he and his opponent are touching the ground, the student of stone gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, bull rush and trip combat maneuver rolls, and to his CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt. This ability replaces fast movement.

Bonus Feat:  At 6th level, a student of stone adds Elemental Fist to his list of available bonus feats.

At 10th level, the student of stone adds Shaitan Style to his list of bonus feats, at 14th level, he adds Shaitan Skin , and at 18th level, he adds Shaitan Earthblast.
