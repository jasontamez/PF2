Description

This stylized and labeled map of the First World constantly shifts to reflect the relative locations of dozens of major geographical features, settlements, and other key locations. In addition, a tiny icon of whoever is currently holding the map appears at the user's current location, moving to track the bearer's progress as he travels. The map's scale is very large, covering thousands of square miles of territory, and has little detail outside of the artistic representations of key locations. Once per day, the user can fold the map so that his icon touches the icon of one of the named locations; rubbing them together allows the user to instantly transport himself and up to three other touched creatures to a point just outside that location, as per teleport. Most fey maps acquired by residents of Golarion show only the region of the First World closest to their world on the Material Plane, but reports of those who have traveled beyond this region suggest that some maps are capable of recalibrating to show new locations unknown even to their creators. It's also not unheard of for strange new locations to appear spontaneously in familiar territory as the First World shifts.
