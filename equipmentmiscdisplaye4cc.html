Description

Often extracted from phosphorescent insects, tiny marine plants, or subterranean fungi, glowing ink emits a faint but steady light (typically red or green) that allows you to read it in normal darkness-this includes darkness created by spells like darkness, but not the supernatural darkness created by deeper darkness. If there is glowing ink on an object, you have a +2 bonus on Perception checks to locate it. Mixing glowing ink with marker dye makes the dye glow in the dark until it fades.
