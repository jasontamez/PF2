Prismatic sand perfects and stabilizes the forms of your illusions.

Benefit: When you cast an illusion spell using prismatic sand as an esoteric material component, the DC to disbelieve the illusion increases by 2, as does the spell's AC, if applicable. This benefit lasts for the duration of the spell, but doesn't affect spells with a duration of instantaneous or permanent.

When you gain prismatic sand's greater component effect with an illusion spell, treat your caster level as an additional 2 higher for determining the range. This happens regardless of whether you chose to increase range or area with the greater component effect. This feat does not allow you to further increase the size of an area.
