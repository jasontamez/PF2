Fearsome Spell - Feats







Fearsome Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells inspire great fear in those harmed by them.

Benefit:  When a creature takes damage from a fearsome spell, if that creature failed its save against the spell, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original level. If the spell doesn't allow a save, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the same DC the spell would have if it did allow a save) to negate the shaken effect. If the spell effect already causes creatures to become shaken, on a failed save, add the duration of this metamagic effect to the duration of the shaken condition imposed by the spell. A fearsome spell can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken. A fearsome spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
