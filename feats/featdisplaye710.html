The mere sight of your fiendish banner is enough to send ripples of fear through your enemies.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +8, banner class feature, tiefling.

Benefit:  As long your banner is clearly visible, all enemies within 60 feet take a -2 penalty on saving throws against fear. This penalty does not stack with other effects that provide enemies with penalties on saving throws against fear.
