You are well versed in ancient secrets and forbidden curses, and know how to petition powers with which you are already in contact for additional knowledge.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (history) 4 ranks, hex class feature.

Benefit:  You learn to perform a special occult ritual (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 208) known as Beseeching the Patron, which temporarily grants you a hex you don't already know how to use. You always believe that your ritual is a success, so the GM should roll the required skill checks in secret, revealing the result only when you try to use your newly acquired hex.
