You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When you are the target of a reposition combat maneuver, you can spend a number of stamina points up to your Strength or Dexterity bonus, whichever is greater. Your CMD against that reposition attempt increases by that number.

Furthermore, you can make an attack of opportunity against any creature that attempts to reposition you, unless it also has this feat.
