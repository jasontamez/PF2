You cover yourself in coils of flame drawn from the Plane of Fire.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can shroud yourself in fire. Until the end of your turn, whenever a creature makes a successful melee attack against you, that creature takes a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 plus half your ranks in Knowledge (planes); attacks made using reach weapons ignore this effect. A creature can halve this fire damage with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier).

You can use this feat's benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). If you have at least 9 ranks in Knowledge (planes), activating this ability is a move action. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes), you can activate this ability as a move action or a swift action.
