You squeeze your opponent tightly enough to crush armor or items between you.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaye823.html?ItemName=Kraken%20Style">Kraken Style</a>, base attack bonus +7 or monk level 7th.

Benefit:  The damage you deal with the Kraken Style feat on a successful grapple combat maneuver check increases to an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier + 4. While using this style, you can crush your opponent when you successfully maintain a grapple instead of choking, damaging, moving, pinning, or tying up your opponent. When you do, you deal an amount of damage equal to that of your unarmed strike or one of your natural attacks to your foe's armor or an item held in your foe's hand. This crushing damage bypasses half of the hardness of the armor or item.
