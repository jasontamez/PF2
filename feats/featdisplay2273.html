You've experienced the suffocating grip of demonic possession. The event left you emotionally scarred, but it also tempered your mind against the prying magic of evil enchantments.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay19f3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Iron%20Will">Improved Iron Will</a>, <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will.</a>

Benefit:  If you use your Improved Iron Will feat to reroll a Will save against a compulsion effect and successfully save against the effect, the creature that created the effect (if it originated from a creature) takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
