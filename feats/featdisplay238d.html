You utilize combat as an opportunity to inflict humiliation upon those who provoke your attacks of opportunity.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>; Improved Unarmed Strike or Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +2 or monk level 1st.

Benefit: While using this style, you can make an attack of opportunity with an unarmed strike to deliver a humiliating swat to the target. If you hit the target, you inflict 1 point of nonlethal damage and the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become staggered for 1 round.

Special: A monk of at least 6th level with this feat can select Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
