You quickly turn, forcing devastating blows to be blunted by the thickest part of your armor.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay871d.html?ItemName=Swift%20Iron%20Style">Swift Iron Style</a>, proficiency with medium armor.

Benefit: Once per day when using Swift Iron Style, when you're hit by a weapon, unarmed attack, or natural weapon, you can treat all dice other than the weapon's base damage dice (including extra dice from sneak attack, critical hit, magic special weapon abilities, and Vital Strike) as having rolled 1s. You can use this ability a second time per day when your base attack bonus reaches +8, and a third time at +16.
