Planar Traveler - Feats







Planar Traveler (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Quests-Campaigns">Quests and Campaigns pg. 12</a>
The confines of the Material Plane cannot sate your
wanderlust, and you walk between alternate spheres of
reality unhindered.

Prerequisites: You must be related to an outsider or have
been born on a plane other than the Material Plane.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks when
outside your home plane. You can identify portals and
other planar connections as well as where they lead by
sight or touch with a successful DC 20 Perception check.

Goal: Spend at least 24 consecutive hours on three
different planes of existence other than your home plane
or more than a month on a single plane other than your
home plane. Demiplanes do not count for the purposes of
fulfilling this goal.

Completion Benefit: Whenever you cast a spell or
use a magic item to travel to another plane, you always
arrive exactly where you had intended. In addition, when
identifying portals with the first benefit of this feat, you
gain a glimpse of what you would see, hear, and smell
upon arriving on the other end of the portal.


Suggested Traits: Fey Protection, Scholar of the Great Beyond, Wanderlust.


Possible Planar Traveler Quests


<table class="inner"><tr><td>d8</td><td>Quest</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Your morbid curiosity urges you to journey through
the Worldwound, either to contact or combat what
impossible fiendish entities no doubt lurk beyond
(page 198).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Several weak points exist between the forested realms
of the River Kingdoms and the plane known as the First
World. You seek to learn the mysteries of that realm's
strange fey inhabitants (page 239).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Ancient relics imply connections between the fallen
Empire of Thassilon and the nightmare realm of Leng
(pages 211, 245).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The wealth of mortal cities pales in comparison to
that of the fabled City of Brass on the Plane of Fire.
You intend to seize at least a part of the metropolis's
incredible wealth for yourself (page 241).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>You have always been fascinated by death. Now, you
wish to travel to its kingdom, the Boneyard, in life,
either to rescue another soul from an uncertain fate or
to learn of your own destiny (page 243).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>You have resolved to reach Hell's vast fortress-capital
Dis, where the magical treasures of Hell are available for
a price (page 244).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>In Axis, the city of perfect order, you hope to scale the
crystal spires where the laws of reality are carved so
that you might understand or, perhaps, change them
(page 243).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>The Immortal Ambulatory drifts among countless planes,
allowing those who can reach the demiplane to visit
many other realities. Perhaps by going there you can
resolve long-unanswered questions regarding dragons
and the nature of the multiverse (page 245).</td></tr></table>
