You look for every edge when flanking an enemy.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +4.

Benefit:  Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same creature, your flanking bonus on attack rolls increases to +4. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit against the flanked creature, it provokes an attack of opportunity from your ally.

When you threaten but fail to confirm a critical hit against a creature you are flanking, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, that creature provokes an attack of opportunity from each ally with this feat who is flanking the creature, even though you didn't confirm the critical hit. You still can't use this ability against targets immune to critical hits.
