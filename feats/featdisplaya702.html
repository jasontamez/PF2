Ectoplasmic Spell - Feats







Ectoplasmic Spell (Metamagic)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 158</a>
Your spells breach the gulf between dimensions, sending ghostly emanations into the ether.

Benefit:  An ectoplasmic spell has full effect against incorporeal or ethereal creatures. An ectoplasmic spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
