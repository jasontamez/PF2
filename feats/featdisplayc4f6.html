attack bonus +12 or 10th-level monk.

Benefit:  As an immediate action, whenever an
opponent up to one size category larger than you misses
you with its bite attack, you can attempt a grapple with
a -5 penalty on the check. If you succeed, you have
grappled your opponent and are holding its mouth shut,
preventing it from using its bite attack, breath weapon,
or spells with a verbal component until it escapes your
grapple. You may make this grapple attempt even if the
target is out of your reach.
