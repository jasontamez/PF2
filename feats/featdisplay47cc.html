You have glimpsed the madness at the edges of reality.


Prerequisites: You must have faced an undead, evil outsider, or aberration with a CR greater than your level +4, or have
the Raised Among the Dead or The Dead One background.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge
(dungeoneering) checks to identify the vulnerabilities
and powers of aberrations, Knowledge (planes) checks
to identify the vulnerabilities and powers of evil
outsiders, and Knowledge (religion) checks to identify the
vulnerabilities and powers of undead, and you can make
such checks untrained. If you have 10 or more ranks in
any of these Knowledge skills, the bonus increases to +4
for the appropriate skill. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus
on saves against fear effects.


Goal:  Be killed or driven insane (as determined by the
GM) by an aberration, evil outsider, or undead. This leaves
your mind permanently marked.


Completion Benefit:  Any sane creature that attempts to
read your thoughts takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage
(Will DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modified
negates). In addition, the effect of any ability damage,
ability drain, or penalty to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or
Charisma is halved (minimum 1). You take a -2 penalty
on Will saving throws. Whenever you roll a save against a
mind-affecting effect, roll twice and keep the better result.
