You might have been struck by lightning or fallen off a horse, but either way your death came as the result of pure bad luck, a happenstance accident no one could have predicted.

Prerequisites: Duskwalker.

Benefit: Once per day, if you would die as a result of an attack or failing a saving throw, as an immediate action you can reroll the attack or saving throw. You must use the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. At 11th level, you can use this feat a second time per day.
