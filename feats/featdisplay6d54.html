Things would be better if everyone just did as you wished.

Prerequisites: 10 Hit Dice, neutral evil alignment.

Benefit: You can store a number of <a href="rules6336.html?Name=Shifts%20and%20Affirmations&amp;Category=Alignment%20(Unchained)">affirmations</a> up to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to use at any time, not just within the next 24 hours. You can use an affirmation and touch a creature as a standard action to bestow a single condition or harmful effect from the list of antipaladin cruelties (using your Hit Dice as your antipaladin level to determine which cruelties you can use and their effects). Lastly, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against good creatures. This is an alignment-based effect.

Residual: If you have this feat but you are no longer neutral evil, you continue to gain the +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against good creatures.
