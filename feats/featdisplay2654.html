You can ready yourself to spring an attack against your enemies at a moment's notice.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes.</a>

Benefit: You can ready an action to charge when an enemy enters a specific space you designate. You must be able to charge the square both when you ready the charge and when the readied action triggers, or you cannot attempt the readied action. When you make a readied charge, you can move only up to your speed.

Normal: You can't ready an action to charge. Charging allows you to move up to twice your speed.
