You can convert any spell into an attack.

Prerequisites: Arcane spellcaster, caster level 10th.

Benefit:  As a standard action, you can sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a ray, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This attack deals 2d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every level of the spell or spell slot you sacrificed. 0-level spells may not be sacrificed in this manner.

Mythic Arcane Blast

You can manipulate raw eldritch energies to do more than just deal damage.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay28ce.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Blast">Arcane Blast.</a>

Benefit:  When you use Arcane Blast, you may halve the damage dice to also perform your choice of either a trip or bull rush combat maneuver against the target of the blast. You can't move with an opponent you bull rush with this feat. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check for this attempt equal to half the spell level of the spell you sacrificed when using Arcane Blast, and you can substitute your Intelligence or Charisma modifier in place of your Strength modifier when determining your combat maneuver bonus.

In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power to change the damage dice of your Arcane Blast to d8s instead of d6s.
