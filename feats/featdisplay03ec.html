Your attacks are calculated to draw the most blood possible. With every swing, you open persistent, vicious wounds that drain the life from your enemies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a> with slashing weapon.

Benefit: When you deal damage with a melee attack with a slashing weapon to an opponent you have already damaged this round, you can also deal 1 point of bleed damage that lasts for 2 rounds. This bleed damage stacks with itself, but only if dealt in the same round.
