You must beat down the masses to have true order.

Prerequisites: 10 Hit Dice, lawful evil alignment.

Benefit: You can store a number of <a href="rules6336.html?Name=Shifts%20and%20Affirmations&amp;Category=Alignment%20(Unchained)">affirmations</a> up to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to use at any time, not just within the next 24 hours. You can use an affirmation to cast <a href="spelldisplay9304.html?ItemName=hold%20person">hold person</a> as a spell-like ability as a standard action, with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice. You gain a +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against chaotic and good creatures (or +4 if the creature is both chaotic and good). This is an alignment-based effect.

Residual: If you have this feat but you are no longer lawful evil, you continue to gain the +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against chaotic and good creatures (or a +4 bonus if the creature is both chaotic and good).
