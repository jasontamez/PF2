Benefit: When you cast a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, you can choose to summon a single creature that exudes a putrid odor or befouls the water surrounding it, granting it the stench universal monster ability. The duration of the sickened condition created by this stench is a number of rounds equal to the spell'slevel.
