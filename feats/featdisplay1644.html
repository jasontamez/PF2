Unlike others of your kind, you are able to pull your prey toward yourself.

Prerequisites: Str 17, sticky tongue.

Benefit:  Your tongue attack gains the pull special ability. At the start of your turn, if your tongue is attached to a target of your size or smaller and you succeed at a combat maneuver check, you can pull the target 5 feet closer to you as free action.
