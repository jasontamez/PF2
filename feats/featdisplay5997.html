Filled with the might of nature, you need no weapons of steel or wood. Your fists and feet are as potent as any creation of the forge.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay29b3.html?ItemName=Wilding">Wilding.</a>

Benefit: The damage die of your unarmed strikes increases to 1d6 (or 1d4 if you are Small). This does not stack with any other effects that increase the damage die of your unarmed strikes, including levels in classes such as monk. Increases to your actual size category (such as enlarge person) still increase your damage die as normal.
