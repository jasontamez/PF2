Your powers wax with the deaths of mortals.

Prerequisites: One or more racial spell-like abilities, outsider with the evil subtype.

Benefit: Whenever you perform a coup de grace that kills a creature, choose a racial spell-like ability you have that is usable a limited number of times per day (but not more limited, such as once per week or once per month). The spell-like ability's spell level must be equal to or less than half the victim's Hit Dice. You regain a use of that spell-like ability. This has no effect if you haven't expended any uses of that spell-like ability.

In addition, you can gain this benefit when an ally within 30 feet performs a coup de grace that kills its victim. The ally must openly proclaim that the killing is done in your name. This otherwise acts as if you had performed the coup de grace yourself.

You can gain this feat's benefit only once every 24 hours.
