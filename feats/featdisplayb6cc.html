You work with your allies to create a defensive guard to facilitate spellcasting.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +3 or ability to cast 2nd-level spells.

Benefit: When an adjacent ally with this feat attempts a concentration check to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability defensively, you can attempt a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to guard that ally. Your ally can use either the result of her own concentration check or the result of your combat maneuver check to determine whether she succeeds at casting the spell or using the spell-like ability.
