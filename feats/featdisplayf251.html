Benefit:  When making a reposition combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322), you can move an enemy into a trap or other hazardous area, such as a pit, wall scythe, or blade barrier. When you do so, the moved enemy is treated as though it had activated the trap or triggered the hazard, and it takes a -2 penalty to AC and on saving throws to mitigate the trap or hazard's effects.

Normal:  You cannot reposition a foe into an intrinsically dangerous space such as a pit or blade barrier.
