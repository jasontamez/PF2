A little diversion is all you need to slip through your foe's defenses.

Prerequisites: Bluff 1 rank.

Benefit:  Whenever an ally who also has this feat successfully feints an opponent, that opponent also loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against the next attack you make against him before the end of the feinting ally's next turn.

When feinting an opponent, you can spend 5 stamina points to have that opponent lose its Dexterity bonus to AC against the next attack made by any of your allies. If the next ally to attack that opponent also has this feat, that ally's attacks do not count as the next attack for the purpose of this combat trick, allowing another ally to gain this benefit.
