Your claw attacks do greater harm to your enemy.

Prerequisites: Str 13, two claw natural weapon attacks, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  If you hit a creature with two claw attacks in the same turn, the second claw attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. You can use this feat once per round.

When you make two claw attacks but hit with only one, you can spend 5 stamina points to deal the precision damage granted by this feat anyway.
