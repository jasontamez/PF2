Improved Back to Back (Teamwork)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 105</a>
After much practice, you and an ally have become adept at fighting in close proximity to one another.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay0944.html?ItemName=Back%20to%20Back">Back to Back</a>, Perception 5 ranks.

Benefit:  While you are adjacent to an ally who is flanked and also has this feat, you can spend a swift action to gain a +2 bonus to AC against all flankers until the start of your next turn.
