You can heal more than just injuries of the flesh.

Prerequisites: Heal 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks, base Fortitude saving throw bonus +3.

Benefit: You can cause an item that has a conjuration (healing) spell of 2nd level or higher listed in its construction requirements to cast lesser restoration. If you have 9 ranks in both Heal and Use Magic Device, you can instead cause an item that has a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or higher listed in its construction requirements to cast either remove blindness/deafness or remove paralysis. You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day when your base Fortitude save bonus reaches +9 and +12.
