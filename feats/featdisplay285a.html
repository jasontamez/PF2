You can dispel magic with abjuration magic items.

Prerequisites: Use Magic Device 3 ranks, base Fortitude save bonus +6.

Benefit:  You can cause an item that has an abjuration spell of 2nd level or higher in its construction requirements to cast dispel magic, but only to perform a targeted dispel. You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day at base Fortitude save bonus +9 and +12.
