Your vines produce fruit with helpful properties.

Prerequisites: Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, gathlain, racial fly speed.

Benefit: Your vines produce fruit with helpful properties. Once per day as a full-round action, you can withdraw a small fruit from your symbiotic vines. Roll d% to determine a Common Potion or Oil on Table 7-17: 1st-Level Potions and Oils on page 371 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment; the fruit functions as the result of that roll. After 24 hours, the fruit loses its magic.
