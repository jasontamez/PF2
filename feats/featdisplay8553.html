Ricochet Toss (Weapon Mastery)

You are able to angle your thrown weapon attacks in such a way that the weapon ricochets and immediately returns to you.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>, base attack bonus +6, weapon training class feature with a ranged weapon.

Benefit:  When you make a ranged attack with an appropriate thrown weapon, the weapon returns to your hand immediately after the attack is resolved. This ability does not allow bullets, thrown ammunition such as darts or shuriken, or thrown splash weapons to return to you. Improvised thrown weapons don't return to you unless you have the Throw Anything feat.
