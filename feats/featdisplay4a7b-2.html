You are able to sprout more quickly than most, though your body is underdeveloped.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, seed racial trait, ghoran.

Benefit:  Whenever you use your seed ability to grow a new body, you can choose to sprout in half the normal amount of time (1d6 days instead of 2d6 days). If you do, your new body is Small instead of Medium, your natural armor bonus from racial traits (if any) is reduced by half, and you take a -2 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution. These modifications last 1d3 weeks, after which your body matures to its proper size and loses all penalties associated with sprouting early.
