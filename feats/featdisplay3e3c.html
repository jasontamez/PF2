Your scrying spells last longer.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast a spell of the scrying subschool.

Benefit: Any scrying spell you cast lasts twice as long as normal, as if it were cast as an extended spell with the Extend Spell metamagic feat. Additionally, when you cast a scrying spell with a casting time of 10 minutes or longer, that casting time is halved.
