While you're grappled, you become even more dangerous.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit:  You have learned to leverage a grappling creature's weight against it. While you're grappled, attacks you make against the grappler using armor spikes, a light or one-handed weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike deal damage as if the strike or weapon were one size category larger than it actually is.
