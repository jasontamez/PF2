Rough mountain roads are as smooth as cobblestone to you. Enemies challenge you in your home territory at their peril.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, base attack bonus +6, cragkin half-orc.

Benefit: When you and the target of your attack are both in difficult terrain, treat the target as if he were flat-footed. In addition, if you attack a flat-footed enemy from a higher elevation (including while falling), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on your attack roll.
