Your blows knock swimming opponents off balance.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, merfolk.

Benefit:  When you make a successful melee attack against a swimming target, as a free action you can attempt to knock the target off balance. Treat this as a trip combat maneuver. If you succeed, the target is considered off balance until it recovers its balance, usually by making a Swim check on its turn. This feat has no effect on creatures with a swim speed, those using magic such as freedom of movement, and creatures that can't be tripped.

When you successfully knock a target off balance while using this feat, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to apply a penalty on the target's Swim checks to recover its balance from the effect equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
