When you use a weapon with which you have Weapon Focus to damage a creature that has damage reduction, you can spend 5 stamina points to allow all your allies within 30 feet to ignore 10 points of that creature's damage reduction for 1 round. This amount is reduced to 5 points for damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/-). This effect does not stack with Greater Penetrating Strike's normal effect, but it does allow you to apply the effect to all your other weapons for the duration.
