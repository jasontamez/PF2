Music plays a key role in goblin culture-at the very least, goblins are fond of cacophonous chants describing the last enemy they slew or what they're roasting for dinner. You have gathered, however, that non-goblins don't appreciate your songs very much.

Prerequisites: <a href="racesdisplay7cda.html?ItemName=Goblin">Goblin</a>.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can sing a song so terrible and ear-splitting that each enemy within 15 feet of you that hears it must succeed at a Will save or be dazed for 1 round. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier. Whether or not the initial save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.
