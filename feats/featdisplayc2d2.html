You and your allies can cast spells through each other's familiars as if they were your own.

Prerequisites: Familiar with the share spells ability.

Benefit: You and any of your allies with this feat can cast spells with a target of "you" on each other's familiars as touch spells. Both the target familiar and that familiar's master must be willing for the spell to take effect. You can cast spells on each other's familiars even if the spells would not normally affect creatures of the targeted familiar's type.
