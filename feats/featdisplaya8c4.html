Using a portion of your innate magic, you cloak your body in darkness to evade attacks.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, darkness racial spell-like ability.

Benefit:  As an immediate action, you can create a shifting haze of darkness around yourself, granting you concealment against one attack. The haze dissipates after the attack is resolved. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day when your caster level for your racial darkness spell-like ability reaches 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th.
