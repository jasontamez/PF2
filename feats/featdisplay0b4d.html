You can jump off willing allies and unwilling opponents to attack creatures from above.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, Wis 15, <a href="featdisplay646e.html?ItemName=Dragonfly%20Style">Dragonfly Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, Acrobatics 5 ranks, Climb 5 ranks.

Benefit: While using <a href="featdisplay646e.html?ItemName=Dragonfly%20Style">Dragonfly Style</a>, the bonus on your melee attacks increases to +2 and applies to opponents up to two size categories larger than you. In addition, you can substitute a creature your size or larger in place of a vertical surface. You can freely use a willing creature in such a manner, but using a hostile creature requires a successful Acrobatics check with a DC equal to the creature's CMD. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you provoke an attack of opportunity from the hostile creature.
