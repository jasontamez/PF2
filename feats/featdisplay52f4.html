You must prove yourself through single combat.

Prerequisites: You must have defeated a single challenging
foe without any aid from another, or have the Champion
of a God, Champion of the People, Competition Champion, or Gladiator background.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can declare a single
combat challenge to one foe within 50 feet and in line of
sight. Upon doing so, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls
and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against that foe as long as
no one else threatens that opponent or until the single
combat challenge ends. If another combatant attacks you
or your foe, the challenge ends and you take a -2 penalty
on attack rolls and to AC for 1 round. Though you can
declare a single combat challenge at will, once you declare
it on a foe you can't declare it on the same foe for another
24 hours.


Goal: Defeat an appropriate number of challenging foes
in single combat. These combats must not be interrupted
by other creatures, and the foes must not have already
been substantially injured or impaired prior to combat
with you.


Completion Benefit: Your bonuses for single combat
increase to +2. In addition, any confirmed critical hits
you make against such a foe deal an additional 1d6 points
of damage.
