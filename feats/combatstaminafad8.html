When you hit with a Jawbreaker attack, you can spend 5 stamina points to increase the bleed damage to 1d6 points, increase the DC of the Heal check to end the bleed to 20, and require the user of a spell or ability that cures hit point damage to succeed at a DC 15 caster level check to end the bleed effect.
