Deadly Stroke - Feats







Deadly Stroke (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 121</a>
With a well-placed strike, you can bring a swift and painful end to most foes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a>, <a href="featdisplay6770.html?ItemName=Greater%20Weapon%20Focus">Greater Weapon Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplaybc83.html?ItemName=Shatter%20Defenses">Shatter Defenses</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a>, proficiency with the selected weapon, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit: As a standard action, make a single attack with the weapon for which you have Greater Weapon Focus against a stunned or flat-footed opponent. If you hit, you deal double the normal damage and the target takes 1 point of Constitution bleed (see Conditions). The additional damage and bleed is not multiplied on a critical hit.

You can spend 5 stamina points to make a Deadly Stroke attack against a dazed opponent, or 10 stamina points to make a Deadly Stroke against an opponent you are flanking.

Mythic Deadly Stroke

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 62</a>
You can kill with a single stroke.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc67d.html?ItemName=Deadly%20Stroke">Deadly Stroke.</a>

Benefit:  When making a Deadly Stroke attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to instantly kill a nonmythic living creature. A Fortitude save (DC 10 + your base attack bonus + your tier) negates this effect, though the attack still deals double damage and Con bleed as Deadly Stroke. Constructs, oozes, and creatures immune to critical hits or precision-based damage can't be killed with this feat.
