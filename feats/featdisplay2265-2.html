You can modify your spells' apparent components and characteristics at a moment's notice.

Prerequisites: Bluff 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.

Benefit: When you cast a spell, you can apply any number of the stylized magic modifications; however, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 5 + twice the spell's level + 5 per modification) or the magic is too badly warped to function and the spell is wasted with no effect
