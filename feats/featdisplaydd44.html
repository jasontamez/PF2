Your crafting skill and the secret knowledge of your people allows you to create new wyrwoods.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2071.html?ItemName=Craft%20Construct">Craft Construct</a>, <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a>, <a href="racesdisplay6f1b.html?ItemName=Wyrwood">wyrwood</a>.

Benefit: By completing a unique ritual, you can create a <a href="racesdisplay6f1b.html?ItemName=Wyrwood">wyrwood</a>. While you can use any Small wooden construct to create the base of a wyrwood, infusing it with life and consciousness requires a specific process. The process requires a flawless <a href="magicwondrous8768.html?FinalSlot=Ioun">ioun stone</a> worth at least 10,000 gp. For the ritual to succeed, you must spend 1 month in complete isolation with the construct that will become a wyrwood. Each week, you must succeed at a DC 30 Craft (carpentry) or Craft (sculpture) check. Failure requires you to start again, although the materials can be reused. Over this time, the construct reshapes itself around the ioun stone until it finds the form it will take permanently- thus even non-humanoid constructs become humanoid as they become wyrwoods. While wyrwoods are born as fully formed adults, they lack any skill or training, so they have only 1 level in the <a href="classdisplay8640.html?ItemName=Commoner">commoner</a> class.
