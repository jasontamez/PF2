Searing Distraction - Feats







Searing Distraction (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjq">Heroes of the Darklands pg. 5</a>
You harry your foes with the light and heat of your weapon.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf03d.html?ItemName=Catch%20Off-Guard">Catch Off-Guard.</a>

Benefit: When you make an attack using a light source such as a sunrod or torch as an improvised weapon, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round. On a critical hit, the target is instead blinded for 1 round. The DC of the effect is 10 + half your character level + your Dexterity modifier. Blind targets are immune to this effect.
