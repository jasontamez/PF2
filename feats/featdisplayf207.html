You produce enough venom to cast a web of poison over your hapless victims.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya9c9.html?ItemName=Spit%20Venom">Spit Venom</a>, <a href="featdisplay1120.html?ItemName=Viscous%20Venom">Viscous Venom</a>, nagaji.

Benefit: When you spit poison using the ability granted by the Spit Venom feat, you can envenom a 5-foot-radius area within 30 feet for 1 round. Any creature that enters or begins its turn in this area is both exposed to the poison granted by Spit Venom and entangled as if you had targeted that creature with the ability granted by the Viscous Venom feat. In addition, you gain one additional use per day of the ability to spit poison granted by the Spit Venom feat.
