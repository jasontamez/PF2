You have graduated from one of the many colleges, universities, and specialty schools of higher learning scattered throughout Katheer.

Prerequisites: Int 15, Qadira affinity.

Benefit: Whenever you succeed on a Knowledge check to identify a kind of creature you face, you can spend a standard action to provide detailed information to your allies. Doing so grants every ally who can hear you within 30 feet a +1 circumstance bonus on weapon damage rolls made against the identified kind of creature for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence bonus. You may only use this ability once per encounter. Creatures immune to critical hits and sneak attacks are not immune to the extra damage from this ability.
