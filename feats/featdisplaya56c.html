Your recklessness often puts you in harm's way, and you are terrifying to behold when covered in your own blood.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Intimidate).</a>

Benefit: Whenever you take an amount of piercing, slashing, or bleed damage equal to or greater than double your character level, you can attempt an Intimidate check as an immediate action to demoralize the creature that dealt the damage as long as it is within 30 feet of you. If the damage resulted from a critical hit, you can cause the target creature to be sickened instead of shaken if you successfully demoralize it. You can use this feat only once per round to attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent.
