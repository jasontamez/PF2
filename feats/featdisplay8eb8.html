What some would call dabbling you call a wide range of interests. Your breadth of knowledge offers unexpected insights in many situations.

Prerequisites: 2 ranks each in 5 different Knowledge skills.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge checks if you have 1-5 ranks in that skill. This bonus does not stack with Skill Focus. You can make untrained Knowledge checks with DCs up to 15.
