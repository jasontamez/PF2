Your heritage is strange or difficult to trace, and people fear your otherworldly powers.

Prerequisites: Dhampir.

Benefit:  Your undead progenitor left you with more than a hint of vampiric nature. You gain a natural bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. Once per day upon making a successful bite attack, you can choose to deal an additional 1d4 points of bleed damage to the creature struck.

Special:  You can only select this feat at 1st level.
