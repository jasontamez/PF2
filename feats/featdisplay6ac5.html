You carry in body and mind the spirits of the river that flow and sustain.

Prerequisites: Aquatic subtype, Knowledge (nature) 1 rank.

Benefit: You gain the ability to breathe air or water interchangeably. You become fatigued if you remain out of the water for a number of days equal to your Constitution bonus plus your character level. This fatigue only goes away once you immerse yourself in water for 8 hours. Mundane or magical effects that remove fatigue have no effect on this condition.

In addition, choose one of these skills: Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), or Knowledge (nature). That skill is always a class skill for you.
