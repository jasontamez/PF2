You can use small but deadly weapons to restrain a foe, forcing it to choose between pain and capitulation.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>, Intimidate 7 ranks.

Benefit: You can draw a light or one-handed piercing weapon and stab your opponent with it when you initiate a grapple. You take a -2 penalty on your combat maneuver check to initiate the grapple, but since you pull the weapon out as part of the grapple, you don't take the usual -4 penalty. If you succeed, you grapple your opponent as normal, and the weapon doesn't count as being in your hand either for the purposes of the -4 penalty or for dealing damage while maintaining a grapple. If your opponent successfully breaks the grapple, it takes an amount of damage equal to the base weapon damage of the weapon you used to initiate the grapple plus an additional 1d4 points of bleed damage. A successful DC 15 Heal check or any magical healing ends the bleed effect. If you choose to end the grapple, you can opt to not deal the bleed damage, but either way, your opponent still takes the base weapon damage. While maintaining this grapple, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on all Intimidate checks made against your opponent.
