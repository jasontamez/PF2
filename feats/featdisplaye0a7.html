You are a master of criminal commerce.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (local) 5 ranks.

Benefit:  Attempting a Diplomacy check to access a black market requires only 5d4 minutes of effort. You can apply the Crime modifier of a black market you have accessed to Bluff, Diplomacy, Profession, and Sleight of Hand checks to make money within the market itself.

This bonus applies to skill checks to covertly perform downtime activities (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 84) and to checks to earn capital in black markets. You treat the capital spending limits of black markets as 5 higher than their listed value.
