When your ally fails to disarm an opponent within your reach, you can try to disarm that same foe.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  When an ally with this feat fails a disarm combat maneuver check made on his turn against an opponent within your melee reach, as an immediate action you can attempt a disarm combat maneuver check against that foe.
