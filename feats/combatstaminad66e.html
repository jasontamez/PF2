When you attack a creature subject to the blink spell, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, your Greater Blind-Fight feat works against that creature until the beginning of your next turn, either treating the blink miss chance as 20% and allowing a reroll or ignoring the blink miss chance if you have a way to see or strike ethereal creatures.
