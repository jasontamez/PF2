Skaveling Companion

You are bonded with a terrifying undead mount created through foul daemonic rites.

Prerequisites: 7th level in a class that grants an animal companion or mount, urdefhan.

Benefit:  In place of the animal companion or mount granted by your class feature, you are bonded with a skaveling (Bestiary 2 42). Though less intelligent than others of its kind and lacking the ability to paralyze and infect victims with its bite, the beast serves you unerringly.

Bat, Skaveling

Size Large; Speed 20 ft., fly 40 ft. (good); AC +6 natural armor; Attack bite +10 (2d8+6); Ability Scores Str 23, Dex 19, Con -, Int 2, Wis 15, Cha 14; Special Attacks screech (DC 15); Languages none; Special Abilities Screech (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a skaveling can utter an ear-splitting screech that stuns non-skavelings in a 20-foot burst. All creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d3 rounds. Other skavelings, mobats, and urdefhans are immune to this effect. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
