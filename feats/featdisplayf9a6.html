Your unique understanding of improvised tools enables you to turn the intrinsic form of all manner of objects to your advantage in combat.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay38c1.html?ItemName=Catch%20Off-%20Guard">Catch Off- Guard</a> or <a href="featdisplay8204.html?ItemName=Throw%20Anything">Throw Anything</a>, <a href="featdisplay9508.html?ItemName=Shikigami%20Style">Shikigami Style</a>.

Benefit: While in <a href="featdisplay9508.html?ItemName=Shikigami%20Style">Shikigami Style</a>, you can take a -2 penalty on attack rolls to treat an improvised weapon as if it had one of the following weapon special qualities until the start of your next turn: blocking, brace, disarm, distracting, nonlethal, performance, or trip. If the weapon has the fragile special quality or broken condition, you can treat it as if it had the jagged special quality (Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory 2 22).
