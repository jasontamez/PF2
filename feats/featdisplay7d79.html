You are ever the opportunist.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaycb7b.html?ItemName=Disarm%20Partner">Disarm Partner</a>, base attack bonus +5.

Benefit:  When an ally with this feat fails a disarm combat maneuver check made on his turn against a foe that's within your melee reach, you can make an attack of opportunity against that foe. If that attack of opportunity hits the foe, you can also attempt a disarm combat maneuver check against that opponent as part of that attack of opportunity.
