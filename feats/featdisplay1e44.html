In your pious hands, your holy symbol is a shining light of faith.

Prerequisites: Good alignment, worshiper of a good deity.

Benefit:  Any round in which you use your holy symbol as a divine focus for the casting of a spell or to channel positive energy, you count as presenting a holy symbol, chanting prayers, or ringing a hand bell for the purpose of keeping vampires at bay.
