Despite your non-mythic nature, you're a vital part of the greater mythic world.

Prerequisites: You must be non-mythic.

Benefit:  You're considered a mythic creature for the purposes of determining how mythic spells and effects affect you. If you ever become mythic, you gain a +1 bonus on all saves against mythic spells and effects.
