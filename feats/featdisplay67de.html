Possess Object - Feats







Possess Object (Monster)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy8b9h">Pathfinder #28: The Infernal Syndrome pg. 58</a>
A fiend gains the power to bind its malign essence to a single object, corrupting it into a relic of undeniable evil.

Prerequisites: Cha 18, any evil outsider with 9 or more Hit Dice.

Benefit: Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend can possess a Large or smaller object. Unattended, a mundane object receives no saving throw against possession, while an attended object uses its owner's saving throw to make a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier. Magic items save as if they were subject to a spell. Items within the area of effect of a <a href="spelldisplaye3ec.html?ItemName=hallow">hallow</a> spell cannot be possessed. This effect is similar to that detailed in the <a href="featdisplayb1f8.html?ItemName=Possess%20Creature">Possess Creature</a> feat, except that objects do not receive a daily save to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's <a href="rules044d.html?Name=Possession%20Actions&amp;Category=Possession">possession points</a> can only be spent on object-possession actions.

Should a possessed object be destroyed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in an adjacent space, and is stunned for 1 round. <a href="spelldisplay136a.html?ItemName=Dispel%20evil">Dispel evil</a> (or <a href="spelldisplay4d78.html?ItemName=dispel%20chaos">dispel chaos</a> or <a href="spelldisplay977b.html?ItemName=dispel%20law">dispel law</a>, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. <a href="spelldisplaycdcc.html?ItemName=Banishment">Banishment</a> and <a href="spelldisplayeb0a.html?ItemName=dismissal">dismissal</a> immediately eject a fiend from an object if it fails to make its saving throw against the spell's effects.
