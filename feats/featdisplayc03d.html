Sly Draw

You can draw your weapon with such speed and finesse that your opponents don't realize they're threatened.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw.</a>

Benefit: When you draw a light weapon, you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of a Bluff check to feint in combat. Other feats and abilities that affect a feint still apply to your feint.
