Creatures who cross your path find themselves tripping over their own feet.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, <a href="featdisplay0eea.html?ItemName=Underfoot">Underfoot</a>, goblin, Small size or smaller.

Benefit:  When you successfully make an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from a larger opponent when you move through its threatened area or its space, you can make that opponent lose its balance until the end of its next turn as a free action. While that creature's balance is lost, if it attempts to move, it must make a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall prone, wasting the move action. You can only affect one creature with this effect each round.

When you make an opponent lose its balance with this feat, you can spend 2 stamina points to increase the DC of its Acrobatics check to avoid falling prone to 20.
