Disengaging Feint (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 96</a>
You can feint to disengage from combat.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplayed67.html?ItemName=Improved%20Feint">Improved Feint.</a>

Benefit:  As a standard action, use Bluff to feint against an opponent. Instead of denying that opponent his Dexterity bonus to AC, a successful feint allows you to move up to your speed without provoking an attack of opportunity from the opponent you feinted for leaving the square you start in.

You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. You can spend 5 stamina points to attempt a Disengaging Feint as a move action instead of a standard action.
