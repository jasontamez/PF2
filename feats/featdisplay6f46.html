Sling Flail (Combat)

You can use your loaded sling to effectively strike at nearby foes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (sling)</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  You can make melee attacks using your loaded sling, using that weapon's normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a sling in this way does not expend mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.

Special:  Any feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded sling as a melee weapon.

You can spend 2 stamina points to increase the damage dealt by the melee attacks you make with a loaded sling as if your sling were one size category larger than its actual size. For example, a Small sling would deal 1d4 points of damage, while a Medium one would deal 1d6. This benefit lasts until the start of your next turn, and doesn't stack with other effects that treat the sling as a larger size category unless they increase the sling's actual size.
