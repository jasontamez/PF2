Pattern Message

You've become skilled at inserting secret messages into your pattern illusions.

Prerequisites: Caster level 3rd.

Benefit: When you cast a spell from the pattern subschool, you can embed a short message within the effect. You designate any number of the spell's targets to receive this encoded message, regardless of language, but only a creature failing its save against your pattern spell can receive your message. This message is delivered visually, and there is no verbal component that other creatures might overhear. During each round you concentrate to maintain a pattern spell, you can change the embedded message and the targets that receive it.
