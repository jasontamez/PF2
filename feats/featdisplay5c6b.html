You can make a high, arcing shot to strike your opponents from above.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb19b.html?ItemName=Far%20Shot">Far Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot.</a>

Benefit:  While making a ranged attack, you can ignore any cover bonuses to AC, including total cover, unless the target also has cover from above, such as a roof or forest canopy. When using this feat, treat your target as if it were one range increment farther away. You can't use this feat unless you have headroom equal to at least half the attack's range.
