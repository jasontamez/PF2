Your animal companion is your most treasured friend, and you steadfastly protect it from your foes.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Handle Animal 1 rank, must have an animal companion.

Benefit: When you are adjacent to your animal companion and an attack is made against it, if you are also adjacent to the attacking creature, you can attempt a Handle Animal check as an immediate action to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Handle Animal check result is greater than the attacker's attack roll.

Special: You cannot use this style if you are mounted on your animal companion.
