Stunning Critical (Combat, Critical)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 135</a>
Your critical hits cause opponents to become stunned.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a20.html?ItemName=Staggering%20Critical">Staggering Critical</a>, base attack bonus +17.

Benefit: Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes stunned for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.

Special: You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.

When you confirm a critical hit and attempt to stun an opponent with this feat, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to increase the DC of this feat's saving throw by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
