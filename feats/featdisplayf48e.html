You easily tear your enemies limb from limb with your natural attacks.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6, rend special attack.

Benefit:  You deal rend damage if you hit with half the normal natural attacks your rend requires. For example, a troll that has this feat can rend when it hits with one claw attack, while a girallon that has this feat must hit one target with two claw attacks to rend. You can only make this rend attack once per round.

When you make a rend attack, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to deal an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of stamina points you spent.
