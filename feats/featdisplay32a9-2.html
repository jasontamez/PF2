You can use the momentum of your mount to carry your weapon through one foe and into another.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat</a>, <a href="featdisplaycbce.html?ItemName=Ride-By%20Attack">Ride-By Attack</a>, Ride 3 ranks.

Benefit: When you use the Ride-By Attack feat, if your attack hits, you can also make an attack against a target adjacent to your original target. You take a -5 penalty on this additional attack, which does not benefit from any effects of a charge.
