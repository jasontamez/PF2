The fury you harbor for your fiendish ancestors gives evil outsiders great reason to fear you.

Prerequisites: Intimidate 5 ranks, tiefling.

Benefit:  Whenever you successfully demoralize an outsider of the evil subtype with an Intimidate check, it becomes sickened for 1 round in addition to being affected by the normal effects of being demoralized. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, the creature is nauseated for 1 round instead.

Normal:  Demoralizing a foe with a successful Intimidate check causes it to become shaken for 1 round, +1 round for every 5 by which you beat the DC.
