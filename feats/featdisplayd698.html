You can use your favored weapons in unconventional ways.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  When wielding a weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you can shift your grip as a swift action so that your weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage instead of the damage type normally dealt by that weapon. You may switch back to the weapon's normal damage type or another damage type as a swift action. If your base attack bonus is +5 or higher, using this feat is a free action instead.
