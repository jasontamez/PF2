Al-Zabriti-Trained Horse

This horse was trained by the Al-Zabriti tribespeople. It knows more tricks and is more loyal to its rider than most mounts.

Prerequisites: Horse.

Benefit: This horse automatically knows the tricks included in the combat riding trick (attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel), and these tricks do not count against the normal maximum number of tricks the horse can learn. The Handle Animal DC to get the horse to perform a trick is reduced by 5, and the DC to teach the horse new tricks is reduced by 5.
