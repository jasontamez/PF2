Sometimes, you have to break things if you want people to get your point.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, Intimidate 1 rank.

Benefit:  As a standard action, you can attempt to smash an unattended inanimate object while attempting an Intimidate check (see Smashing an Object, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 173). If you break the object, you gain a bonus to the Intimidate check equal to half its hardness (minimum +1). If you destroy the object, the bonus is equal to its hardness (minimum +1). Creatures intimidated by this feat cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.
