You can expend a large portion of your channeling power to reverse death itself.

Prerequisites: Channel energy 6d6 (positive energy).

Benefit:  As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can expend three uses of your channel energy class feature to restore a dead creature to life as if you had cast the breath of life spell (Core Rulebook 251).
