You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefit of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. If your retributive trip combat maneuver from Drag Down succeeds by 10 or more, you can spend 5 stamina points to stand up from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity as part of the same immediate action as the trip attempt.
