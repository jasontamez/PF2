When you take off, you create a burst of wind that keeps foes from attacking you.

Prerequisites: Fly 5 ranks.

Benefit: When you use your fly speed to leave the ground, you can create a blast of wind. Each creature that threatens you cannot make attacks of opportunities as you move away unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + your skill ranks in Fly + your Dexterity modifier). A creature that fail this Reflex save by 10 or more is knocked prone. You must begin your move action standing on the ground to use this ability.
