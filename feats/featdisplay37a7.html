You possess some of the qualities of your dragon ancestors.

Prerequisites: Kobold.

Benefit:  Your scales take on the color and some of the resistances of one of the chromatic dragons. Choose one of the following chromatic dragon types: black (acid), blue (electricity), green (acid), red (fire), or white (cold). Your scales take on the color of that dragon, and you gain resistance 5 to the dragon color's corresponding energy type.

Special:  If you have the dragon-scaled racial trait, your scale color does not change and you gain a +1 natural armor bonus instead.
