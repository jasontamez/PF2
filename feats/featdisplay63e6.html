Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7f89.html?ItemName=Technologist">Technologist</a>, Heal 9 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 9 ranks

Benefit:  You can create any pharmaceutical or poison. Creating a pharmaceutical takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less; otherwise, the creation of the pharmaceutical takes 1 day for every 1,000 gp in its price. To create the pharmaceutical or poison, you must use up raw materials costing half of this total price. See Crafting High-Tech Items on page 16 for more information.
