You know people and things that interact with the underworld, whether through crime syndicate connections or friends that literally dwell beneath the surface.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on all Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks and Survival checks while underground or in urban terrain. Additionally, while within a settlement and attempting a check modified by that settlement's corruption, crime, or economy modifiers (see Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 205), you can use your knowledge of local contacts to gain a +4 bonus on that roll. However, if the check fails, anyone witnessing your attempt sees you committing some violation of local law.
