The spirit finds ways to heal the body, guided by your faith.

Prerequisites: Cha 11, Psychic Sensitivity or the ability to cast psychic spells, Heal 3 ranks.

Benefit:  As an additional use of the faith healing skill unlock, you can attempt to manipulate a creature's psychic form to heal damage to its physical form. This works as the treat deadly wounds use of the Heal skill, but also grants the creature a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage healed. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. Psychic healing doesn't require a healer's kit. A creature can benef it from psychic healing only once per day, and can't benef it from both this ability and treat deadly wounds in the same day.
