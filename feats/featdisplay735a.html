You have mastered a specialized and complex technique to ignore pain by focusing your belief on the self rather than relying on faith.

Prerequisites: Cannot have a patron deity.

Benefit: Once per day when you have half your total hit points or fewer, you may heal yourself of an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus your total Hit Dice as a move action. This is a supernatural ability.

Special: You can take this feat more than once. Each time you do, you may heal yourself one additional time per day.
