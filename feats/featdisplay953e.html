Using the same divine energy as your lay on hands ability, you can heal others at a distance.

Prerequisites: Lay on hands class feature.

Benefit:  You may use your lay on hands to heal another creature at a range of 30 feet as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You must be able to speak and have a free hand to use this ability. The target heals half the amount they would have healed if you had touched them, but gains the benefits of your mercies as normal.
