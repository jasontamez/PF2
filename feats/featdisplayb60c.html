Quick reflexes turn missed strikes into second chances.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  When making a full attack, if you miss on your first attack, you can forgo making any other attacks for the rest of your turn to reroll that attack at your highest base attack bonus.

You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. After you use Second Chance, you can spend 5 stamina points to still make an attack at your second-highest attack bonus after rerolling your first attack.
