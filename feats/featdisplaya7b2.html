Dynasty Founder (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Quests-Campaigns">Quests and Campaigns pg. 9</a>
You will claim rulership of a city, whether under a larger
government or independently.

Prerequisites: You must have lived in the chosen city for
at least 1 year or be the heir of a former city leader.

Benefit: You gain followers as if you had the Leadership
feat, although you cannot attract followers of a level
higher than your level - 2. If you also have the Leadership
feat, increase your Leadership score by 3 for the purpose
of determining how many followers you have.

Goal: Thwart all rivals to rulership over the chosen
region, including at least one challenging foe.

Completion Benefit: You gain control of the settlement
(see the settlement rules in the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery
Guide). Upon gaining this benefit and once per year
thereafter, you can attempt to alter the settlement in one of
the following ways by attempting a DC 25 Diplomacy check
modified by the settlement's Society modifier or a DC 25
Intimidate check modified by its Law modifier:
<ul><li>Move the settlement's alignment 1 step closer to yours
along either the good-evil or law-chaos axis.
</li><li>Replace one settlement quality with another.
</li><li>Change the government type.
</li><li>Significantly alter the laws.</li></ul>
Failure indicates that popular opinion in the city
successfully opposes you.

In addition, from now on, your followers gain a +1
morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws as long
as they can see you.

Special: For groups using the kingdom-building
rules from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign, you can
optionally use the rules for establishing a settlement to
complete the goal of this story feat.


Suggested Traits: Domineering, Inspiring, Natural-
Born Leader.
