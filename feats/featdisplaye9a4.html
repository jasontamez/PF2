You learn how to create one kind of ranger trap.


Prerequisites: Survival 5 ranks.

Benefit:  Select one ranger trap (see page 20). You may use
this trap a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom
bonus (minimum 1). The DC for your trap is equal to 10 +
1/2 your character's level + your Wisdom bonus, and it lasts
1 day per 2 character levels.

If you aren't a ranger, you can only set extraordinary
traps with this feat; like all extraordinary ranger traps,
this decreases the trap's DC by 2.


Special:  A ranger can use ranger traps a number of times
per day equal to 1/2 his ranger level + his Wisdom bonus.
See the description of ranger traps for durations.
