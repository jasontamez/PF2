You can fire your weapon and strike with it at the same time.

Prerequisites: Grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger feat, pistol-whip deed.

Benefit:  Whenever you use your pistol-whip deed, you can fire a single bullet from your firearm at the same time that you strike a foe with the butt of your firearm. You must spend a total of 2 grit points to use the pistol-whip deed in this way, and must still succeed at a ranged touch attack against the target of your pistolwhip deed to hit. You cannot use the scatter weapon quality of a firearm when you use this feat.
