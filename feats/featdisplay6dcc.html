Your fingers are so nimble that reloading your sling is almost effortless for you.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7320.html?ItemName=Ammo%20Drop">Ammo Drop</a>, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, proficient with sling.

Benefit: You can load a sling or double sling as a free action. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. This feat allows you to fire your sling as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.
