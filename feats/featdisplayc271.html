Quick momentary meditation allows you to gain insight in combat.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplayade4.html?ItemName=Meditation%20Master">Meditation Master</a>, character level 5th.

Benefit:  You can meditate as a full-round action. If you do, you gain all the benefits of your meditation feats, but they last for only 1 round per character level. Combat meditation allows you to expend the +1 insight bonus granted from the Meditation Master feat to instead roll twice when attempting an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better of the two results. You must decide to use this ability before the initial roll is made. You may only use this alternate ability in place of bonuses granted by the Meditation Master feat. You can perform combat meditation a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.
