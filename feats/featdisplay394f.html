Your vast knowledge of opponents lets you more effectively cast spells on them.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana, dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 5 ranks, caster level 7th.

Benefit: When you select this feat, choose one Knowledge skill in which you have at least 5 ranks. When you succeed at a check with that Knowledge skill to identify a creature's abilities and weaknesses, you can learn one less piece of information in order to gain a +3 bonus on caster level checks to overcome that creature's spell resistance (if any). If you have 10 or more ranks in the selected Knowledge skill, you can learn two fewer pieces of information to increase this bonus to +5.

Normal: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, you must select a different Knowledge skill.
