You can spin and juggle a small firearm, making it difficult to predict where you will shoot.

Prerequisites: Amateur Gunslinger feat or grit class feature, <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus.</a>

Benefit:  You can spend 1 grit point to make a feint attempt using a one-handed firearm for which you have Weapon Focus (instead of a melee weapon). The target of this feint must be within 30 feet of you and be able to see you.

If you have the Quick Draw feat, you can holster a onehanded firearm as a free action as long as you have at least 1 grit point.
