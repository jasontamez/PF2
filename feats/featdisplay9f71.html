You can pull in foes with your whip and then attack them with your sword.

Note: This description is identical to the one from Improved Balor Whip and likely a mistake; the Archives will be updated if and when a correction is released.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc732.html?ItemName=Balor%20Whip">Balor Whip</a>, <a href="featdisplayefef.html?ItemName=Improved%20Balor%20Whip">Improved Balor Whip</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (whip)</a>, <a href="featdisplayf000.html?ItemName=Whip%20Mastery">Whip Mastery</a>, base attack bonus +16.
