Your summoned minions are infused with the power of the moon.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (conjuration)</a>, able to cast summon nature's ally.

Benefit:  Creatures you summon shed light as a light spell. They are immune to confusion and sleep effects, and their natural weapons are treated as silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
