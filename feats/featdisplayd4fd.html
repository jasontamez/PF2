Lunge (Combat)

You can strike foes that would normally be out of reach.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: You can increase the reach of your melee attacks by 5 feet until the end of your turn by taking a -2 penalty to your AC until your next turn. You must decide to use this ability before any attacks are made.

When you use this feat, you can spend 2 stamina points to avoid taking the -2 penalty to AC for that use.

Mythic Lunge

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 69</a>
Your reaching strikes aid your defenses against those you hit.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayd4fd.html?ItemName=Lunge">Lunge.</a>

Benefit:  Whenever you use Lunge and hit a creature with the melee attack, you no longer take a -2 penalty to AC against that creature. You can expend one use of mythic power when you use Lunge to negate the -2 penalty to AC whether you hit or miss, and gain a +2 bonus on attacks of opportunity you make while Lunge is in effect.
