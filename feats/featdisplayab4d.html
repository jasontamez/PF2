You can quickly retrieve items from the body of a companion who is unable to act.

Benefit: If you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat but is unable to act, you can retrieve a held or openly carried item from his body as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Normal: Retrieving a stored item or picking up a fallen item is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Special: This is an exception to the rule that allies who are unable to act do not count for the purpose of teamwork feats.
