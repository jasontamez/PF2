You were touched by nature at an early age and share a kinship with wild creatures. Your body might bear animalistic features, such as bestial ears or a tail, or your presence may be subtly unlike that of others.

Prerequisites: Any neutral alignment, must be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: You gain the druid's wild empathy ability, using your character level as your druid level. If you have one or more levels in a class that grants wild empathy, you gain an additional +3 bonus on wild empathy checks. You are treated as an animal for the purpose of harmful mind-affecting effects that target animals (such as charm animal).

Special: A character who has this feat can select the Animal Soul or Aspect of the Beast feats without meeting the prerequisites.
