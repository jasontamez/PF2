Through the bond of sisterhood, you can inspire your allies to overcome terrible threats.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay4ebc.html?ItemName=Bodyguard">Bodyguard</a>, <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, Perform (oratory) 3 ranks, any good alignment.

Benefit: Whenever an ally within 30 feet attempts a saving throw, you can attempt a DC 10 Perform (oratory) check as an immediate action. If you are successful, the ally gains a +2 morale bonus on her saving throw. This ability has no effect if your ally cannot hear you speak or understand your words.
