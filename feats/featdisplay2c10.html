You offer a path to the Boneyard for the walking dead and restless spirits.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against any haunt or against an undead creature with the resurrection vulnerability weakness. This touch attack deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to the undead creature or haunt (ignoring damage reduction and hardness); a creature damaged this way is staggered for 1 round. You must have detected the haunt with a successful skill check or identified the undead creature with a successful Knowledge (religion) check to use this ability.

You can use this feat's benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes). In addition, the amount of damage you deal with this ability increases by 1d6 for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
