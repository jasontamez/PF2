You have learned to make your summons destructive to the fabric of the planes, bringing blackfire in the wake of your magic.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay4719.html?ItemName=Sacred%20Summons">Sacred Summons</a>.

Benefit: When you summon a single evil outsider, it appears in a flash of blackfire, harming all adjacent nonevil creatures. This deals an amount of damage equal to twice the CR of the summoned creature. An affected creature can attempt a Will save (DC = the DC of the spell used to summon the creature) to halve this damage. A spell augmented with blackfire summoning uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level. <a href="prestigeclassesdisplay2361.html?ItemName=Blackfire%20Adept">If you have the blackfire pact class feature</a>, you can apply the benefits of this feat to summoned outsiders of the type or types you have selected for your blackfire pact without raising the spell's effective level.
