Axiomatic Discourse (Conduit)

You take inspiration from the greatest debaters and speakers of Axis and weave words with precision, limiting misunderstandings and sharpening comprehension.

Prerequisites: Diplomacy 3 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.

Benefit: You can activate this feat's benefits as part of a Diplomacy check to influence a creature's attitude (before determining the outcome). If you fail the Diplomacy check, the target's attitude towards you does not decrease unless you fail the check by 10 or more. Also, you can attempt a Diplomacy check to influence creatures that do not understand your language, but you take a -4 penalty on the check.

Once per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes), you can attempt a Diplomacy check twice and take the better result.
