Your skill at arms intimidates your foes.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +5, Intimidate 1 rank.

Benefit: You can use your base attack bonus in place of your ranks in Intimidate to determine your Intimidate skill bonus. When you confirm a critical hit against a creature, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize that creature as an immediate action.
