You can shield your partner's body with your own.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay37d1.html?ItemName=Bonded%20Mind">Bonded Mind</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  As long as an ally with the Bonded Mind feat is adjacent to you, you can choose to absorb up to half of the hit point damage from any attack that strikes him, as if subject to a shield other spell. Using this ability is an immediate action, and it only applies to one attack, even if the ally is hit by multiple attacks as part of the same action.
