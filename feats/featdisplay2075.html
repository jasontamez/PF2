Your natural empathy stretches across the world of nature.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, wild empathy class feature.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 insight bonus on wild empathy checks, and you may use wild empathy to duplicate an Intimidate check rather than a Diplomacy check. In addition, choose one of the following kinds of creatures: elementals, fey, lycanthropes, plants, or vermin. You may influence creatures of that type with wild empathy, if their Intelligence score is 1 or 2, or they do not possess an Intelligence score. Once you choose the type of creature, it cannot be changed.

Special:  You may select this feat more than once. Each time, you may choose an additional creature type to influence.
