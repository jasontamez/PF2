Benefit:  After sidestepping an opponent's missed attack using the Sidestep feat, you may still take a 5-foot step during your next turn, or you may move up to your full speed if you take an action to move during your next turn.

Normal:  If you use the Sidestep feat, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn.
