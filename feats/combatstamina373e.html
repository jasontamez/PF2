If your successful critical confirmation roll is a natural 19 or 20, you can spend 2 stamina points to roll another confirmation roll. If this confirmation roll also succeeds, increase your critical multiplier by 1 for this attack, and you can roll again. If you continue to roll 19 or 20, you can continue to spend stamina points for additional rolls, and the increases to the critical multiplier stack.
