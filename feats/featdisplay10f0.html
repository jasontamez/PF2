You can change your wings to instead be effective underwater.

Prerequisites: Gathlain, racial fly speed.

Benefit: Once per day as a full-round action, you can lose your fly speed to gain a swim speed of 30 feet as you reconfigure your symbiotic vines to help you move underwater. This effect lasts for 1 hour, or until you end it as a full-round action.
