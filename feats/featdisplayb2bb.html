Object of Legend (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Quests-Campaigns">Quests and Campaigns pg. 16</a>
The object of your quest drives you ever forward.

Prerequisites: You must have some highly personal
stake in attaining the object of your quest as determined
collectively by you and the GM'such as needing an
ancestral weapon to exact your revenge against a known
betrayer, seeking to destroy the artifact that caused your
family's downfall generations ago, or attempting to behead
a monster that ravaged your homeland during your youth.

Benefit: When you gain this feat, select one of the quest
objects on this page or the facing page, or devise a quest
object with your GM based on the quest objects presented in
this section. You gain a +2 bonus on any Knowledge checks
to gain information on the object of your quest. If you have
10 or more ranks in the Knowledge skill in question, the
bonus increases to +4. In addition, once per day when you
threaten a critical hit against a foe who specifically aims to
stop you from completing your quest, you gain a +10 bonus
on your confirmation roll against that opponent. You
must announce the use of this ability after threatening the
critical hit and before rolling your confirmation roll. This
bonus does not stack with bonuses on confirmation rolls
from other feats, such as Critical Focus.

Goal: Attain the object of your quest, as determined by
you and the GM upon taking this feat. This likely means
decidedly obtaining the item for yourself, though in some
cases (such as when the quest object is more abstract
or intangible) this might mean slaying a certain foe,
achieving a certain honor, or completing some other set of
predetermined objectives.

Completion Benefit: You gain renown throughout a
region, perhaps even an entire continent. You are sung of
in bardic tales and can be the subject of spells such as legend
lore, regardless of your actual level. Commoners in nearby
lands know of your deeds, and your reputation precedes you
in numerous lands. In addition, you gain a specific benefit
keyed to the object of your quest. See the quest objects in this
section for examples of completion benefits when devising
your own quest objects for use with this feat.

Special: This feat may be taken more than once. Each
time it is taken, select a new quest object to strive for. As
with all story feats, a character cannot take this feat again
until she has completed the goal of the feat's first iteration.


Axe of the Dwarvish Lords


Completion Benefit: Capturing the legendary Axe
of the Dwarvish Lords from the dragon Moschabbatt
(see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Dragons Unleashed )
proves your worth to the dwarven people. As long as
you wield the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, you gain a +4
bonus on Charisma-based skill checks with dwarves.


Chronicle of the Righteous


Completion Benefit: The secrets of Heaven and the other goodly Outer Planes are now known to you. You gain the completion benefits of the Blessed story feat (see page 8).


Linnorm Head


Completion Benefit: Slaying a linnorm in the
northlands of Avistan enables you to become a ruler
in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. You gain favored
enemy (dragon) +2 , as the ranger class feature of t he
same name. T his bonus stacks with favored enemy
bonuses granted by other sources.


Red Mantis Hit List


Completion Benefit: By stealing a comprehensive list
of all the targets slain and being kept dead by the Red
Mantis assassins, you gain insights into their deadliest
secrets. You gain Exotic Weapon Proficiency (sawtooth
sabre) and Weapon Focus (sawtooth sabre) as bonus feats.

elixir and restoring your youth, you completely lose
your fear of physical harm. You gain a +2 bonus on saves
against Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution damage.

from a deck of many things, you produce a fortress like
Castle Everstand in Lastwall (see Pathfinder Campaign
Setting: Castles of the Inner Sea), using it as the seat for
your new nation. You gain a +4 bonus on Stability
checks and control checks while using the kingdom-building rules from Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign.
