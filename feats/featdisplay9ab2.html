Greater Steal (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 162</a>
You have a knack for snatching items from your opponents in combat.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplayf149.html?ItemName=Improved%20Steal">Improved Steal</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to steal an item from a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Steal. If you successfully steal an item from a foe during combat, it does not notice the theft until after combat is over or if it attempts to use the missing item.

Normal:  Creatures automatically notice items taken from them through the steal combat maneuver.

You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When attempting a steal combat maneuver with a whip, you can spend 2 stamina points to negate the -4 penalty on the check.
