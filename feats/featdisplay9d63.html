This creature can use one of its spell-like abilities with next to no effort.

Prerequisites: Spell-like ability at CL 10th or higher.

Benefit:  Choose one of the creature's spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. The creature can use the chosen spell-like ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

Using a quickened spell-like ability is a swift action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action-including the use of another spell-like ability (but not another swift action)-in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round.

The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 4. For a summary, see the table below.

A spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.

<table class="inner"><tr><td> Spell Level</td><td> Caster Level to Empower</td><td> Caster Level to Quicken</td></tr> <tr><td>0</td><td>4th</td><td>8th</td></tr> <tr><td>1st</td><td>6th</td><td>10th</td></tr> <tr><td>2nd</td><td>8th</td><td>12th</td></tr> <tr><td>3rd</td><td>10th</td><td>14th</td></tr> <tr><td>4th</td><td>12th</td><td>16th</td></tr> <tr><td>5th</td><td>14th</td><td>18th</td></tr> <tr><td>6th</td><td>16th</td><td>20th</td></tr> <tr><td>7th</td><td>18th</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>8th</td><td>20th</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>9th</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

Normal:  The use of a spell-like ability normally requires a standard action (at the very least) and provokes an attack of opportunity.

Special:  This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the creature can apply it to a different one of its spell-like abilities.
