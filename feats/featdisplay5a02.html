You lend some of your oracular powers to the leaders of Po Li in their search for the reborn Eternal Emperor, learning useful techniques to extend your divinations.

Prerequisites: Enlarge Spell or Extend Spell, oracle's curse class feature.

Benefit: Treat your oracle level as 1 lower (minimum 1st level) when determining the effects of your oracle's curse. You don't require additional time to spontaneously cast divination spells modified by the Enlarge Spell or Extend Spell metamagic feats.

Normal: Applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell increases the casting time of the spell.
