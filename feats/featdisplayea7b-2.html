You balance your armor expertly, allowing you to run and sprint without impediment.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay871d.html?ItemName=Swift%20Iron%20Style">Swift Iron Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay99e1.html?ItemName=Swift%20Refuge">Swift Refuge</a>, proficiency with medium armor.

Benefit: When you're charging, running, or taking no action in your turn other than movement, your armor does not reduce your movement.
