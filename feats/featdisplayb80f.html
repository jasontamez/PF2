With a little work, you can convincingly disguise yourself as an animal.

Prerequisites: Disguise 6 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 6 ranks.

Benefit: You can use Disguise to disguise yourself as an animal of your size category. You must have an appropriate pelt and any other animal parts needed to complete the disguise. You also gain a +2 bonus on Disguise checks when you disguise yourself as an animal. Creatures with ranks in Knowledge (nature) can use that skill in place of Sense Motive to detect this type of disguise.
