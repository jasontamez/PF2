By studying other planes, you've learned to take on aspects of outsiders as well as animals.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks, animal focus class feature.

Benefit:  When you use your animal focus class feature, you can choose any of the following new aspects unless they conflict with your alignment.

Air: You gain a constant feather fall effect. At 10th level, you instead gain a constant levitate effect.

Earth: You gain a burrow speed equal to your base land speed, and a +2 enhancement bonus to your natural armor.
Evil: You gain a +1 profane bonus to AC and on saves against attacks made and effects created by good outsiders. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. Only evil characters can use this planar focus.
Fire: Your natural attacks and melee weapons deal 1d6 points of fire damage for every 4 class levels you possess.
Good: You gain a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on saves against attacks made or effects created by evil outsiders. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. Only good characters can use this planar focus.
