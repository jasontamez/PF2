Your familiarity with summoning creatures has taught you how to send them away with a well-timed strike.

Prerequisites: Arcane Strike or Disruptive; Spellcraft 8 ranks; arcane pool class feature.

Benefit:  When you confirm a critical hit against a target while using Arcane Strike or with a weapon enhanced by your arcane pool, if the target was summoned by a spell you identified using a Spellcraft check, it must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Intelligence modifier) or be sent back to its home plane as per the dismissal spell.
