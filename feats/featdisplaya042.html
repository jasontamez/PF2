Mobility - Feats







Mobility (Combat)

You can easily move through a dangerous melee.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge.</a>

Benefit: You get a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

Dodge bonuses stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.

Your dodge bonus to AC from the Dodge feat combat trick is doubled against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement. If you don't have the Dodge feat, you can still use its combat trick.

Mythic Mobility

You have perfected your ability to weave through the battlefield, using your momentum to propel yourself far.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility.</a>

Benefit:  Whenever you use Mobility, you gain a +6 dodge bonus to AC instead of the normal +4. In addition, once per round when an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement misses you, you may move 5 feet as a free action. This movement doesn't count against your total overall movement for the round, but it does provoke attacks of opportunity.
