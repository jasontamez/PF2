You can make powerful attacks that place more of your weapon's poison into a target's wounds.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>; Craft (poison) 3 ranks or poison use class feature.

Benefit:  When you damage an opponent with a Power Attack while using a poisoned weapon, you can forgo the bonus damage from Power Attack to increase the save DC of the poison by 1. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every +4 thereafter, the bonus to the poison's save DC increases by an additional 1. This can't cause the save DC to exceed 15 + 1/2 your character level.
