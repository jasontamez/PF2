In times of need, you have the answers.

Prerequisites: Int 17, <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Knowledge [any])</a>, worshiper of Irori.

Benefit:  Choose a single Knowledge skill with which you have Skill Focus. Once per day, when you wish to make a check with that Knowledge skill, you need not roll, and may treat the result as if you had rolled a natural 20 instead.
