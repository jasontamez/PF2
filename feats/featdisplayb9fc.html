Your focus allows you to smash your enemy's defenses.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist.</a>

Benefit:  You can make a Stunning Fist attempt as a full-round action. If successful, instead of stunning your target, you reduce the target's AC by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with other penalties applied due to Crushing Blow.
