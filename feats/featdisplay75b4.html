You can throw your spiked chain to make trip attacks.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (spiked chain).</a>

Benefit: You may throw your spiked chain (as if it were a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet) and can make trip attacks when throwing it. Failing at this attack does not knock you prone.
