You have experience using a skill while armored.

Prerequisites: Light armor proficiency, medium armor proficiency, 3 ranks in any Dexterity- or Strength-based skill.

Benefit:  Choose one Dexterity- or Strength-based skill in which you possess at least 3 ranks. When you attempt a check for the chosen skill, your armor check penalty on that check for wearing light or medium armor is reduced by 3 (to a minimum of 0). If you have 10 or more ranks in the skill, the penalty is instead reduced by 6 (to a minimum of 0). If you have armor training 2 and are proficient with heavy armor, this benefit also applies to armor check penalties for wearing heavy armor.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new skill.
