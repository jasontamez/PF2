Your body is suffused with elemental air that provides for all your respiratory needs.

Prerequisites: Character level 11th, sylph.

Benefit:  You no longer need to breathe. You are immune to effects that require breathing (such as inhaled poison). This does not give you immunity to cloud or gas attacks that do not require breathing, such as cloudkill.
