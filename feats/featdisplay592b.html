You disorient your opponents by pushing and pounding them mercilessly, just like how the sea beats relentlessly against the rocks.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, <a href="featdisplay0d81.html?ItemName=Crashing%20Wave%20Style">Crashing Wave Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay3380.html?ItemName=Improved%20Drag">Improved Drag</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Reposition">Improved Reposition</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: When dragging or repositioning an opponent, you use your full body to knock your opponent around like a constant wave. At the end of the drag or reposition maneuver, your opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier + 2 for every 5 feet you drag or reposition your opponent). On a failed save, your opponent becomes disorientated from the movement and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, and Dexterity-based skill checks until the end of its next turn.
