Though you might not be able to trace your lineage back to Azlant, you can feel the ancient power in your blood whenever you're near others like yourself.

Prerequisites: Human (Chelaxian or Taldan).

Benefit:  While you're adjacent to an ethnically Chelish or Taldan ally who also has this feat, you gain a +2 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check as an immediate action. You must choose to use this ability before making the roll.
