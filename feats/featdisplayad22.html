Your many visits to the Hao Jin Tapestry demiplane have
made you an expert in long-distance travel.


Prerequisites: Character level 5th.

Benefit:  You cast spells of the
teleportation subschool as though
your caster level were 2 higher, and
you treat yourself as one step more
familiar when teleporting to an established
Pathfinder lodge with the teleport spell. If you can
teleport as a supernatural ability, you treat your class
level as if it were 2 higher when calculating the total
distance that you can travel with this ability.
