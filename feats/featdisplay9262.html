Your mystic connection with one type of wilderness has grown even stronger.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayefc5.html?ItemName=Attuned%20to%20the%20Wild">Attuned to the Wild</a>, <a href="featdisplay1cbf.html?ItemName=Guardian%20of%20the%20Wild">Guardian of the Wild</a>, elf.

Benefit:  When you are in a terrain type you have selected the Attuned to the Wild feat for, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks made to act in the surprise round of combat. If you act in the surprise round, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet during the surprise round. If you are in an area that qualifies as more than one kind of terrain, these bonuses do not stack; you receive the bonus for only one terrain type.
