Your critical hits weaken your opponents' defenses.


Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  Whenever you score a critical hit, your
opponent takes a -1 penalty to its natural armor bonus
for the duration of the encounter. This penalty is
cumulative, but cannot reduce an opponent's natural
armor bonus below 0.
