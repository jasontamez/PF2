Focused Outsider Expertise - Feats







Focused Outsider Expertise (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s7z">Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 23</a>
You've learned to attack in a way that stymies the natural resistances common in outsiders.

Prerequisites: Favored enemy (outsider) class feature.

Benefit: Your weapon attacks ignore a number of points of damage reduction equal to half your favored enemy (outsider [any one]) bonus. This feat allows you to ignore only damage reduction that is normally bypassed by chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons. Against outsiders that match your favored enemy subtype, the amount of damage reduction and hardness you ignore is equal to your full favored class bonus.
