Your nearly supernatural mental connection with your allies keeps you in a constant state of readiness.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb423.html?ItemName=Alertness">Alertness</a>, Sense Motive 3 ranks, human (Vudrani).

Benefit:  Whenever you're adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, if your ally is not flat-footed, you're also not considered flat-footed before you act in combat (you might become flat-footed in other ways, however). Additionally, if your ally can see a creature that you can't see, that creature doesn't gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against you from being invisible, nor do you take a -2 penalty to AC for being blinded if your ally can see.
