You can strike multiple opponents with thrown weapons.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay10f7.html?ItemName=Startoss%20Comet">Startoss Comet</a>, <a href="featdisplay1143-2.html?ItemName=Startoss%20Style">Startoss Style</a>, Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit:  When you hit an opponent while using the Startoss Comet feat, you can continue to make attacks against foes that are within one range increment of all previous opponents. You determine cover for each attack from the most recently hit foe's space instead of your space, and you cannot attack an individual foe more than once during this attack action. You can make a maximum number of attacks equal to 1 + 1 per 5 points of base attack bonus you possess. If you have Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike, you can add the additional damage from those feats to the initial ranged attack (but not any subsequent attacks).
