You are practiced at avoiding attacks when outnumbered.

Prerequisites: Int 13.

Benefit:  If you are the only character threatening an opponent, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent.

Special:  The Artful Dodge feat acts as the Dodge feat for the purpose of satisfying prerequisites that require Dodge. You can use Intelligence, rather than Dexterity, for feats with a minimum Dexterity prerequisite.
