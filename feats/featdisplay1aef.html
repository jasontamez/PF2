A familiar is more than just an animal. It's a spirit and an intelligence, and your familiar can choose to take more than one physical form.

Prerequisites: Familiar class feature, caster level 7th.

Benefit: Your familiar gains the <a href="umrd354.html?ItemName=Change%20Shape">change shape</a> universal monster ability. This ability functions as <a href="spelldisplayecf3.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20II">beast shape II</a> and grants access to a single alternate form, which must be the same size as the familiar. Once chosen, this form cannot be changed.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, your familiar gains an additional alternate form. If taken by a familiar that already has the change shape universal monster ability (like an <a href="monsterdisplay4a88.html?ItemName=Imp">imp</a>), this grants a single additional form.
