You knock your opponents into each other, using one enemy to shove aside another.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Reposition">Improved Reposition</a>, <a href="featdisplay221a.html?ItemName=Whipcrack">Whipcrack</a>, base attack bonus +6 or <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">monk level 3rd</a>.

Benefit: When you successfully reposition an opponent, if you attempt to reposition it into a square already occupied by another creature, you can attempt a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to reposition that creature. You take a -4 penalty on this check. If you are successful, the second creature is pushed 5 feet in the direction of your original target's movement. You can move the secondary target an additional 5 feet for every 5 by which you exceed the secondary target's CMD. The secondary target does not provoke attacks of opportunity because of this movement unless you have the <a href="featdisplay4072.html?ItemName=Greater%20Reposition">Greater Reposition</a> feat. If you fail your combat maneuver check, the movement of your original target ends in front of the secondary target.

Normal: You can't reposition a creature into a square that is occupied by a solid object or obstacle.
