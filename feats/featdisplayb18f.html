The animal's devotion to its master allows it to stand against unnatural forces.

Prerequisites: Animal companion, devotion special ability.

Benefit: The animal companion gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of aberrations, outsiders, and undead. The animal companion is immune to the unnatural aura ability that some undead creatures (such as wraiths) have.
