When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt to bull rush the target anyway. If you do, reroll the confirmation roll to determine if the bull rush attempt exceeds the opponent's CMD. This reroll is only for the bull rush combat maneuver; it can't cause the critical hit to be confirmed. You still can't make the attempt if the target is immune to critical hits.
