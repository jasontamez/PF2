Your family has raised cities and mastered trade, and you seek to do the same.

Prerequisites: Be a member of House Corcina, or have the Craftsperson, Inheritance, Well-Connected Friend, or Worldshaker background.

Benefit: When in a settlement the size of a large city or smaller, you receive a +2 bonus on Appraise checks and Diplomacy checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus on that skill increases to +4.

Goal: Your actions must spur a settlement to grow to the next <a href="rulesb3cf.html?Name=Settlement%20Population%20Ranges&amp;Category=Urban">size category</a>; this usually involves decisively defeating a challenging foe or an appropriate number of foes preying upon or impeding the settlement's citizenry.

Completion Benefit: You teach others how to get the most out of their equipment. Three times per day as a standard action, you can increase the armor bonus provided by a suit of nonmagical armor, the circumstance bonus to a skill provided by a tool or skill kit, or the shield bonus provided by a nonmagical shield by 1. This bonus lasts for 1 hour and doesn't stack with other uses of this ability.
