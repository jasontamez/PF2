Scion of the Arts: A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, you can roll 2d20 for a Perform check and take the better result.

Scion of Magic: Once per day, you can gain a +2 bonus to caster level on a concentration check, a Use Magic Device check, or a check to overcome spell resistance.

Scion of Peace: Choose one Wisdom-based skill. Once per day when you take 10 on this skill, you treat the result as if you had rolled an 18 instead of a 10.
