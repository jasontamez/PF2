Your inspired architecture shall make your name immortal.


Prerequisites: Knowledge (engineering) 1 rank, and you
must have built a structure worth at least 5, 000 gp.

Benefit:  When you supervise a construction project or do
the construction yourself, reduce your raw material costs
by 10%. You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (engineering)
checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Knowledge
(engineering), this bonus increases to +4.


Goal:  Design and construct a building worth at least
100,000 gp with great personal significance to you. For
example, you might construct a new temple for your
god on the site where an old temple was destroyed, or an
academy for students to unlock the secrets of the universe.


Completion Benefit:  The value of any past and
future buildings you construct (including the building
constructed to achieve your goal) increases by 10% as your
reputation spreads. In addition, you and your workers
complete double the normal amount of work in a given
time interval when you supervise a construction project.
