You are quite popular at the pubs you frequent and the bartenders remember you.

Prerequisites: Cha 14.

Benefit: You receive a 10% discount at any tavern after you have spent a cumulative 500 gp there. In addition, if a bar fight occurs in that tavern, you gain a +2 bonus on your checks to use the redirect action. On a round in which you don't attempt the redirect action, the crowd reduces your tenacity by only 1d4 (instead of by the normal amount).
