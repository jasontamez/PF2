Your strikes latch onto your opponent like the jaws of a cerberus, preventing them from fleeing across planes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay9534.html?ItemName=Cerberus%20Style">Cerberus Style</a>, base attack bonus +9 or monk level 9th.

Benefit: Whenever you damage an opponent with <a href="featdisplay9534.html?ItemName=Cerberus%20Style">Cerberus Style</a>, that opponent cannot take 5-foot steps until the beginning of your next turn. Additionally, it is barred from dimensional travel. This effect functions as <a href="spelldisplaybbc0.html?ItemName=dimensional%20anchor">dimensional anchor</a>, except that its duration is 1 round. Spell resistance applies; for the purpose of checks to overcome spell resistance, your caster level is equal to your character level.
