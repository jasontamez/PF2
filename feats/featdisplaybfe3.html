Deadly Trap

Your traps are especially deadly, either through their increased accuracy or the viciousness of their blades and bludgeons.

Prerequisites: Craft (traps) 8 ranks, Survival 8 ranks.

Benefit: If you craft a trap that requires an attack roll to hit, you can either increase the threat multiplier of the trap by 1 (??2 becomes ??3, and so on) or grant the trap's attack a +4 bonus to confirm a critical hit.
