You are adept at vexing multiple foes with your whip.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, proficient in whip.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a disarm or trip maneuver with your whip. If it succeeds, you can make an additional disarm or trip maneuver with the same bonus against a target adjacent to the first and also within your whip's reach.

In addition, you can use your whip to perform reposition maneuvers, though you take a -4 penalty on your CMB and you may only move the target toward you from its original position.

This feat originally appeared in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Osirion, Land of the Pharaohs.
