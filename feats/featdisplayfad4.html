You can convince anyone of her allies' ill intent.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, Deceitful Greater Feint, <a href="featdisplayed67.html?ItemName=Improved%20Feint">Improved Feint</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: When you successfully feint in combat, if you succeed by 5 or more, the target no longer provides flanking to its allies and no longer gains or grants the benefits of teamwork feats until the beginning of your next turn. In addition, when you attempt a Bluff check to lie and the lie implies that one or more of the target's allies have betrayed her or are secretly against her, your lie is one step more believable than normal, from far-fetched to unlikely and from unlikely to believable (if the lie was already less believable than far-fetched, this feat has no effect).
