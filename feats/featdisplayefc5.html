You share a strong mystic connection with one type of wilderness terrain.

Prerequisites: Elf.

Benefit:  Select one type of terrain from the ranger class's favored terrain class feature (except urban). While you are in your selected terrain type, your natural healing rate (the amount of hit points and ability damage you heal from a full night's rest) doubles.

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take it, it applies to a different terrain type.
