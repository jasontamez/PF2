After you have used this feat to enter an opponent's space, if that opponent moves away from you, you can spend stamina points to move along with the opponent. You must spend 2 stamina points per 5 feet you move. The opponent's movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from you if you move with the opponent, nor do you provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way.
