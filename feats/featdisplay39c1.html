You have tattooed the humanoid portion of your skin with a swirling mark that provides you with focus and pride.

Prerequisites: Cecaelia.

Benefit: Select one of the cecaelia focus tattoos below; you gain its benefits while it is active. While you can have any number of focus tattoos, only one can be active at a time. You activate a focus tattoo by concentrating on its importance to you for 1 hour without interruption. Once a focus tattoo is active, it remains so until you activate a new tattoo.

Each time you would gain a favored class bonus, you may forgo that benefit and instead get another tattoo from the Cecaelia Focus Tattoos list. Instead of getting a new tattoo, you can increase the complexity of an existing tattoo by selecting the same tattoo again. You may choose any tattoo multiple times; if you do, its benefits stack while it is active. <table class="inner"> <tr><td>Name</td><td>Effect</td></tr> <tr><td>Aureoln prong</td><td>Increase range of darkvision by 5 feet while on land</td></tr> <tr><td>Cobalt prong</td><td>Increase range of darkvision by 5 feet while underwater</td></tr> <tr><td>Crimson spiral</td><td>+1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves against death effects and on Constitution checks to become stable</td></tr> <tr><td>Emerald helix</td><td>+1 competence bonus on Survival checks while on land</td></tr> <tr><td>Indigo vines</td><td>+1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves against poison delivered by a creature's natural attack</td></tr> <tr><td>Inky whorls</td><td>+1 competence bonus on Stealth checks while on land</td></tr> <tr><td>Silver whorls</td><td>+1 competence bonus on Stealth checks while underwater</td></tr> <tr><td>Teal helix</td><td>+1 competence bonus on Survival checks while underwater</td></tr></table>
