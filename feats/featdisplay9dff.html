The forces of darkness gird you against the light.

Benefit:  You gain defensive abilities related to your patron's outsider subtype. For example, if your patron is a devil, the abilities listed below tie into the devil subtype (see Creature Subtypes, starting on page 310 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). These benefits tie to your patron's subtype, not your specific patron (its abilities might differ from the norm).

One Damnation Feat: Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type.

Two Damnation Feats: Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type. If you already have resistance to the chosen energy type (even from earlier benefits of this feat), this new resistance stacks with the existing resistance.

Three Damnation Feats: Choose one of the energy types to which your patron's outsider subtype grants resistance. You gain immunity to the selected energy type.

Four Damnation Feats: Your creature type changes to outsider (native). Additionally, choose one energy type to which your patron's outsider subtype grants immunity or resistance. You gain immunity to that energy type.
