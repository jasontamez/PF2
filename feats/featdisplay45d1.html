You've mastered the art of dismissing certain spells when they become a problem for you or your allies.

Benefit: You can dismiss any pit spell (such as create pit, hungry pit, spiked pit, and similar spells with "pit" in their names) or wall spell (such as wall of fire, wall of ice, and similar spells with "wall" in their names) you cast. The spells must have a duration of at least 1 round. This ability follows the normal rules for dismissing spells, allowing you to dismiss conjured pits and walls as a standard action.

Normal: Several pit and wall spells cannot be dismissed without the use of this feat.
