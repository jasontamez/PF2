Like a deadly predator, you bolt at unsuspecting foes from below.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay5de8.html?ItemName=Shark%20Style">Shark Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay7231.html?ItemName=Shark%20Tear">Shark Tear</a>, Swim 10 ranks, base attack bonus +10 or monk level 10th.

Benefit: While in Shark Style, when you're underwater with neutral, rising, or swiftly rising buoyancy, you can perform a terrifying leap to attack opponents directly above you. This works similarly to the charge action, except you can move only straight up, and you make a single piercing unarmed strike or bite attack. If the attack hits, it deals double damage; if the attack roll's result is also higher than 11 + the target's Swim modifier, the attack knocks the target off-balance until its next turn. Like with a charge, you can perform a partial version when limited to a single standard action (such as in the surprise round); in addition to moving half as far as normal for a partial charge, the attack doubles only the damage dice (as per Vital Strike) rather than the full damage roll.
