You move with uncommon grace that disorients enemies, causing foes that strike at you to overreach and stumble.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay25a7.html?ItemName=Agile%20Maneuvers">Agile Maneuvers</a>, <a href="featdisplay849b.html?ItemName=Azata%20Style">Azata Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: While using Azata Style, whenever an opponent misses you with an attack of opportunity provoked by your movement through its threatened squares, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature at the end of your turn as a swift action, provided you are still adjacent to the creature when you end your movement for the round. This trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check equal to any bonuses to AC you gain against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement (such as that granted by the Mobility feat).
