Your training under the Master of Swords has taught
you that a well-timed strike is worth waiting for and
that patience will serve you well in the long run.


Prerequisites: Int 13.

Benefit:  You can choose to ready an attack as a fullround
action instead of a standard action. When you do
so, you gain a +2 bonus on your attack roll when your
readied action triggers.


Normal:  Readying an attack is a standard action and
doesn't grant a bonus on your attack roll.
