This town needs cleaning up, and you're just the one to do it.


Prerequisites: You must have 5 ranks in Intimidate
and a personal motivation to clean up a particular town
(such as an old friend calling in a favor, or seeking a place
to settle down), or you must have the Bounty Hunter or
Champion of the People background.

Benefit:  Choose a particular settlement. When you're
in your chosen settlement, the DC of Intimidate checks
made against you increases by 10. You gain a +1 bonus
on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against
undesirable elements like criminals or ruffians in your
chosen settlement. This bonus increases to +2 for combat
maneuver checks.


Goal:  Defeat 10 more troublemakers in your chosen
settlement with a CR equal to your character level or
higher, and in the process eliminate a serious criminal
threat or otherwise clean up the streets.


Completion Benefit:  You gain the ability to designate
a new chosen settlement as often as you wish. You must
first live in a settlement for 1 week to make it your chosen
settlement. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative
checks and a +1 bonus on saving throws when in your
chosen settlement.
