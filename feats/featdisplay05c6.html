Your familiar can speak with animals other than those of its own kind.

Prerequisites: Must have a familiar.

Benefit:  Choose a category of creature: amphibians, birds, felines, invertebrates, reptiles, rodents, simians, or vermin. Your familiar can speak with creatures of that kind.

Special:  This feat can be taken multiple times, choosing a different category of creature each time. The first time you take this feat, if your familiar can't already speak with creatures of its kind, you must choose that category of creature. If your familiar later gains the ability to speak with creatures of its kind, you can choose to apply this feat's benefits to a different category of creature instead.
