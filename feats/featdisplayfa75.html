Your extensive training with fellow Diamond Regiment solders has bolstered you against fear.

Prerequisites: Con 13, Wisdom 13, character level 3rd, member of the Diamond Regiment.

Benefit: Any effect that would normally make you panicked instead makes you frightened. Any effect that would make you frightened instead makes you shaken. Any effect that would make you shaken has no effect on you. Note that you can still become increasingly frightened by multiple fear effects from different sources, but that each source is modified before it is applied to you. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on any saving throw versus fear effects.
