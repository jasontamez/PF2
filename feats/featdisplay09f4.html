You have learned to augment your hexes with the energy of your spells.

Prerequisites: Hex class feature.

Benefit:  You can augment the power of a hex by expending a spell slot or prepared spell of at least 1st level. Each additional time you use this ability in the same day, it requires a prepared spell or spell slot 1 level higher (a 2nd-level spell the second time, a 3rdlevel spell the third time, and so on). When you amplify a hex, you can choose one: increase its saving throw DC by 1, increase its range by 30 feet (if it already has at least a 30-foot range), or increase its duration by 1 round (if it already has a duration of at least 1 round).
