Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 166</a>
You can throw an enemy spell back at its caster.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 15 ranks, <a href="featdisplay9a47.html?ItemName=Improved%20Counterspell">Improved Counterspell .</a>

Benefit:  Whenever you successfully counter a spell, it returns back to its caster. This works exactly like the spell turning spell.
