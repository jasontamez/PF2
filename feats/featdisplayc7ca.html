Sorcerous Strike (Combat)

The power flowing through your veins also flows through your unarmed strike.

Prerequisites: Sorcerer bloodline class feature, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit:  When you gain this feat, you choose one bloodline power that you can use to affect a single opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can spend a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen bloodline power to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying bloodline power.

After hitting with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 stamina points to apply the effects of your chosen bloodline power as a free action instead of a swift action.
