You blend arms and martial arts, using weapons with the same ease as unarmed strikes.

Prerequisites: Weapon Focus with the chosen melee weapon; base attack bonus +1 or monk level 1st.

Benefit:  Choose one weapon from the monk fighter weapon group. While using this style and wielding the chosen weapon, you can apply the effects of feats that have Improved Unarmed Strike as a prerequisite, as well as effects that augment an unarmed strike, as if attacks with the weapon were unarmed attacks.

Special:  A 5th-level monk or character with the weapon training (monk) class feature can use Ascetic Style with any monk weapon, in addition to the chosen melee weapon.
