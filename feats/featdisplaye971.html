You have trained in the art of blocking breath weapons.

Prerequisites: Channel energy class feature, worshiper of Apsu.

Benefit:  When you are within an area effect that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you can expend one use of your channel energy ability as an immediate action to shield yourself and all allies within 30 feet. You and allies within your shield only take half damage if they fail their save against the effect, and those who make a successful save take no damage from the effect.
