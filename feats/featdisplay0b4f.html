You can focus the Abyss's power to sow discord among those who take damage from your channeled energy.

Prerequisites: Channel energy 8d6, worshiper of a demon lord.

Benefit:  Once per day when you channel negative energy to harm living creatures, in addition to dealing damage you can choose to affect those who fail their Will save against your channel with a song of discord (caster level equal to your effective cleric level).
