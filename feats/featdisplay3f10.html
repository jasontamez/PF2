Confounding Tumble Deed - Feats







Confounding Tumble Deed (Panache)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 143</a>
You can befuddle a foe by striking a blow after tumbling.

Prerequisites: Amateur Swashbuckler feat or panache class feature, <a href="featdisplay9c7a.html?ItemName=Canny%20Tumble">Canny Tumble</a>, Acrobatics 7 ranks.

Benefit:  When you use Acrobatics to move through an opponent's threatened area or space without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent and then hit that foe with a melee attack in the same round, as a free action you can spend 1 panache point to deny that foe its Dexterity bonus to its armor class until the end of your next turn.
