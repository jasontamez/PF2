Your melee strike leaves your target vulnerable to a merciless finishing shot.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay14f2.html?ItemName=Stock-Striker%20Style">Stock-Striker Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay00cd.html?ItemName=Stock-Striker%20Sweep">Stock-Striker Sweep</a>, base attack bonus +9, pistol-whip gunslinger deed.

Benefit: After you knock a target prone with the pistol-whip deed while using Stock-Striker Style, you can fire one barrel of a loaded firearm you're wielding at the target as a move action; if your firearm has the scatter weapon quality, you can instead make a scattering shot so long as you include the target in the area of effect. For this attack, you take no attack penalty for making a ranged attack against a prone target, and the critical multiplier of your weapon increases by 1 (to a maximum of ??5).
