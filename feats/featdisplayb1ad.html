Reward of the Faithful

Your intense belief in your deity allows you to benefit more from divine magic he or she provides.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 1 rank, alignment must match that of your worshiped deity.

Benefit: Whenever you are the only target of a divine spell cast by a follower of your chosen deity other than you, the spell's caster level is treated as though it were 2 higher than it actually is. Additionally, whenever you regain hit points as a result of a worshiper of your deity other than you channeling energy or casting a cure spell, you regain 1 additional hit point per die rolled for the healing gained.
