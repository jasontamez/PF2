Your stubborn mind is not easy to sway.

Benefit: When you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect with a duration of 1 round or longer (such as confusion), you can choose to be dazzled for the first round of the duration instead of suffering the usual effect. On subsequent rounds, the effect functions normally. If an effect, immunity, or other ability prevents you from being dazzled, this feat has no effect.
