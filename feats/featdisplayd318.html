You use the urban environment to your advantage, thrashing and bashing your foe and driving it back.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplay34d3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +4 or monk level 3rd.

Benefit: While using this style, once per round as a swift action when you hit a target with an unarmed strike, you can deal an extra 1d6 points of damage and attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that target.

Special: You can enter the style stance for street style only while in urban terrain, and the stance ends immediately if you cease to be in urban terrain.
