Artifact Hunter - Feats







Artifact Hunter (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Quests-Campaigns">Quests and Campaigns pg. 7</a>
You seek an artifact-either a specific one or merely any
item of legendary prowess-with dogged tenacity.

Prerequisites: You must have come within sight of a
legendary artifact at some point in your past.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device
checks when emulating a class feature, ability score, race,
or alignment. If you have 10 or more ranks in Use Magic
Device, this bonus increases to +4. In addition, once per
day, instead of attempting a Use Magic Device check
normally, you can choose to determine the result as if you
had rolled a 15. If you have 10 or more ranks in Use Magic
Device, you can use this ability twice per day.

Goal: Claim ownership of an artifact.

Completion Benefit: You learn how to coax the most
out of your magic items. Three times per day when you
activate a use-activated or command word magic item,
you can increase the item's effective caster level by +2 as a
free action. You can use this ability once per round.


Suggested Traits: Dangerously Curious, Fortunate, Secret-Keeper.
