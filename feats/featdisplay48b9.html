Your animal companion can terrify as well as fight.

Prerequisites: Handle Animal 4 ranks, Intimidate 4 ranks, animal companion or mount class feature.

Benefit: Your animal companion or mount gains Intimidate as a class skill. It can attempt to demoralize an opponent using the Intimidate skill as a move action on the same round that it damages an opponent with a natural attack.

Normal: Animal companions and mounts with an Intelligence score of 2 or less must select feats from a limited list.

Special: Your animal companion can select the Dazzling Display and Shatter Defenses feats if it meets the prerequisites. This feat does not allow your animal companion to use Intimidate to make a target friendly or gain their assistance.
