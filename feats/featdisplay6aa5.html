You have spent significant time in the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, and your proximity to so many firearms has given you a familiarity with their delicate handling.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +3, proficiency with at least one firearm.

Benefit:  Once per day as an immediate action, you can reroll an attack roll with a firearm that would have resulted in a misfire. You must take the results of the new roll, even if it results in a misfire as well.
