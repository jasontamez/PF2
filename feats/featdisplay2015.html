Your mercy has incredible recuperative properties.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, lay on hands class feature, mercy class feature.

Benefit:  When you use your lay on hands ability and the target of that ability does not have any conditions your mercies can remove, it instead heals an additional +1d6 points of damage.
