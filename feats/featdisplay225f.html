Your mastery of ranged weapons enables you to use them to perform deeds that you would normally need a firearm to accomplish.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6, weapon training class feature with a ranged weapon.

Benefit:  You can perform the utility shot gunslinger deed with an appropriate ranged weapon with which you are proficient. If you have both the utility shot deed and this feat, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls made as part of a utility shot and you can use the utility shot deed while you have no grit points.

Special:  A gunslinger can ignore the weapon training class feature prerequisite of Marksman's Deed.
