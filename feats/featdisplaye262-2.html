Once you were just another helpless victim, but now even the deepest pits of Hell ring with the lamentations of your adversaries.

Prerequisites: Face 10 different devils in combat and take damage or suffer some other sort of injury from five or more attacks made by each one without falling unconscious, fleeing, or otherwise becoming unable to strike back at them.

Benefit: Your attacks count as good-aligned for the purposes of bypassing the damage reduction of devils.
