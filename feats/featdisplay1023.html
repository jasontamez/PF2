Your study of the nature and hazards of a diverse array of planes has prepared you for their dangers.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, Survival 3 ranks.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks on planes other than the Material Plane and a +2 bonus on saving throws against hazards encountered in such environments. If you have 10 or more ranks in Survival, the bonus on Survival checks increases to +4. This bonus does not stack with the bonus granted by the Self-Sufficient feat.
