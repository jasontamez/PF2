Whether as predator or prey, you have learned to move like the arctic wind when survival is at stake.

Prerequisites: Acrobatics 5 ranks.

Benefit: While charging, running, or withdrawing, you gain a foot enhancement bonus to your base speed. This bonus also applies to your speed when calculating overland movement in any plains terrain. You lose the benefits of this feat while you are wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.
