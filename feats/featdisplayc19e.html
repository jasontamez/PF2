Like a wyvern on the wing, you command a fluid style that enables you to make attacks while moving.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (whip)</a>, <a href="featdisplay4651.html?ItemName=Wyvern%20Fury%20Style">Wyvern Fury Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay266f.html?ItemName=Wyvern%20Sting">Wyvern Sting</a>, Acrobatics 10 ranks, brawler's flurry class feature or flurry of blows class feature.

Benefit: While using the Wyvern Style feat, if you use flurry of blows or brawler's flurry and take a 5-foot step, you can take an additional 5-foot step. You can take this extra 5-foot step only between two attacks in your flurry, but you can take both your 5-foot steps consecutively without making an attack between them.
