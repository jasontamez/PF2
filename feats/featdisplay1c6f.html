Run

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 132</a>
You are swift of foot.

Benefit: When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Acrobatics skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Acrobatics check. While running, you retain your Dexterity bonus to your Armor Class.

Normal: You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.

Mythic Run

You run with preternatural speed and endurance.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1c6f.html?ItemName=Run">Run.</a>

Benefit:  When running, you move seven times your normal speed if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load, or six times your speed if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load. When making a jump after a running start, you gain an additional bonus equal to your tier + 4 on your Acrobatics check.

You can run normally for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score plus your tier, but after that you must succeed at Constitution checks to continue running.
