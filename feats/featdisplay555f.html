You have embraced the Roaring Falls method of Aldori swordplay, known for its elegant, sweeping strikes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay3e34.html?ItemName=Aldori%20Dueling%20Disciple">Aldori Dueling Disciple</a>, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, base attack bonus +5.

Benefit: When you use an Aldori dueling sword to deal damage to a shaken, frightened, or panicked foe, you can add your Dexterity bonus to damage rolls instead of your Strength bonus. If you can already add your Dexterity bonus to damage rolls, you instead gain a +1 competence bonus on damage rolls made with an Aldori dueling sword. When you attempt a dueling parry during a duel, the penalty on your attack roll to parry is reduced from -5 to -3. To gain these benefits, you must be wielding only an Aldori dueling sword (not using a shield, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).

When you hit a foe with a melee attack made using an Aldori dueling sword, you can spend 4 stamina points to treat that foe as being shaken for the purpose of gaining a bonus from Duelist of the Roaring Falls until the start of your next turn.
