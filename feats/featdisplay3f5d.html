Deadly Finish (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 94</a>
Your attacks don't just fell your opponents-they kill them outright.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  When you hit with a melee attack and reduce your opponent to -1 or fewer hit points, you can force that opponent to succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15 + the damage your attack dealt) or die.
