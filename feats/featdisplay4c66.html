Gorgon's Fist - Feats







Gorgon's Fist (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 124</a>
With one well-placed blow, you leave your target reeling.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay3693.html?ItemName=Scorpion%20Style">Scorpion Style</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: As a standard action, make a single unarmed melee attack against a foe whose speed is reduced (such as from Scorpion Style). If the attack hits, you deal damage normally and the target is staggered until the end of your next turn unless it makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier). This feat has no effect on targets that are staggered.

You can spend 5 stamina points to make a Gorgon's Fist attack as one of the individual attacks made during a full attack.

Mythic Gorgon's Fist

Your strikes debilitate and disorient your foes.

Prerequisites: Gorgon's Fist.

Benefit:  When you hit a creature while using Gorgon's Fist, if the target fails its Fortitude saving throw, it is dazed for 1 round instead of staggered. You can expend one use of mythic power when you hit with a Gorgon's Fist attack, but before the saving throw is attempted, to increase its DC by half your tier.
