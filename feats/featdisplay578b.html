You have mastered the ancient Shoanti Thunder and Fang fighting style, allowing you to fight with increased effectiveness when wielding an earth breaker and klar.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (earth breaker)</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (klar)</a>

Benefit:  You can use an earth breaker as though it were a one-handed weapon. When using an earth breaker in one hand and a klar in your off hand, you retain the shield bonus your klar grants to your Armor Class even when you use it to attack. Treat your klar as a light weapon for the purposes of determining your two-weapon fighting penalty.

Normal:  An earth breaker is a two-handed weapon, preventing the use of a klar in one hand without imposing penalties for using the earth breaker one-handed. A klar can be used either as a one-handed weapon or a shield; it does not grant a bonus to AC during rounds in which it is used as a weapon.

Special:  This is a combat feat, and may be selected with class features that grant bonus combat feats.
