You use your tower shield to defend yourself or an ally at a moment's notice.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplaybbb4.html?ItemName=Mobile%20Bulwark%20Style">Mobile Bulwark Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplayb88d.html?ItemName=Tower%20Shield%20Proficiency">Tower Shield Proficiency</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: While using a tower shield, you add half of the shield's bonus to AC (including its enhancement bonus) to your touch AC and take only a -1 penalty on attack rolls because of the shield's encumbrance. While using Mobile Bulwark Style, whenever you would use a tower shield to gain total cover, you also grant any adjacent ally total cover against attacks passing through the selected edge of your space.
