With a single curse, you make your rival less fearsome in combat.

Prerequisites: Int 13, base attack bonus +6, Use Magic Device 1 rank.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can curse the accuracy of an enemy you have dealt damage to in the last minute. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or it automatically fails to confirm all critical threats. This effect lasts for 1 round.

Special: If a shaman or witch uses this blood hex, the target is unable to deal precision damage or sneak attack damage for the hex's duration.
