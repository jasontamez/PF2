As a student trained in the Impossible Techniques of Jalmeray, you can rend wood, burst brick, or even shatter steel with the perfect focus and application of your ki.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +6, must be lawful.

Benefit: You gain a pool of ki points equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). As a swift action, you may focus your ki into strikes that can overcome the hardness of any substance. Each unarmed strike attack you make while in this focus expends 1 ki from your pool, whether or not it hit. You lose your focus automatically when you run out of ki, when the encounter ends, if you are reduced to fewer than 0 hit points or killed, or as a free action any time you wish.

While focused in this way, your unarmed strikes are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction or bypassing hardness.

Special: You may gain this feat multiple times. For each additional time you gain the feat you add 1 to your ki pool and your unarmed strikes gain an additional property for overcoming damage reduction, in the following order: adamantine, cold iron, silver, magic, lawful, epic. If your unarmed strikes already count as one or more of those properties (from any source), they gain the next property in line.

A monk trained at one of the Houses of Perfection may select Secret of Steel-Shattering Spirit as his 6th-level monk bonus feat.
