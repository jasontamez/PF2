Your knowledge of the undead makes you especially effective when fighting them.

Prerequisites: Favored enemy (undead) class feature.

Benefit: You gain a bonus equal to half your favored enemy (undead) bonus on saving throws against ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, and negative energy effects. Once per day, when an undead creature's natural attack against you deals ability damage, deals ability drain, or bestows 1 or more negative levels, you can negate the damage, drain, or negative levels as an immediate action.
