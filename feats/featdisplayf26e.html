You have died and returned so often that even Pharasma now deems it part of your fate.

Prerequisites: Risen Guard 20 TPA.

Benefit: Once per day, you may reroll a save or skill check if failure has a chance of killing you (whether from hit point damage, ability damage, or some instant effect). You must decide to use this ability before the results are revealed. You must take the second roll, even if it is worse.
