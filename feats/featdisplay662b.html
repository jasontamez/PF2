You can use a dorn-dergar with only one hand.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>, base attack bonus +4, proficiency with the dwarven dorn-dergar.

Benefit: You can use a dorn-dergar as a one-handed weapon. When using it one-handed, changing whether it's a normal or reach weapon is a full-round action. If you have the Darting Viper feat, changing its reach is a move action.

Normal: A dorn-dergar requires two hands to wield.
