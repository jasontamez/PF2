You are master of your own gravity in planar realms where gravity is subjective.

Prerequisites: Wis 13.

Benefit: You automatically succeed at Wisdom checks to set a new direction of gravity. When you set a new direction of gravity, you can reduce your falling speed by up to twothirds (to a minimum of 50 feet on the first round and 100 feet per round thereafter) or increase it to a maximum of twice normal (300 feet on the first round and 600 feet per round thereafter). These effects only apply on planes with subjective directional gravity.
