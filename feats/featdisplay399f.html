You have refined your ability to leap through the shadows.

Prerequisites: Shadow jump shadowdancer class feature.

Benefit:  When you travel between shadows using the shadow jump ability, the minimum increment that you can jump is 5 feet, allowing you to split your shadow jumps into 5-foot increments instead of 10-foot increments. In addition, your shadow jump ability counts as the ability to cast dimension door for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Dimensional Agility feat as well as any feat that lists that feat as a prerequisite, and your shadow jump benefits from such feats as if you were casting dimension door.

Normal:  Each shadow jump, no matter how small, counts as a 10-foot increment.
