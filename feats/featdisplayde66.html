Your heritage is strange or difficult to trace, and people fear your otherworldly powers.

Prerequisites: Gillman.

Benefit:  As a so-called "Low Azlanti," you have abilities supposedly tied to mysterious ancestors who still watch over you and your ilk. Your divination spells and spell-like abilities manifest at 1 caster level higher. In addition, once per day while fully immersed in water, you can cast augury as a spell-like ability.
