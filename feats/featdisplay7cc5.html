Self-preservation is irrelevant in the face of your fury.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: While using this style, when you use the charge action, the bonus on your attack roll increases by 1 and you deal 2 additional points of damage with melee attacks made as part of the charge.

Special: If you have the rage or bloodrage class feature, you can enter Demonic Style's stance as part of the free action to enter a rage. If you do, the style stance ends when your rage ends.
