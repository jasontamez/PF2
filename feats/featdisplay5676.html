The power of your discovered bloodline continues to grow.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, <a href="featdisplayad7c.html?ItemName=Eldritch%20Heritage">Eldritch Heritage</a>, character level 11th.

Benefit:  You gain either the 3rd-level or the 9th-level power (your choice) of the bloodline you selected with the Eldritch Heritage feat. For purposes of using that power, treat your sorcerer level as equal to your character level - 2, even if you have levels in sorcerer. You do not gain any of the other bloodline abilities.

Special:  You may select this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you select the feat, it applies to a different bloodline power for that bloodline available at sorcerer level 3 or 9.
