Stick-Fighting Counter - Feats







Stick-Fighting Counter (Combat)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 12</a>
Using stick-fighting techniques both defensively and offensively, you can turn your parries into counterattacks.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay02cf.html?ItemName=Stick-Fighting%20Style">Stick-Fighting Style</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: While you are fighting defensively, as a free action you can select an opponent you have attacked on that turn and prepare yourself to counter one of its attacks. Once per round, when that opponent attempts a melee attack against you and the attack misses, the attacker provokes an attack of opportunity from you, provided that it is within your threatened area. You must use a club, quarterstaff, dan bong, sap, or tonfa to perform the attack of opportunity.
