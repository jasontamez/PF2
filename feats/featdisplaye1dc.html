The shield wall was the heart of the Gray Maidens' military strategy; combined with their precise tactical coordination, Gray Maiden lines were nearly unbreakable. Maidens behind the line would then strike with polearms or longbows, picking off targets with ease.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplayf6c7.html?ItemName=Shield%20Wall">Shield Wall</a>, <a href="featdisplay66ed.html?ItemName=Sisterhood%20Style">Sisterhood Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (longsword)</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: While using Sisterhood Style, you and adjacent allies gain an additional +1 bonus to the shield bonus granted by Shield Wall, and each of you adds your shield bonus to AC (not counting enhancement bonuses) to your CMD against bull rush combat maneuvers. In addition, you and adjacent allies do not provide soft cover against allies' attacks.
