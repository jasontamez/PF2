Eerie Sense

You have a knack for sniffing out undead.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast detect undead or detect evil as a spell or spell-like ability, worshiper of Pharasma.

Benefit:  At the beginning of your turn each round, if you are within 60 feet of an undead creature or a haunt, you get a chill down your spine and instinctively sense that something eerie is very near. This sense does not alert you to the direction of the undead or haunt. Anything that can block detect undead can likewise block this sense.
