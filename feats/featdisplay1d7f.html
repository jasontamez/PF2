Step Up - Feats







Step Up (Combat)

You can close the distance when a foe tries to move away.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: Whenever an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may also make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to the foe that triggered this ability. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, on the turn after you use this feat, you can still take a 5-foot step, and you don't reduce your speed if you take an action to move due to this feat.
