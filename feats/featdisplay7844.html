Command Undead - Feats







Command Undead

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 120</a>
Using foul powers of necromancy, you can command undead creatures, making them into your servants.

Prerequisites: Channel negative energy class feature.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can use one of your uses of channel negative energy to enslave undead within 30 feet. Undead receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their saves fall under your control, obeying your commands to the best of their ability, as if under the effects of control undead. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each day to resist your command. You can control any number of undead, so long as their total Hit Dice do not exceed your cleric level. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures). If an undead creature is under the control of another creature, you must make an opposed Charisma check whenever your orders conflict.

Mythic Command Undead

Your control of the undead is nearly absolute.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7844.html?ItemName=Command%20Undead">Command Undead.</a>

Benefit:  When you command undead, the DC of the Will save increases by half your tier, and intelligent undead get no additional saves beyond their first to resist your commands. Any attempts by non-mythic creatures to control undead you command automatically fail, and you gain a +4 bonus on Charisma checks to prevent mythic creatures from stealing control of your undead.
