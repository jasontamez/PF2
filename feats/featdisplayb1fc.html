You become more difficult to move or pass, an elusive peak your enemies cannot surmount.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay1952.html?ItemName=Indomitable%20Mountain%20Style">Indomitable Mountain Style</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: Whenever an opponent succeeds at a combat maneuver against you or at an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity when moving through a square you threaten, you immediately gain a +2 morale bonus to your CMD against the next combat maneuver against you or to the DC of the next Acrobatics check to avoid an attack of opportunity when moving through a square you threaten. This bonus stacks until either attempt fails against you.
