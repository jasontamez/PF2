You can fire bullets of arcane energy when your ammunition runs low.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a>, ability to cast arcane spells, proficient with firearms.

Benefit: While your gun is imbued with power from the <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a> feat, you can fire force bullets instead of regular ammunition. A force bullet deals 1d4 points of force damage for every five caster levels you have. Force bullets do not use black powder or ammunition and count as magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction.
