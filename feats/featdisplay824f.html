Your painful stare makes your enemies easier to grab and constrict.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.

Benefit: When you trigger your painful stare to add damage to an attack with grab, the target takes a -4 penalty to its CMD against the grab's grapple combat maneuver attempt.
