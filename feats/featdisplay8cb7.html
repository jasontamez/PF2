Your jinxes hinder beneficial spells.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 5 ranks, Halfling Jinx trait.

Benefit: Beneficial variable effects on a jinxed target (such as aid, cure spells, false life, the variable ability damage cured by lesser restoration, and so on) always result in the minimum possible amount for the effect. For example, a 5th-level cleric casting cure serious wounds on the target only heals 8 hit points (the minimum for 3d8+5).
