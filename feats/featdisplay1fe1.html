With no other allies to enjoy your performance, you improvise to make it more inspiring for yourself.

Prerequisites: Perform (any) 3 ranks, bardic performance or raging song class feature.

Benefit: Whenever you are the only creature affected by a bardic performance or raging song that normally affects all allies within a range, any bonuses granted by your bardic performance or raging song are calculated as though your class level were 4 higher. This feat does not allow you to activate a bardic performance or raging song if your actual class level is not high enough to use that performance.
