Your skill with lighter weapons allows you to wield one alongside your net.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net)</a>, <a href="featdisplay4c17.html?ItemName=Net%20Adept">Net Adept</a>, <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting.</a>

Benefit:  You can treat a net as a one-handed ranged weapon, allowing you to wield a light or one-handed melee weapon and still make ranged attacks with your net. When you use your light or one-handed melee weapon to attack an entangled opponent, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls and on attack rolls to confirm a critical hit.

Normal:  A net is a two-handed ranged weapon.
