When using this feat, once per round when you hit a creature with a follow-up Cleave attack, you can spend 5 stamina points to take a second 5-foot step as a free action. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional Cleave attacks as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.
