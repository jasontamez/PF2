Through researching lengthy, ancient, arcane scripts salvaged from Thassilonian ruins, you have discovered a more efficient method of recording spells. As with the Cypher Magic feat, Cypher Script was originally developed by the Cyphermages of Riddleport, but recently has been spreading through the Inner Sea region.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank, Linguistics 1 rank, Spellcraft 1 rank, spellbook class feature.

Benefit: Any spell you scribe in your spellbook costs half as much as normal and takes up only half the room it normally would (round all fractions up). It takes you only 10 minutes per spell level to scribe a spell into your spellbook (5 minutes for cantrips).
