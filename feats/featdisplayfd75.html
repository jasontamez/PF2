The innate planar energies of your allies empower your magical abilities, allowing you to make your spell-like abilities more difficult to resist.

Prerequisites: Any racial spell-like ability, outsider.

Benefit:  Whenever you're adjacent to an outsider ally who also has this feat, the DC of any racial spell-like abilities you use increases by 2 if your ally has the same racial spell-like ability. The proximity of multiple allies can't increase the DC further.
