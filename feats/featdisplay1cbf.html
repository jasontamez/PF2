Your mystic connection with the wilderness enhances your ability to react to threats.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayefc5.html?ItemName=Attuned%20to%20the%20Wild">Attuned to the Wild</a>, elf.

Benefit:  When you are in a terrain type you have selected the Attuned to the Wild feat for, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. If you are in an area that qualifies as more than one kind of terrain, these bonuses do not stack; you receive the bonus for only one of the terrain types.
