True Love (Story)

You found love, only to have it denied by the cruelty of fate.


Prerequisites: You must have found love with a person
you can't be with, have a current lover, or have the
Current Lover, For Love, or The Lover background.
Possible complications include distance, your love being
with another, your feelings being unrequited, or your
relationship being forbidden.

Benefit:  You add 1 to the save DC and caster level of your
spells and spell-like abilities with the emotion descriptor.
In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks.
If you have 10 or more ranks in Sense Motive, this bonus
increases to +4.


Goal:  Find a way to be with your true love (even if you
can't formally wed).


Completion Benefit:  The inspiration of knowing your
love waits for your return gives you a +2 bonus on attack
rolls, saving throws, and skill checks whenever you are
below a quarter of your total hit points (not counting any
temporary hit points). You lose this completion benefit if
your relationship with your true love comes to an end for
any reason, including death.


Special:  At the GM's discretion, you can find true love
with a person other than the one you designated when you
chose this feat. In this case, the love you initially chose
was wrong for you, but this became obvious only when
you found the one truly meant for you.
