Your training with the Pathfinder Society (or its rivals) has taught you proper caution and wariness when deciphering the ancient scrolls and inscriptions of fallen civilizations.

Prerequisites: Linguistics 3 ranks, Spellcraft 3 ranks.

Benefit:  You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against written magical effects, including explosive runes, glyph of warding, illusory script, symbol of death, and similar magic, as well as against any form of curse, madness, possession, or similar effect-magical or not-that might occur from reading a book, inscription, scroll, or any other form of writing.
