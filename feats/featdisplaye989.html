You can call upon the sprits of ancient heroes to convey the blessings of the gods in battle.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 5 ranks, ability to turn undead, at least one favored enemy.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can expend a use of your turn undead ability to imbue a weapon you touch with the bane property against your favored enemy (choose one if you have more than one favored enemy) until the beginning of your next turn. The affected weapon may be used by you or by someone else.
