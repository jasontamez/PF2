You strongly defend your allies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay4ebc.html?ItemName=Bodyguard">Bodyguard</a>, <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="featdisplay2e0b.html?ItemName=Vanguard%20Style">Vanguard Style</a>, proficiency with light or heavy shields.

Benefit: While using Vanguard Style, when an adjacent ally is attacked or required to make a Reflex saving throw, you can expend a use of an attack of opportunity to use both Bodyguard and Vanguard Style to protect that ally. You can also lose your shield bonus to AC to grant your ally a shield bonus to AC of the same value for as long as that ally gains a bonus to Reflex saves from Vanguard Style.
