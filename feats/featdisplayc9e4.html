You follow a powerful blow from your weapon with an opportunistic bash from your shield.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1341.html?ItemName=Improved%20Shield%20Bash">Improved Shield Bash</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a21.html?ItemName=Shield%20Master">Shield Master</a>, <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee weapon, you can make a shield bash attack against the same target using the same bonus as a free action.

When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 5 stamina points to make a shield bash attack against the target anyway. You still can't make the attack if the target is immune to critical hits.
