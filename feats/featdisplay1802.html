You can repeatedly close the distance when foes try to move away, without impeding your normal movement.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay1d7f.html?ItemName=Step%20Up">Step Up.</a>

Benefit:  When using the Step Up feat to follow an adjacent foe, you may move up to 10 feet. You may still take a 5-foot step during your next turn, and any movement you make using this feat does not subtract any distance from your movement during your next turn.

Normal:  You can only take a 5-foot step to follow an opponent using Step Up.
