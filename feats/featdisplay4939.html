You rebound more quickly than normal when you draw upon your inner reserve to repair your wounds.

Prerequisites: Con 13, <a href="featdisplay57ef.html?ItemName=Combat%20Vigor">Combat Vigor</a>, <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance</a>, character level 3rd.

Benefit: Your vigor pool gains 1 vigor point. The fatigued condition that you gain from spending vigor points (as described by the Combat Vigor feat on page 14) lasts for 3 rounds instead of 1 minute. In addition, when you take this feat, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion.
