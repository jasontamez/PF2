Feats









Achievement Feats



Description  Source <a href="http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/35E/v5748btpy8737">Legacy of Fire Player's Guide pg. 28</a>
Inspired by a variety of video games and board games that utilize similar conventions, achievement feats require the cooperation of the player and the GM to make the transition into the world of pen-and-paper RPGs. Players who seek to qualify for an achievement feat should tell their GM early so he can begin noting the PC's progress toward the feat's requirement, or be aware that the player is tracking his character's accomplishments with this goal in mind. Although they require more bookkeeping to attain than typical feats, these feats are custom-designed to reward players of Legacy of Fire and should help PCs feel like they've accomplished something pertinent to the campaign's goals. GMs who don't think achievement feats are for their game can ignore this section with no detriment to their campaign, but for those who do test them out, we-d love to hear your stories and playtest experiences on our messageboards at <a href="http://www.paizo.com/traits">pazio.com/traits</a>.
