Weapon Mastery Feats



Description  Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdy?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Weapon-Masters-Handbook">Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 20</a>
Although most combat techniques are general enough to be categorized as combat feats, some require such a high level of martial skill that they are instead categorized as weapon mastery feats. Weapon mastery feats count as combat feats for all purposes, including which classes can select them as bonus feats, and you gain the benefits of a weapon mastery feat only while wielding a weapon that belongs to a fighter weapon group that you have selected with the fighter weapon training class feature (referred to hereafter as an "appropriate weapon"), and any effect of these feats related to attacks applies only to attacks from such weapons unless the feat specifies otherwise. Characters who lack the weapon training class feature can access weapon mastery feats by taking the Martial Focus feat below.
