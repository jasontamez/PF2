Your deity lays curses upon those who wrong you.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast at least one spell or spell-like ability with the curse descriptor, worshiper of Calistria.

Benefit:  Whenever you are rendered helpless or a creature kills you, you can cast a single spell or spell-like ability with the curse descriptor as an immediate action before you become helpless or are killed. The curse must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and must target the creature who rendered you helpless or who killed you. If the curse has a range of touch and the attacker is not within your reach, you can deliver it as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet.
