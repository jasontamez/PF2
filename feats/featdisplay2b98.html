Spell Bane

While your bane weapon is active, creatures that your bane affects find it more difficult to resist your spells.

Prerequisites: Bane class feature.

Benefit:  While your bane class feature is affecting a creature type, the saving throw's DCs for your spells increase by +2 for creatures of that type.
