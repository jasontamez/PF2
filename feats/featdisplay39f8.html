You can cast many spells without needing to utilize minor material components.

Benefit: You can cast any spell with a material component costing 1 gp or less without needing that component. The casting of the spell still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 1 gp, you must have the material component on hand to cast the spell, as normal.

Benefit:  You can cast any spell with a material component costing 10 gp per tier or less without providing that component. If you expend one use of mythic power while casting a spell that requires a material component costing 50 gp per tier or less, you can cast it without providing that component. Expending two uses of mythic power instead allows you to cast a spell that requires a material component costing 100 gp per tier or less without providing that component.
