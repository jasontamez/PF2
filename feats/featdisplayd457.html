Your words soothe the dead and undead alike, and can even affect haunts.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast 3rd-level spells.

Benefit: You gain Necril as a bonus language, and gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against undead creatures or when you speak Necril. Add <a href="spelldisplay0970.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20dead">speak with dead</a> to your list of spells known. As soon as you gain the ability to cast 4th-level spells, add <a href="spelldisplaydc7a.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20haunt">speak with haunt</a> to your list of spells known. Whenever you cast speak with dead or speak with haunt, treat your alignment as identical to that of the dead creature or haunt with which you are speaking, and increase the effective caster level of the spell by 2.
