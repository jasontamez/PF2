Proxy Summoning

Creatures you summon can act as proxies to deliver your spells to foes.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast conjuration (summoning) spells or a conjuration (summoning) spell-like ability, caster level 5th.

Benefit:  Whenever you cast a touch spell while adjacent to a creature you summoned (including an eidolon), you can have the summoned creature carry the spell's charge. Once the spell is cast, you and any creature you summon gain the share spells ability (Core Rulebook 52). This feat doesn't qualify you for feats or other rules options that require you to have an animal companion, familiar, or similar allied creature with the share spells ability.
