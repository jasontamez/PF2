Monster Feats



Description  Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures">Horror Adventures pg. 78</a>
Monster feats were introduced in Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, though without a separate tag (all feats in Bestiary are monster feats except <a href="featdisplay2071.html?ItemName=Craft%20Construct">Craft Construct</a>). Most of these feats apply specifically to monsters and might grant abilities that could be disruptive in the hands of PCs, although with the GM's permission PCs can take one of these feats if they meet the prerequisites.

Some monster feats allow a creature to apply metamagic feat-like effects to its spell-like abilities. You can select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 the monster's caster level (round down) - 1 or 2, depending on the ability. Table 3-1: Metamagic Spell-Like Abilities summarizes these feats and what spell-like abilities they can affect by caster level.
