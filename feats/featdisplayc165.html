Benefit:  Choose one weapon from the axes, hammers, or flails fighter weapon group. While using this style, when you succeed at a sunder combat maneuver check against a suit of armor worn by an opponent, you can immediately attempt a bull rush or trip combat maneuver against that target with the same combat maneuver bonus. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Special:  A character with the weapon training (axes, hammers, or flails) class feature can use Smashing Style with any axe, flail, or hammer, respectively, in addition to the chosen weapon.
