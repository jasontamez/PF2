Your hammer strikes cause traumatic injuries.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay2c99.html?ItemName=Improved%20Sunder">Improved Sunder</a>, <a href="featdisplaya480.html?ItemName=Smashing%20Crush">Smashing Crush</a>, <a href="featdisplayc165.html?ItemName=Smashing%20Style">Smashing Style</a>, Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  While using Smashing Style, each time you damage a suit of armor with a sunder combat maneuver, you reduce its armor bonus to its Armor Class by 1 and increase its armor check penalty by 1. Armor cannot have its armor bonus to AC reduced to less than 50% of its normal bonus or its armor check penalty more than doubled. These reductions and increases both end when the damage dealt by the sunder is repaired.
