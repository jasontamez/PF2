You are so steadfast in the principles of your alignment, even magic has difficult swaying you.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, <a href="featdisplay4954.html?ItemName=Unimpeachable%20Honor">Unimpeachable Honor</a>, lawful alignment.

Benefit: Whenever you are under the effect of a charm or compulsion effect cast by or coming from a source with a chaotic alignment or an alignment on the good and evil axis opposite of your alignment (evil if you are good, and good if you are evil) you gain a +2 on any saving throw or opposed Charisma check to break free from the effect. This bonus stacks with itself and with the bonus granted by Unimpeachable Honor.
