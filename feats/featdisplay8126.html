You and your teammates can deliver touch spells through each other's familiars.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc2d2.html?ItemName=Group%20Shared%20Spells">Group Shared Spells</a>, must have a familiar with the share spells and deliver touch spells abilities.

Benefit:  You and any allies with this feat can cast spells through one another's familiars as though each ally had the share spells ability with each other familiar. This feat otherwise functions as the share spells ability.
