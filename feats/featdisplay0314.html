Crippling Critical - Feats







Crippling Critical (Combat, Critical)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 157</a>
You are able to maim a target and hinder its movement.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a>, base attack bonus +13.

Benefit:  Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack must make a DC 10 Fly check to remain airborne, and has its maneuverability reduced by one step.

Special:  You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.

When you confirm a critical hit and attempt to cripple an opponent with this feat, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to increase the DC of this feat's saving throw by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
