Furious Focus (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 161</a>
Even in the midst of fierce and furious blows, you can find focus in the carnage and your seemingly wild blows strike home.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  When you are wielding a two-handed weapon or a one-handed weapon with two hands, and using the Power Attack feat, you do not suffer Power Attack's penalty on melee attack rolls on the first attack you make each turn. You still suffer the penalty on any additional attacks, including attacks of opportunity.

When using the Power Attack feat and wielding a two-handed melee weapon or a onehanded melee weapon with two hands, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, each successful attack you make against a target reduces your Power Attack penalty against that target by 1 (to a minimum of 0) until the beginning of your next turn.

Mythic Furious Focus

Your attacks create a rhythmic barrage that doesn't sacrifice precision for force.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8fa9.html?ItemName=Furious%20Focus">Furious Focus.</a>

Benefit:  When you are using Furious Focus, you don't take Power Attack's penalty on attack rolls that are made as attacks of opportunity. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate Power Attack's penalty on all melee attacks you make for 1 round while using this feat.
