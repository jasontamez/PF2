You dodge ranged attacks with greater proficiency than most.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms)</a>, gunslinger level 3rd, gunslinger's dodge deed.

Benefit: When you use the gunslinger's dodge deed to move, the movement granted by that deed does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you gain a +4 dodge bonus to your Armor Class.
