Many familiars are able to turn into other animals, but a few familiars have greater talents, and can transform into humanoid bodies of their own.

Prerequisites: Familiar class feature, caster level 9th, your familiar must have the <a href="umrd354.html?ItemName=Change%20Shape">change shape</a> universal monster ability.

Benefit: Your familiar's change shape universal monster ability can function as <a href="spelldisplay3b5b.html?ItemName=alter%20self">alter self</a>, and it gains a single alternate form of either Small or Medium size. This form is of a child or teenager of its master's species, and once chosen cannot be changed. Such changeling familiars always bear some kind of visible mark of their original nature, such as a cat's eyes, a serpent's tongue, or small demonic horns. The changeling familiar does not gain any new languages with this transformation, so changeling familiars are often mute.
