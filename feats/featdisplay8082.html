You can deliver touch spells with frightful ferocity.

Prerequisites: Caster level 5th.

Benefit: As long as two of your hands are free, you can cast a spell with a range of touch and deliver the spell to a single target as part of a charge action. When you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance, and the critical threat range of that touch attack is 19-20. This increased threat range does not stack with similar abilities such as Improved Critical.
