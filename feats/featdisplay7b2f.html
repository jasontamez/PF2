You can improve your arcane ammunition with more powerful magic.

Prerequisites: Int 15, <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplayf5a3.html?ItemName=Spell%20Cartridges">Spell Cartridges</a>, ability to cast 4th-level arcane spells, proficient with firearms.

Benefit: While your gun is imbued with power from the <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a> feat, you can spend a standard action to cast a spell of 3rd level or lower and deliver it via a force bullet. The spell must have a range of touch or produce a ray; if the spell would produce multiple rays, the bullet delivers the effect of only one ray. If the force bullet strikes a target, it deals its force damage and also delivers the effects of the spell. If the force bullet critically hits a target, the spell deals double damage.
