You can manage multiple contingency effects.

Prerequisites: Character level 19th.

Benefit: You can have two contingency effects active at one time. If they would both trigger on the same round, one (chosen randomly) does not trigger until 1 round later.

Normal: You can benefit from only a single contingency active at a time.
