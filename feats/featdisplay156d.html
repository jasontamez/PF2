Your shield bash throws your enemies off balance.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1341.html?ItemName=Improved%20Shield%20Bash">Improved Shield Bash</a>, <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplayb628.html?ItemName=Stumbling%20Bash">Stumbling Bash</a>, base attack bonus +11 or fighter level 8th.

Benefit: As a swift action when you hit a creature with a shield bash, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature at a -5 penalty. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity, and if your attempt fails by 10 or more, you are not knocked prone.
