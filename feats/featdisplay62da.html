Every killing blow gives you a surge of vitality, further fueling your rage.

Prerequisites: Greater rage class feature.

Benefit:  While raging, whenever your attack reduces an opponent of a CR greater than or equal to your character level to -1 or fewer hit points, you gain 1 extra round of rage for that day. If that attack was a critical hit, you gain 1 additional extra round of rage for that day. Whenever you rest to renew your total number of rounds of rage per day, any extra rounds you still have from this feat are lost.
