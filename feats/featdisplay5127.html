You are very difficult to follow in the wild, leaving few tracks in your wake.

Prerequisites: Survival 3 ranks.

Benefit: You increase the DC of Survival checks to track you by 5 when moving at full speed and by 10 when moving at half speed. You can cover the tracks of a number of allies within 30 feet equal to your Wisdom modifier plus half your character level, increasing the DC to track them by 2 if they are moving at full speed or by 5 if they are moving at half speed.

Special: If you have the favored terrain class feature and you are in that terrain, you also add your favored terrain bonus to the DC to track you or your allies.
