Even in youth, you seek to be more adult than your
childish peers, a personal trait that will no doubt aid you
in future years.


Prerequisites: Young age category.

Benefit:  You lose one of the penalties associated
with the young age category, either -2 Constitution, -2
Strength, or -2 Wisdom. Upon reaching adulthood you
may exchange this feat for Great Fortitude, Iron Will, or
Lightning Reflexes.


Special:  You may take this feat up to three times. Each
time you do, it affects a different penalty and must be
exchanged for a different feat upon reaching adulthood.
