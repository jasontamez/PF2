You can absorb hostile spell energy to refuel your continued bloodrage.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast 2nd-level bloodrager spells, bloodrage class feature.

Benefit: While you are bloodraging, if you successfully save against a damaging arcane spell that either targets you or includes you in its area, and you take no damage from that spell, you can absorb a portion of its arcane energy to replenish your bloodrage. You regain 1 round of bloodrage for every 2 levels of the spell you successfully saved against. You cannot use this feat to regain more rounds of bloodrage each day than your daily maximum number of rounds, nor can you ever exceed your maximum number of rounds.
