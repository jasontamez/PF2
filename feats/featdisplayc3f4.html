After misdirecting your opponent's weapon attack, you trick it into striking someone else.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplayf0f4.html?ItemName=Misdirection%20Tactics">Misdirection Tactics</a>, <a href="featdisplayc704.html?ItemName=Deceitful">Deceitful</a>, Bluff 10 ranks.

Benefit: When you successfully use the Misdirection Tactics feat to negate a melee weapon attack, you redirect your foe's attack and trick your foe into striking another creature of your choice within the foe's melee reach. To resolve this attack, your foe must make a new attack roll against the new target.
