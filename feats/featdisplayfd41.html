You scramble around your foes, moving and striking in an erratic fashion.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay03f4.html?ItemName=Monkey%20Style">Monkey Style</a>, Acrobatics 8 ranks, Climb 8 ranks.

Benefit:  While using Monkey Style, you gain a Wisdom bonus on Climb checks. You can also can climb and crawl at half your speed; you can take a 5-foot step by jumping, crawling, or climbing; and you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing. Further, while using Monkey Style, when you use your unarmed strike to hit an opponent twice or more on your turn, you can spend a swift action to take a 5-foot step even if you have moved this round.

Normal:  You climb at one-quarter your speed, and you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. A 5-foot step is made using your normal movement modes, and you can take one only if you have not otherwise moved this round.
