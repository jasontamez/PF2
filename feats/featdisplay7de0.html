Your stare penetrates right through your foe's strongest mental defenses.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.

Benefit: When you trigger your painful stare, the damage dealt ignores 5 points of the target's damage reduction, unless that damage reduction is untyped (for example, DR 10/-).
