With a dramatic flourish you display your weapons to the crowd. Onlookers are elated, and your enemies are demoralized.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a>, and proficiency with the selected weapon.

Benefit:  When you spend a swift action to make a performance combat check, you present the weapon in which you have Weapon Focus in a triumphant display. You gain a +2 bonus on the performance combat check and make an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet who can see your display.
