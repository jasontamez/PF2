You can convert mind-affecting magic to necromantic power capable of controlling undead.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks, <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (necromancy).</a>

Benefit:  This feat only works on mind-affecting spells. A threnodic spell affects undead creatures (even mindless undead) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on living creatures. A threnodic spell uses up a spell slot two level higher than the spell's actual level.

Normal:  Undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.
