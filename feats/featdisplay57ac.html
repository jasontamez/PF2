Geodes strengthen your physical prowess when you use them to cast transmutation spells.

Benefit: When you cast a transmutation spell using geodes as an esoteric material component, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks based on your choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (you make this choice each time). This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn.

When you gain geodes' greater component effect with a transmutation spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining the duration.
