As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, when you use a melee weapon that is not a thrown weapon for a ranged improvised weapon attack, you use the weapon's melee critical threat range and multiplier instead of the normal 20/??2 for improvised weapons. You can spend 2 stamina points to increase your range increment for thrown weapon attacks (including ranged improvised weapons) by 10 feet until the beginning of your next turn.
