Your healing energy also damages your enemies.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, <a href="featdisplay29d7.html?ItemName=Selective%20Channeling">Selective Channeling</a>, channel energy class feature.

Benefit: When you channel positive energy to heal, one creature that you exclude from your channeling takes an amount of fire damage equal to the die result you roll for healing, and is dazzled for 1 round by the light of these flames. A successful saving throw against your channel energy halves the fire damage and negates the dazzled effect.
