Hex Strike - Feats







Hex Strike (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 104</a>
Chanting and cursing, you put a hex on your enemy as part of your unarmed strike.

Prerequisites: Hex class feature, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit:  When you gain this feat, choose one hex that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen hex to that opponent. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying hex.

You can spend 5 stamina points to apply the effects of your chosen hex as a free action instead of a swift action.
