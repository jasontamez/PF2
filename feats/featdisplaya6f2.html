You can use the movements of the sun, moon, stars, and planets to navigate and acquire eldritch knowledge about the fundamental nature of reality.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (geography) skill checks to learn about the stars or planets. At night, as long as the sky is clear and you can see the stars, you cannot get lost. Once per night when the stars are visible, you can reroll a Knowledge check you failed earlier in the day. When you do so, you can choose to roll the appropriate Knowledge skill check again or you can instead use your Knowledge (geography) skill to gain the same information.
