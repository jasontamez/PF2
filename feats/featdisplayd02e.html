You are furious when destroying dangerous objects.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplayfa7c.html?ItemName=Gate%20Breaker">Gate Breaker</a>, <a href="featdisplay2c99.html?ItemName=Improved%20Sunder">Improved Sunder</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: Whenever you sunder a held object, its bearer must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or the bearer catches on fire (taking 1d6 points of fire damage immediately, and an additional 1d6 points of fire damage each subsequent round the creature fails a Reflex saving throw). When your total Hit Dice reach 5, this damage increases by 1d6, and it increases by 1d6 every 5 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5d6 at 20th level. The saving throw's DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma modifier.
