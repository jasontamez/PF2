As a standard action, you can spend 2 stamina points and make a ranged attack against a foe engaged in melee with an ally. If the attack hits, it deals no damage, but your ally gains your choice of either a +2 bonus on her next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent's next attack. This bonus lasts until the start of your next turn.
