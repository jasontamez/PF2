Manyshot - Feats







Manyshot (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 130</a>
You can fire multiple arrows at a single target.

Prerequisites: Dex 17, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: When making a full-attack action with a bow, your first attack fires two arrows. If the attack hits, both arrows hit. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. Damage bonuses from using a composite bow with a high Strength bonus apply to each arrow, as do other damage bonuses, such as a ranger's favored enemy bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each arrow.

When using this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points to fire two arrows with your final iterative attack during the full attack.

Mythic Manyshot

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 69</a>
You can fire a barrage of arrows at your target with very little effort.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf76c.html?ItemName=Manyshot">Manyshot.</a>

Benefit:  When making a full-attack action with a bow and using Manyshot, you fire two arrows with both your first and second attacks, instead of just your first attack.
