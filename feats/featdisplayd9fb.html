You can speak with burrowing animals.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, gnome, gnome magic racial trait.

Benefit:  You can use speak with animals as a spell-like ability at will, but only to communicate with burrowing animals like gophers, moles, and the like. You can still use your gnome speak with animals ability once per day to speak with any animal, as usual.
