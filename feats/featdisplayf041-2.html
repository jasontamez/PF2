When you lay on hands, you are also healed.

Prerequisites: Lay on hands class feature.

Benefit:  Each time you use your lay on hands ability to heal a creature other than yourself, you heal a number of hit points equal to your Charisma bonus. This ability has no effect if you use lay on hands to harm undead.
