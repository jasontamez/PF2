You have trained yourself to move and fight in strong winds, allowing you to use their elemental power to boost your own speed.

Prerequisites: Acrobatics or Fly 3 ranks.

Benefit: When flying within strong winds, you gain a foot bonus to your fly speed. For every wind strength category above strong, you gain an additional foot bonus to your fly speed (for a total of  feet in severe winds,  feet in a windstorm, and  feet in tornadoes). This feat does not give you any bonuses on Fly or Strength checks to determine if you are potentially checked or blown away.
