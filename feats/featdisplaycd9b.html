You've made your case to become one of Ragadahn's nobles in the traditional way-by carving your sigil and the Water Lord's ouroboros in the flesh of a living dragon or of another massive monstrosity-and earned some of his might as a reward.

Prerequisites: Fey creature type or <a href="spelldisplay187c.html?ItemName=Fey%20Obedience">Fey Obedience</a> (Ragadahn), you must have carved your name and Ragadahn's holy symbol on the hide of a living dragon or outsider with either the aquatic or water subtype and a CR at least 2 higher than your level when you took the feat.

Benefit: You claim ownership of that which you strike. If you have dealt hit point damage to a creature this round, that creature takes a -2 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to its CMD until the beginning of your next round.
