Your ritualistic training has taught you to join in with the magic of others.

Prerequisites: Ability to spontaneously cast spells.

Benefit:  As a standard action, select an ally within 30 feet who also has this feat and select a metamagic feat you have. If that ally doesn't have the selected metamagic feat, she can modify a spell she casts before the end of her next turn with that metamagic feat. The spell is modified as normal, except it uses a spell slot 1 additional level above the normal spell level modification for that metamagic feat.

If the selected ally does have the metamagic feat you select, she can instead use that feat to modify a spell she casts before the end of her next turn without increasing the spell's casting time.
