You've unlocked more than just the ability to emulate the claws of your draconic forebear.


Prerequisites: Access to natural claw attacks, bloodrager or sorcerer with the draconic bloodline.

Benefit: As a free action when manifesting claws (as per the sorcerer bloodline ability), you infuse yourself with other dormant powers of your draconic bloodline. If you're a bloodrager, you gain the benefits of this feat as a free action, but only while bloodraging; the ability lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. These rounds need not be used consecutively. Depending on the specific draconic bloodline you have, you gain one of the following abilities.

Chromatic: You become immune to paralysis and sleep effects.

Esoteric: You become partially incorporeal, gaining concealment (20%) against all incoming attacks.

Imperial: You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks for every 4 levels you have in a class that grants you a draconic bloodline. You also become immune to fear effects.

Metallic: You radiate a 10-foot aura of courage, inspiring those around you with your intensity. Allies within the aura gain a +2 morale bonus on saves against fear effects and spells with the evil descriptor. Allies already affected by a fear effect when they first enter the aura can attempt a new saving throw at the same DC as the original effect. On a successful save, the fear effect ends. A creature can benefit from this reroll only once per day.

Outer: You don't need to breathe and gain immunity to any gas-based or smell effects.

Primal: You radiate a 5-foot aura of elemental damage. Creatures within the aura take 1 point of damage for every 4 levels you have in a class that grants you a draconic bloodline. This damage is energy damage based on your chosen dragon type.
