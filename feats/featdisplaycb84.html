Mythic Trample

Your rearing mount can stomp foes into the ground, barely

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaycb84.html?ItemName=Trample">Trample.</a>

Benefit:  Your mount can make two hoof attacks against an opponent you knock down with an overrun, instead of one. You can expend one use of mythic power when you score a critical hit with one or more of those hoof attacks. When you do, the critical is automatically confirmed. If both scored critical hits, expending one use of mythic power automatically confirms both.
