You have a special knack for a certain profession and take
to it with ease.


Benefit:  Choose three character classes. For the
purposes of retraining, you are always considered to have
a retraining synergy with these classes, regardless of your
current class. Additionally, retraining any class option
takes you half the time it normally would (and thus half
the gp cost), though retraining a class still takes the
normal amount of time (5 days for a class with which you
have synergy, 7 for a class with which you don't). If you
take this feat via retraining or replace it with another feat
in the same manner, the retraining time takes twice as
long as normal in regards to this feat only.
