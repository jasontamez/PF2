You pass along private details to the Red Mantis, and they protect you in return.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb68a.html?ItemName=Associate">Associate (Red Mantis).</a>

Benefit:  The Red Mantis can help you hide from trouble in one of their secret safe houses. Anyone attempting Diplomacy or Survival checks to locate you during this time takes a -10 penalty, and anyone attempting to scry upon you or magically divine your location must first succeed at a caster level check (DC = 15 + your character level). You can stay in a Mantis safe house for up to 1 day per character level before you are forced to vacate.
