Your lack of regard for others proves a boon when you fire projectiles into melee.

Benefit:  When you shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee, you can choose to take a -1 penalty to your AC and gain a +2 competence bonus on your attack roll. However, when you roll a natural 1 on a ranged attack roll made with this bonus, you automatically hit a random adjacent creature that threatens your intended target.
