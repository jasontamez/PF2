You curse the blood of your foes, forcing them to falter in their subsequent actions.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 5 ranks.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can curse an enemy you've dealt damage to since your last turn. That target must succeed at a Will save or be unable to take a 5-foot step, delay an action, or ready an action for 1 round.

Special: A shaman or witch with this blood hex can use it against any creature she has dealt damage to in the past minute. A creature affected by this blood hex used by a shaman or witch also has its movement rate halved for the blood hex's duration.
