You can sweep multiple foes to the ground with a single blow of your axe.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplay2107.html?ItemName=Cleave">Cleave</a>, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (greataxe)</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  When using a full-attack action with a two-handed weapon, you can give up your regular attacks and instead attempt a trip combat maneuver at your highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. You must attempt a separate combat maneuver check against each opponent.
