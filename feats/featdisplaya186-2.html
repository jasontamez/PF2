You put yourself in danger's path to save your allies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay4ebc.html?ItemName=Bodyguard">Bodyguard.</a>

Benefit:  While using the aid another action to improve an adjacent ally's AC, you can intercept a successful attack against that ally as an immediate action, taking full damage from that attack and any associated effects (bleed, poison, etc.). A creature cannot benefit from this feat more than once per attack.

When using this feat's benefit, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to reduce the damage from the intercepted attack by an amount equal to double the number of stamina points you spent this way. This does not alter other effects from that attack (such as bleed, poison, etc.), even if the damage is reduced to 0.
