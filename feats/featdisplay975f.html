You can accept burn to gain the benefits of ki.

Prerequisites: <a href="classdisplaye4f2.html?ItemName=Brawler">Brawler's flurry</a> or <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">flurry of blows class feature</a>, burn class feature, <a href="kineticisttalentsdisplayf96c.html?ItemName=Kinetic%20Fist">kinetic fist wild talent</a>, <a href="classdisplayc359.html?ItemName=Kineticist">kineticist level 4th</a>.

Benefit: Your burn functions like a ki pool. As long as you have at least 1 point of burn, your unarmed strikes count as magic. You can take 1 point of burn as a swift action to do any two of the following: make an additional attack at your highest bonus during a flurry of blows, increase your speed by 20 feet for 1 round, or gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. You can also accept burn instead of spending ki (or a combination of the two) to activate an ability that costs ki points, with each point of burn you accept counting as 2 ki points. You count as having a ki pool for effects that requires a ki pool.
