You attack with a second strike before your opponent can recover from the first.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay113a.html?ItemName=Deft%20Hands">Deft Hands</a>, base attack bonus +7, <a href="racesdisplay6f1b.html?ItemName=Wyrwood">wyrwood</a>.

Benefit: When you successfully damage an enemy with the first attack of a full attack, you can attempt a Sleight of Hand check against that enemy's CMD as an immediate action. If you succeed, you can treat that enemy as flat-footed for the next attack you make as part of the full attack action.
