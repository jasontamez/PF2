Your skill with improvised weapons makes them more dangerous than they would otherwise be.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf03d.html?ItemName=Catch%20Off-Guard">Catch Off-Guard</a> or <a href="featdisplay8204.html?ItemName=Throw%20Anything">Throw Anything</a>.

Benefit: While in this style, you deal damage with improvised weapons as if they were one size category larger. For every style feat you have that lists Shikigami Style as a prerequisite, treat the improvised weapon as an additional size category larger, to a maximum of three sizes larger than its actual size.
