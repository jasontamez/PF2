You cow your enemies with the lash of a whip.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1, Intimidate 1 rank, hobgoblin.

Benefit:  To use this feat, you must use a whip (or another weapon in the flails fighter weapon group) to attack a foe demoralized by an Intimidate check. If the attack hits, you extend the duration the creature is shaken by 1 round. This feat has no effect on creatures whose shaken conditions are from sources other than Intimidate checks.
