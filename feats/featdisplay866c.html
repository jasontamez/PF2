You are so skilled with firearms that you can fire one without letting down your guard.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +4, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (any firearm)</a>, proficiency with any firearm.

Benefit: When you attack with a firearm, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Normal: Attacking with any kind of ranged weapon in a threatened square provokes attacks of opportunity.
