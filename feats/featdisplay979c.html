You can infuse your elemental spells with primal magic.

Benefit: Once per day, when you cast a spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, you can infuse the spell with primal magic and transform its elemental energy at random. After you cast the spell but before its effects are resolved, roll 1d4 to determine the new element (1 = acid, 2 = cold, 3 = electricity, 4 = fire). If you are in an area where primal magic is predominant, you can instead use this ability once per hour.
