When you're dealing with large and secretive organizations,
a dead enemy is just a corpse, but a captured enemy can be
a tool.


Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +3.

Benefit:  If you deal an amount of damage to a creature
that would slay it outright, you can pull that attack, instead
dealing only enough damage to reduce its hit points to -1,
and leave it stable.
