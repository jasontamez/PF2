Your battle songs can drive your fellow goblins to new heights of frenzy.

Prerequisites: Goblin, bardic performance class feature.

Benefit:  When using bardic performance to inspire courage in allies, you can choose to sing in Goblin-allies who do not speak Goblin gain no benefits from this performance.
