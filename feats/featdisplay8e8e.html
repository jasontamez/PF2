Extra Gnome Magic - Feats







Extra Gnome Magic

The raw magic that flows through your gnome blood is stronger than normal.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Gnome.

Benefit: You gain an additional three uses per day of your gnome spell-like abilities (dancing lights, ghost sound, prestidigitation). You can use these in any combination; for example, you can use dancing lights four times in one day (taking all three additional uses for the same spell), or you can cast ghost sound twice, prestidigitation twice, speak with animals twice, and dancing lights once. If you have a feat, trait, or other ability that changes your racial 0-level spell-like abilities to other 0-level spells, this feat applies to them instead.
