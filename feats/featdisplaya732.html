You bear intricate tattoos that inspire and empower your natural magic ability. These tattoos mark you as a worker of the ancient traditions of Varisian magic. A Varisian tattoo typically consists of a long string of complex characters from the Thassilonian alphabet.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus.</a>

Benefit: Select a school of magic (other than divination) in which you have Spell Focus-you cast spells from this school at +1 caster level. Additionally, you gain a single spell-like ability usable up to three times per day. The spell-like ability gained (and its Varisian name) are as follows:

Abjuration (avidais): resistance
Conjuration (idolis): acid splash
Enchantment (carnasia): daze
Evocation (ragario): dancing lights
Illusion (vangloris): ghost sound
Necromancy (voratalo): touch of fatigue
Transmutation (avaria): mage hand
