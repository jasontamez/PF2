Your foes flee when you appear suddenly.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8cb3.html?ItemName=Frightening%20Ambush">Frightening Ambush</a>, Intimidate 5 ranks.

Benefit:  When using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent during a surprise round, if you exceed the DC by 10 or more, you can make the target frightened for 1 round instead of shaken.
