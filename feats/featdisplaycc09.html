Your knack for unlocking the true potential of magical equipment allows you to draw great power from your equipment.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6e0d.html?ItemName=Collector's%20Boon">Collector's Boon</a>, character level 9th.

Benefit: While you are wearing or wielding at least three items from a <a href="magicsets0d47.html?ItemName=All">set</a>, you can gain the benefits of the three-, four-, and five-item benefits listed in the set, as appropriate for the total number of pieces of the set in your possession. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Magic Device checks as long as you are currently wearing or wielding at least five pieces of magical equipment (such as magic armor, magic weapons, magic rings, or wondrous items). For the purposes of determining whether you gain this benefit, gauntlets that are part of a suit of magic armor count as a separate magic item only if they have been enchanted as weapons.
