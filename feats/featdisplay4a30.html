You knock the sense out of foes with a well-timed surprise attack.

Prerequisites: Sneak attack +3d6, <a href="featdisplayad0c.html?ItemName=Sap%20Adept">Sap Adept.</a>

Benefit:  Whenever you use a bludgeoning weapon to deal nonlethal sneak attack damage to a flat-footed opponent, roll your sneak attack dice twice, totaling the results as your nonlethal sneak attack damage for that attack.
