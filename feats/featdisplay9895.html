You have mastered acrobatic maneuvers that turn even your retreats into breathtaking feats of skill.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, Acrobatics 7 ranks.

Benefit:  When you must attempt a performance combat check because you used the withdraw action, you can attempt an Acrobatics check against your opponent's CMD before the performance combat check. Success allows you to withdraw without taking the standard -5 penalty on your check. In addition, for every 5 points by which your Acrobatics check result exceeds your opponent's CMD, you gain a +1 bonus on all Perform checks you make for the remainder of the round.

When you use Spectacular Exit to withdraw without taking the -5 penalty on performance combat checks and you spend 5 stamina points, you don't need to succeed at an Acrobatics check in order to avoid the penalty.
