You can goad an opponent into attacking you in order to make your counter attack all the more powerful.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1698.html?ItemName=Toughness">Toughness</a>, base attack bonus +1, orc.

Benefit:  As a move action, you can leave a gap in your defenses for one adjacent opponent to use. If the opponent attacks you on its next turn, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll. Whether or not the opponent successfully hits, you may attack it as an immediate action with a single melee attack, gaining a +2 bonus on your attack roll.

You can spend 2 stamina points to make the attack granted by this feat as a free action rather than an immediate action. You can still make the attack only once per use of this feat.
