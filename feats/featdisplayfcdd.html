You learn from your mistakes rapidly when others lower their guard around you.

Benefit: When you make an attack of opportunity in a single round after you have already made an unsuccessful attack of opportunity that round, you gain a cumulative +2 insight bonus on your attack roll for each unsuccessful attack of opportunity. For example, if you have made one unsuccessful attack of opportunity and an enemy provokes another attack of opportunity from you during that same round, you gain a +2 insight bonus on that attack roll, and if you have made two unsuccessful attacks of opportunity in a round and an enemy provokes another attack of opportunity from you during that same round, you gain a +4 insight bonus on that attack roll, and so on.
