Rather than attempting a series of wild blows, you line up a perfect attack.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: You can focus yourself as a move action. When focused, you gain a +4 bonus on your next melee attack roll before the end of your turn.
