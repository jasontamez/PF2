You have a measure of flexibility when preparing spells.


Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, ability to
prepare and cast 4th-level spells.

Benefit:  Once per day when you prepare spells, you can
designate one spell slot from each of up to three different
spell levels that are lower than the highest-level spell that
you can cast. In each designated slot you can memorize two
different spells of the respective level. You can cast either
spell as normal, but when you do, the spell consumes both of
the spells prepared in that spell slot.


Special:  A wizard can select this feat as one of his
bonus feats.
