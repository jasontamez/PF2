Your magical nature infuses your vines, further obscuring grappled foes' vision-even for opponents with enhanced senses.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 6th, <a href="featdisplay510b.html?ItemName=Greater%20Grapple">Greater Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaye14a.html?ItemName=Kudzu%20Grappler">Kudzu Grappler</a>, <a href="featdisplayf728-2.html?ItemName=Kudzu%20Invasion">Kudzu Invasion</a>, <a href="featdisplay6d7b.html?ItemName=vine%20leshy">vine leshy</a>.

Benefit: Opponents blinded by your <a href="featdisplaye14a.html?ItemName=Kudzu%20Grappler">Kudzu Grappler</a> feat increase their miss chance against creatures they attack by 20%. If the opponent has means of ignoring blindness, such as blindsight, they instead treat other creatures as if these creatures had normal concealment (20% miss chance).

Normal: All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) against blinded creatures.
