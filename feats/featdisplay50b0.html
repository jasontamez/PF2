You can glean the interests of others and use that information to strengthen your rhetoric.

Prerequisites: Int 19, <a href="featdisplay0af9.html?ItemName=Ironclad%20Logic">Ironclad Logic</a>, Diplomacy 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks.

Benefit: When you use Diplomacy to change the attitude of a character, you can first attempt a Sense Motive check against that NPC to get a hunch to determine whether the character is under the influence of an enchantment, to use Sense Assumptions, or to determine biases for a verbal duel. If you succeed at the Sense Motive check, you gain a +2 bonus on the Diplomacy check, and if you learned any biases for a verbal duel, you learn one additional bias of your choice. You do not worsen an NPC's attitude if you fail a Diplomacy check by 5 or more.
