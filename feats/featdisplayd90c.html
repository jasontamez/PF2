Your charms and enchantments reach the minds of even the lowliest dungeon denizens.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (enchantment)</a>, Knowledge (dungeoneering) 6 ranks.

Benefit:  This feat only works with mind-affecting effects. A coaxing spell affects mindless oozes and vermin as if they weren't mindless, but has no effect on other creature types. A coaxing spell uses a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
