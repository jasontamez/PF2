Your venom is powerful enough to seep into the Ethereal Plane.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 9 ranks, vishkanya.

Benefit: For a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, a weapon envenomed by your vishkanya venom gains the ghost touch special ability and deals 1d6 additional points of damage against incorporeal foes. This affects creatures even if they are immune to poison effects. If the weapon is used to attack a corporeal creature, the venom is expended and the effects it granted to your weapon end.

Normal: Vishkanya venom deals Dexterity damage.
