Thief of Legend (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8x64?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Campaign">Ultimate Campaign pg. 73</a>
More than just a burglar, you aspire to commit crimes of
legendary stature.


Prerequisites: You must have stolen at least 1, 000
gp worth of treasure without being caught and kept
mementos of these thefts worth at least 500 gp, or have
the Greed background.

Benefit:  Once per day when you attempt a Disable Device
check to open a lock or Sleight of Hand check to pick a
pocket, you can roll twice and take the better result.


Goal:  Steal a famous and well-guarded treasure worth
at least 50,000 gp while leaving no evidence of your
involvement behind. The treasure must be protected by a
mix of at least 8 traps or challenging foes. Any guardians
need not be defeated, merely bypassed. You don't need to
keep the treasure, and you can boast of the theft afterward.


Completion Benefit:  You gain the ability to reactively
disarm a trap. When you trigger a trap, you can attempt
a Disable Device check with a -5 penalty to interrupt
the trap's function, leaving it still armed but effectively
preventing it from activating. You can use this ability a
number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence
modifier. Since the trap is still armed, it might activate
again if you don't immediately back away or otherwise
avoid repeating the act that set it off the first time.
