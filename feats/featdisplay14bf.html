You know your local community like the back of your hand.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (local) 2 ranks, must have lived in the settlement for at least 1 year.

Benefit: Select a permanent, stationary settlement. While in that settlement, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks, as per the ranger's favored terrain class feature. If you already have that class feature and apply its bonuses in your favored community, increase the bonus provided by favored terrain by 2. The bonuses from this feat do not stack with other effects that provide or augment favored terrain bonuses, such as boots of friendly terrain (Advanced Player's Guide 301).
