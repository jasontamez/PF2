You can channel even more energy into weapons and armor to grant them several divine powers at once.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay15cf.html?ItemName=Bless%20Equipment">Bless Equipment</a>, caster level 9th, channel energy class feature.

Benefit:  The number of uses of channeled energy you must expend to bless a piece of equipment using Bless Equipment and Align Equipment decreases by one (to a minimum of one use of channel energy per blessing).

You can also bless a piece of equipment with up to two blessings at a time. Each blessing provides a different special ability drawn from the Bless Equipment list (and the Align Equipment list if you possess that feat). You must still have a high enough caster level to bless a piece of equipment with each of the selected blessings.

You expend the appropriate number of uses of channeled energy required for each blessing, taking into account the reduction granted by this feat (and the increase for blessing a masterwork item, if needed). For example, a cleric with this feat would need to expend two uses of channeled energy to bless a weapon with the undead-bane and ghost touch special abilities (one use for bane plus one use for ghost touch).

If a given piece of equipment already has a blessing on it, you can give it a second blessing. When another blessing is applied to a piece of equipment that currently has a blessing active on it, the durations for the two blessings are tracked separately.
