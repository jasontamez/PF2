You have the ability to create rare and valuable items
from the bodies of fallen true dragons.

Prerequisites: Craft (any) 5 ranks, Knowledge (arcana)
3 ranks.

Benefit: You gain the ability to create a variety of <a href="equipmentmiscc5d0.html?Category=Dragoncraft">dragoncraft items</a> from materials gathered from the bodies of true dragons (not lesser dragons, such as linnorms or wyverns). Crafting dragoncraft items takes 1 hour per 100 gp of items being produced. In order to gather specimens from a dragon's corpse, you must succeed at a Heal check equal to 10 + the dragon's CR within 48 hours of the dragon's death (unless the body is preserved in some way). Refer to the table below to determine how much of a given material can be harvested from a dragon based on its size.

Special: Normally, if a suit of dragonhide armor has energy immunity, one may enhance such a suit with additional energy protection for the wearer at a 25% reduced cost. However, only effects with the same elemental type as the armor's immunity are eligible for this discount. An artisan with the Dragoncrafting feat may add 1 additional elemental protection to a suit of dragonhide armor at the same 25% discount, even if this energy resistance is not normally associated with the type of dragonhide being used.
