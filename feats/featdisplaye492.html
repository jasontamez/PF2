Your heritage is strange or difficult to trace, and people fear your otherworldly powers.

Prerequisites: Changeling.

Benefit:  Your mother was part of a powerful hag coven, and it shows when you are near your kin. As long as you are within 30 feet of at least two other changelings, you gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks and dispel checks. If at least two of these changelings also have this feat, these bonuses increase to +4.

Special:  This version of Unusual Origin is a teamwork feat.
