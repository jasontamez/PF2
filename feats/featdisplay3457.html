You can take advantage of your opponent's confusion, delivering multiple blows.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay4c66.html?ItemName=Gorgon's%20Fist">Gorgon's Fist</a>, <a href="featdisplay3693.html?ItemName=Scorpion%20Style">Scorpion Style</a>, base attack bonus +11.

While using this feat, you can spend 10 stamina points to make the bonus attacks against a foe that you are flanking, instead of only a dazed, flat-footed, paralyzed, staggered, stunned, or unconscious foe.

Mythic Medusa's Wrath

Your barrage of unarmed attacks builds to a single, staggering strike.

Prerequisites: Medusa's Wrath.

Benefit:  You may forgo the two additional unarmed strikes of Medusa's Wrath to instead make a single unarmed strike at your highest base attack bonus. If you successfully hit your opponent, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1 round. You can expend one use of mythic power when you stagger a target with Medusa's Wrath to extend the duration of the staggered condition by a number of rounds equal to half your tier.
