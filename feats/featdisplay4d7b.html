Your unarmed strikes are as precise as they are powerful, but they leave you open and you can pursue foes with blinding speed.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, <a href="featdisplay7e31-3.html?ItemName=Tiger%20Claws">Tiger Claws</a>, <a href="featdisplay8426.html?ItemName=Tiger%20Style">Tiger Style</a>, base attack bonus +9 or monk level 8th.

Benefit:  While using the Tiger Style feat, you can apply the penalty from Power Attack to your AC instead of attack rolls. Additionally, once per round as a swift action, you can move up to half your speed closer to a target you hit with an unarmed strike or made a successful combat maneuver against on this turn or your last turn.

When using Tiger Style, you can spend 2 stamina points and take a swift action to move closer to an enemy you've hit with an unarmed strike or made a successful combat maneuver against at any point during this combat, instead of one you hit on this or your last turn.
