You can change your toxic blood to unravel magic itself.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 7 ranks, vishkanya.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can alter the effects of your venom to affect magic instead of flesh. Your venom functions as a targeted dispel magic effect when it strikes a creature, using your character level as your caster level. This dispelling effect affects creatures even if they are immune to poison effects.

Normal: Vishkanya venom deals Dexterity damage.
