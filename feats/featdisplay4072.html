Greater Reposition - Feats







Greater Reposition (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 161</a>
When you reposition foes, they are left vulnerable to the attacks of your allies.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Reposition">Improved Reposition</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to reposition a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Reposition. Whenever you reposition a foe, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).

Normal:  Creatures moved by reposition do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When attempting to reposition a foe, you can spend 5 stamina points to increase your melee reach by 5 feet for the purpose of determining where you can move the foe.
