Your familiar is different from others of its kind.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Cha 13, familiar class feature.

Benefit:  Select an evolution from the list of 1-point evolutions available to a summoner's eidolon. Your familiar has this evolution. The familiar must conform to any limitations of the evolution. For instance, no familiars can benefit from the mount evolution and only familiars with wings can take the wing buffet evolution.

If you gain a new familiar, your old familiar loses all evolutions, and you can select a new 1-point evolution for the new familiar.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects stack, granting a new 1-point evolution to your familiar each time you gain this feat.
