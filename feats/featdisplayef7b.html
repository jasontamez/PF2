Tyrant's Rebuke - Feats







Tyrant's Rebuke (Conduit)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpya1am">Planar Adventures pg. 33</a>
By decree of Asmodeus, Hell is a place antithetical to free will; wielding its power humbles foes and renders them vulnerable to your commands. Those who you target with a pointed rebuke feel as if the disdain of Hell itself has turned its attention to their acts.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack. A creature successfully hit by this touch attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or be staggered until the end of your next turn. If you use Tyrant's Rebuke on a creature that is already staggered by this effect and it fails its Will save, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage in addition to being staggered.

You can use this feat once per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
