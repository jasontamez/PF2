Your spirit lingers long after any other's would have passed on.

Prerequisites: Con 13, <a href="featdisplayc50c.html?ItemName=Diehard">Diehard</a>, <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance</a>, half-orc or orc.

Benefit:  When you are killed by hit point damage, your soul lingers in your body for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus. You are still dead, but a creature can make a DC 10 Heal check as a standard action to realize that you can still be saved. You can be healed by magic as if you were alive. If you are healed enough hit points that you would no longer be dead, you are alive again, but you gain one permanent negative level.
