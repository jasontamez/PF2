Your masked face makes your intentions nearly impossible to discern.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayfd54.html?ItemName=Nameless%20One">Nameless One.</a>

Benefit: While you're benefiting from the Nameless One feat, your intentions become difficult to read. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on opposed Bluff checks, and increase the DC by 4 of checks to gather information about you using Diplomacy, to answer questions about you or your abilities or weaknesses using the appropriate Knowledge skill, or to identify any spells or spell-like abilities that you cast using Spellcraft. If you have 10 or more ranks in any of these skills, the bonus for that skill or increase to that DC increases to +8.
