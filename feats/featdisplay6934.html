You are trained in the legendary methods of Lastwall's heavy cavalry and can steer your mount with great accuracy, even in tight confines.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat</a>, Handle Animal 4 ranks, Ride 9 ranks, Lastwall affinity.

Benefit: When mounted on a horse, you and your mount suffer no penalties for squeezing when you share a 10-foot space with another mount and rider with this feat. In addition, you and your mount gain a +2 bonus on opposed bull rush, overrun, and trip checks.

Normal: Horses and other Large mounts occupy a 10 foot square area. For two horses to share that space requires them to squeeze, halving their movement rate and imposing a -4 penalty on attack rolls and to AC.
