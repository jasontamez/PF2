Lingering Invisibility

You remain briefly translucent after losing invisibility.

Prerequisites: Duergar.

Benefit:  When your invisibility ends, you gain concealment for 1 round per minute of duration the invisibility effect had remaining (minimum 1 round). This only occurs if the invisibility is from your racial spell-like ability or a spell you cast. Effects that negate invisibility negate this concealment.
