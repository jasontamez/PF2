Using leverage and pure brawn, you can cling to a cliff face, ladder, or rope with your legs to free both of your hands to take other actions.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Climb 3 ranks.

Benefit: As a move action while climbing, you can cling to your climbing surface with your legs by succeeding at a Climb check with the same DC as that of climbing the surface as a move action. If successful, you can make attacks with a two-handed ranged weapon and reload ranged weapons until you resume climbing. The GM can rule that this feat doesn't work on certain climbing surfaces.
