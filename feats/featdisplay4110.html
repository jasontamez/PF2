Whether by magic or a curse of your blood, some part of you is more beast than man.

Prerequisites: wild shape class feature, see Special.

Benefit: Your bestial nature manifests itself in one of the following ways. You choose the manifestation when you choose the feat, and then you cannot change it.

Night Senses (Ex): If your base race has normal vision, you gain low-light vision. If your base race has low-light vision, you gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If your base race has darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.
Claws of the Beast (Ex): You grow a pair of claws. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if you are Small).
Predator's Leap (Ex): You can make a running jump without needing to run 10 feet before you jump.
Wild Instinct (Ex): You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +2 bonus on Survival skill checks.


Special:  A character that has contracted lycanthropy can take this feat without having to meet the prerequisites. A ranger who selects the natural weapon combat style can take this feat without having to meet the prerequisites (even if he does not select Aspect of the Beast as a bonus feat).

Your blood burns with savage fury, giving you bestial powers and abilities.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay4110.html?ItemName=Aspect%20of%20the%20Beast">Aspect of the Beast.</a>

Benefit:  Your bestial nature manifests itself in one of the following ways. You choose the manifestation when you choose the feat, and you can't change it.

Mythic Senses (Ex): If you have normal vision, you gain darkvision 30 feet. If you have low-light vision, you gain darkvision 60 feet. If you have darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet plus 10 feet per tier.

Mythic Claws (Ex): You grow a pair of powerful claws. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if you're Small). If you already have claws, the damage they deal increases by one die type (d4s become d6s, d3s become d4s, and so on). You can expend one use of mythic power when you hit with both claws during the same round to rend with those claws, dealing extra damage equal to one claw's damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus.

Mythic Leap (Ex): You can make a running jump without needing to run 10 feet beforehand. In addition, you gain a +5 bonus on your Acrobatics checks to determine the success of that jump and the distance covered. If you already have the predator's leap manifestation of Aspect of the Beast, the bonus on your Acrobatics checks increases to +10.

Mythic Instinct (Ex): You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +2 bonus on Survival checks. These bonuses stack with those gained from the wild instinct manifestation of Aspect of the Beast.
