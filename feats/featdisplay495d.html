Your good luck helps you and your business persevere
even during the most troublesome times.


Prerequisites: Own at least one building.

Benefit:  During the Event phase of downtime, if an
event occurs and the GM rolls on a building event table
or organization event table (see pages 114-129 of Ultimate
Campaign), you may, once per week, choose to roll twice
on the applicable table and choose either result. You must
declare you are using this feat before the results of the
initial roll are revealed.
