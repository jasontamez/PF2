Sonic Croak

Your croak creates powerful sound waves that you can direct at fragile targets.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya765.html?ItemName=Throat%20Pouch">Throat Pouch</a>, boggard, terrifying croak.

Benefit:  When you use your terrifying croak ability, instead of it imparting its normal effect, you can choose to deal 1d4 points of sonic damage to creatures in a 15-foot cone (Fortitude half ). The DC of this Fortitude save is the same as that of your terrifying croak. For every 3 Hit Dice you possess, the damage dealt increases by 1d4.

Special:  The Throat Pouch feat increases the size of this feat's cone by 5 feet for every 6 HD you have, not every 2 HD.
