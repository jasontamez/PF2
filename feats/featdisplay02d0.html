Life in the Mana Wastes, where magic has unpredictable and often fatal effects, has taught you to disable spellcasters with your firearms.

Prerequisites: Amateur Gunslinger or the grit class feature, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit:  If you ready a ranged attack with a firearm to attack a spellcaster when he begins casting a spell and successfully hit your opponent, you can expend 1 grit point to increase the target's concentration check DC for being injured while casting by 5.
