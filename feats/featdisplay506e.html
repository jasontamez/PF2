You strike with surprise and then run circles around your foe.

Prerequisites: Startling appearance class feature.

Benefit: During a surprise round, after taking an attack action to attack a creature unaware of your presence, you can take a move action to move. If you are already capable of taking both a standard and a move action in the surprise round, this feat does not grant you any additional actions.

Normal: You can take only a single standard or move action during a surprise round.
