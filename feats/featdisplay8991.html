You strengthen your crippled wings.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Fly)</a>, strix, wing-clipped racial trait.

Benefit:  Your strix racial fly speed increases to 60 feet (average). You ignore the wing-clipped trait's Fly check requirement to fly upward.
