You were born with the power to drive ice and snow as others drive their slaves.

Prerequisites: Sorcerer, Irrisen affinity, may only be taken at first level.

Benefit: All of your spells with the cold descriptor are cast at +1 caster level. Any spell with a different energy descriptor is cast at -1 caster level. Three times per day you may alter a spell you cast to deal cold damage instead of its normal damage; your +1 caster level for this feat applies to this variant casting.
