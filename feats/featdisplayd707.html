You are skilled at using others' spellbooks.

Prerequisites: Ability to prepare arcane spells.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to decipher arcane magical writing (such as a single spell in another's spellbook or on a scroll). Additionally, you can gain the boons from up to two preparation rituals at once. You must have access to both preparation rituals while preparing your spells, and must prepare at least three spells or formulae (discounting 0-level spells) from each book. If the rituals are both in the same book, you must prepare at least three spells from the spellbook of 1st level or higher for each preparation ritual from which you benefit.
