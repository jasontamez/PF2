You can instantly conjure an infernal contract into being.

Prerequisites: Devil subtype.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can produce an infernal contract. To receive the contract's benefit, a mortal creature must sign its name of its own free will. When it does so, that mortal's soul is sworn to Hell. As long as the infernal contract remains in effect, the victim cannot be restored to life after death save by a miracle or a wish. If the mortal is restored to life, you immediately sense it and gain the benefits of a discern location spell targeting the resurrected creature.
