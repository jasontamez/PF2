Subjective Slam (Combat)

When in control of gravity, you can use your momentum to cause brutal impacts, transforming the very act of falling into a devastating weapon.

Prerequisites: Con 13; Wis 13; <a href="featdisplayd30b.html?ItemName=Subjective%20Mobility">Subjective Mobility</a>; base attack bonus +4 or monk level 3rd.

Benefit: While on a plane with subjective directional gravity, you halve all damage you take from impacts (such as falling damage). While on such a plane, if your "fall" would cause you to collide with a creature or object, you can slam into it with devastating force as a standard action. You must succeed at a touch attack to slam a creature or object, with a cumulative -1 penalty for every 50 feet of your current falling speed; at the GM's discretion, you can automatically hit vast objects such as walls. A creature or object hit by this slam takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 50 feet of current falling speed, to a maximum of 6d6, and begins falling at your current speed according to your current subjective directional gravity.
