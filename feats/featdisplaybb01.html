Sin-Sharing Critical (Combat, Critical)

Your hateful focus can sometimes spread your own misfortune to others in combat.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a>, base attack bonus +13.

Benefit:  Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an opponent, you can choose a single curse effect currently affecting you to also affect the target. The target can negate this magical effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus). If you are currently affected by multiple curses, you choose which one affects the target. This transferred curse affects the target exactly as it affects you, except that it lasts 1d4 minutes or the remaining duration of the curse affecting you, whichever is less. If the target succeeds at its Will save, or if you are not suffering from any curse effects, the target instead rolls twice on its next ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check and takes the less favorable result. This is a curse effect.

Special:  You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you have Critical Mastery.
