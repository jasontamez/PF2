You can infuse a poison with a magical effect.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2e88.html?ItemName=Brew%20Potion">Brew Potion</a>, Craft (alchemy) 5 ranks, caster level 3rd.

Benefit:  You can infuse an ingested poison with any spell of 3rd level or lower that you know and that targets one or more creatures and has a casting time of less than 1 minute. Infusing a poison takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less; otherwise, infusing a poison takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. When you infuse a poison, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own caster level. To infuse a poison, you must use up raw materials costing half of its base price.

When you create an infused poison, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell.

Whoever ingests the infused poison is the target of the spell.
