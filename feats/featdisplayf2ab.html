When no allies are nearby, you can safely unleash the full extent of your fury.

Prerequisites: Rage class feature, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: While raging, when you make a full attack with a melee weapon, you can expend an extra round of rage and make one additional attack at your highest base attack bonus, taking a -2 penalty on all of your attacks and a -2 penalty to your AC until your next turn. You cannot use this ability if there are any allies within 5 feet of you or of any squares you threaten. This benefit does not stack with similar effects, such as haste.
