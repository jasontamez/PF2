Your acid-dripping breath causes those you bite to become ill.

Prerequisites: Acidic breath weapon, bite attack.

Benefit: Your bite attack deals 1 point of acid damage in addition to its normal damage. Living creatures you bite must make a Fort save (DC equal to your breath weapon's DC) or be nauseated for a number of rounds equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round).
