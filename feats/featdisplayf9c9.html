Deflect Arrows - Feats







Deflect Arrows (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 121</a>
You can knock arrows and other projectiles off course, preventing them from hitting you.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit: You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged weapon, you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged attack doesn't count as an action. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects can't be deflected.
