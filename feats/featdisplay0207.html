You can strike at weapons to upset enemy attacks.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, proficiency with bucklers.

Benefit: You can shield bash with a buckler as if it were a light shield, and you can use the buckler in conjunction with any feats or abilities that normally apply to light shields. While using this style, whenever you successfully deal damage to an opponent with a shield bash using your buckler, that opponent takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made against you until the start of your next turn.
