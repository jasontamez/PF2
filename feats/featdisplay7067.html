Dance of Chains - Feats







Dance of Chains (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 178</a>
In your hands, a spiked chain dances like a living thing.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay920a.html?ItemName=Chain%20Mastery">Chain Mastery</a>, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain)</a>, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, Perform (dance) 1 rank.

Benefit: When wielding a spiked chain one-handed, you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to that weapon's damage. The spiked chain must be one appropriate for your size. During your turn, you treat your reach with the spiked chain as 5 feet greater. You lose these benefits while fighting with multiple weapons or when using a shield (but not when using a buckler).
