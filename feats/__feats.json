			"Some abilities are not tied to your race, class, or skill-things like particularly quick reflexes that allow you to react to danger more swiftly, the ability to craft magic items, the training to deliver powerful strikes with melee weapons, or the knack for deflecting arrows fired at you. These abilities are represented as feats. While some feats are more useful to certain types of characters than others, and many of them have special prerequisites that must be met before they are selected, as a general rule feats represent abilities outside of the normal scope of your character's race and class. Many of them alter or enhance class abilities or soften class restrictions, while others might apply bonuses to your statistics or grant you the ability to take actions otherwise prohibited to you. By selecting feats, you can customize and adapt your character to be uniquely yours.",

These armor tricks are often used to supplement the modest defense provided by lighter armors by maximizing flexibility and mobility.",
			"Combat Acrobatics (Int 13, Combat Expertise, Acrobatics 3 ranks): You have trained yourself to expose only armored sections of your body when performing flips and rolls, leaving you less distracted by concerns about being struck in combat. You are not considered flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move on narrow surfaces and uneven ground without falling, and do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while doing so. Additionally, if you use Combat Expertise to increase your AC, the DC for you to use Acrobatics to move through a threatened square at full speed without provoking an attack of opportunity by 10 does not increase.",
			"Reactive Mobility (Mobility, Nimble Moves): Practice has honed your reactions so that you react quickly and instinctively to threats. You add your dodge bonus granted by Mobility to your AC against all attacks of opportunity that you provoke, not just against those that are caused when you move out of or within a threatened area.",
			"Reflexive Mobility (Combat Reflexes, Mobility): You have learned to sacrifice an opportunity to wound an opponent in order to avoid being wounded yourself. When you provoke an attack of opportunity from an opponent, you can expend one of your own potential attacks of opportunity for that round to double the bonus to your AC that you gain from the Mobility feat against that attack. This benefit applies to all attacks of opportunity that you provoke with the same action. If you are unable to take any more attacks of opportunity this turn, you cannot use this ability.",
			"Sliding Charge (Improved Trip, base attack bonus +4): You can use your momentum to confound your opponents. Whenever you charge an opponent and attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that opponent as a melee attack, you can drop to the ground as a swift action in order to slide into your target. When doing so, you add your Dexterity bonus (up to your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus) to the combat maneuver check. Whether or not you succeed at the check, you are prone at the end of your charge.",

			"Source ~`Armor Master's Handbook pg. 8`~",
			"Many of these armor tricks originated in Andoran and are employed by various branches of the Eagle Knights, who highly value the greater protection provided by medium armor but want to retain f lexibility and agility in combat. Armor Focus, which is a prerequisite for two of these tricks, can be found on page 16.",
			"Acrobatic Sit-Up (Mobility, Acrobatics 5 ranks): You have developed the ability to recover from a fall and attack an opponent in a single fluid movement. Whenever you are prone, you can make an attack against a single foe and stand from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity from that foe. Make a single melee attack against one target without the normal penalties for attacking while prone. If you hit your target, you can immediately stand from prone (normally a move action) without provoking an attack of opportunity from that target for doing so. Any other target that threatens you can still make an attack of opportunity against you. If your attack fails, you provoke attacks of opportunity from all threatening foes and cannot stand until your next turn.",

			"Light Versatility (Armor Focus, Armor Trick [Light Armor]): You are so comfortable in your armor that it seems lighter than it is. You can treat medium armor as light armor for the purpose of what armor tricks you can perform in it.",
			"Roll into the Blow (Mobility): You keep your wits about you when attacked and can turn the situation to your advantage. Once per day when you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can lunge toward your attacker, throwing it off-balance. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on all melee attack rolls until the beginning of its next turn. You can use this ability a second time each day when your base attack bonus reaches +4, and an additional time per day for every 4 points of bonus you accrue thereafter.",
			"Versatile Armor (Combat Expertise): You can adjust how you present yourself and maneuver in your armor to maximize your speed and mobility or to maximize your defenses. While using your armor for speed, your movement is not affected by your armor and its armor check penalty and armor bonus to AC both decrease by 2. While using your armor for defense, your armor's check penalty increases by 3 and its armor bonus to AC increases by 1. Adjusting how you use your armor is a move action, and the adjustment remains until you change it, take off your armor, or lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).",

Shoddy items are sold for the same price as their well-made counterparts. Manufacturing a shoddy item requires the Craft Shoddy Item feat (see above) in order to successfully conceal the poor workmanship. Shoddy items are never masterwork or made of special materials (though they might appear to be made of a special material), and single-use items can never be made as shoddy items.",

Items other than weapons and armor have a 10% chance to gain the broken condition with each day of use, and if they have a limited number of uses, they have half as many uses as normal. In either case, shoddy items that gain the broken condition can never have that condition removed (even by using magic or if they later recover hit points) without further successful Craft checks and gp expenditure to fix the initial flaws. Shoddy items that are destroyed cannot be recovered by any means, and are useless for anything more than salvaging some of the raw materials.

The primary spell must be an offensive spell that targets an area or one or more creatures. The secondary spell can be any spell with an appropriate descriptor. Neither spell can take more than a standard action to cast. The primary spell behaves as written (with the exception of the synergistic benefits that are described below). The secondary spell does not manifest any of its usual effects; instead, targeted creatures are affected by a secondary effect that is determined by the combination of the two spells' descriptors.",

Regardless, the secondary effects of two spells combined through Elemental Commixture cannot be counterspelled.

			"Synergistic Benefits: The primary spell's save DC (if any) increases by 1.

The caster of the primary spell also gains a +1 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance.",

			"Capture Weapon (Improved Disarm): When you successfully disarm an opponent's manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a -4 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM's discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard.",
			"Find the Hidden (Blind-Fight): You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a -2 penalty and no miss chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn).",
			"Grab Purchase (Climb 5 ranks): You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn.",

			"Steer Opponent (Improved Bull Rush): You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn.",
			"Tangle Leg (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent's legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone.

Creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you play an instrument take a -2 penalty on Perception checks, other than Perception checks made in response to your actions, for as long as you play.",
			"Goad Animal (Handle Animal 5 ranks or Animal Affinity): You can use your soothing performance to handle an animal that is friendly toward you, such as a mount or pet. When playing your instrument, commanding the animal to perform a trick it knows is a free action, and pushing it to perform a trick it does not know is a standard action. If you already can make an animal respond more quickly, such as with the link ability of an animal companion, this trick provides no benefit.",
			"Jaw-Dropping Distraction (Perform 7 ranks, Bluff 7 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): When using your instrument, you can attempt a Perform check instead of a Bluff check to feint an opponent. If you succeed, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against one target of your choosing (other than you) until the beginning of your next turn. Once you have used this trick against a creature, whether or not you succeeded at the check, you cannot use this trick to feint the creature for 24 hours. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to this trick.",
			"Play to the Crowd (Perform 3 ranks, Diplomacy 3 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): You can use Perform, rather than Diplomacy, to improve an NPC's initial attitude toward you as long as you are able to perform for at least 1 minute.

			"Ruffian's Riff (Catch Off-Guard): You can treat a musical instrument as an improvised weapon with the performance special feature.

			"Careful Steps (Nimble Moves or Acrobatics 5 ranks): You can pass through a square splashed with Kaava musk without getting any of it on you.",

			"Make the Kill (scent ability or scent rage power): You gain a +1 morale bonus on weapon attack and weapon damage rolls when attacking a target marked with Kaava musk.",
			"Musk Blinding (Blinding Critical): When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the Fortitude save DC of the blinding critical effect by +5.",
			"Musk Poison (poison use class ability)*: You can apply Kaava musk to a melee or thrown weapon as if it were a poison. This makes your weapon reek in the normal manner. However, the first creature struck by your weapon also gains the musk-stink as if it were splashed by a full container of musk 2 days ago. The struck target can wash off the musk on the next round in the normal manner, but otherwise it continues to stink for 2 more days. Kaava musk applied to small items like ammunition has no effect.",
			"Musk Sickening (Sickening Critical): When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the duration of the sickening critical effect by 1 minute.",
			"Reactive Splashing (Improved Disarm)*: When disarming an opponent of a flask of Kaava musk, you can have the flask break at your opponent's feet, automatically splashing him with the musk.",
			"Splashproof Shield (Shield Focus): If you are using a shield and are hit with Kaava musk, you can make a Reflex save to use the shield to prevent any of the musk from touching you (thus, if you drop the shield, you do not have any of the musk penalties). The DC for this ability is 10 if using a tower shield, 15 for a heavy shield, 20 for a light shield, and 25 for a buckler. You cannot use this trick if you are flat-footed or helpless.",

			"Intensified Oil (Craft [alchemy] 3 ranks): You can combine three flasks of oil into a single use of improved oil as you add it to a lamp or lantern. This improved oil causes the lamp or lantern to which it is added to burn more brightly than usual, increasing its light range by 50%. This improved oil can only be used in the lamp or lantern it's mixed in and has no additional special effects.",

			"Lesser Light (no additional prerequisites): When lighting a lamp or lantern, you reduce the size of its flame to provide only dim light in the area in which the lantern usually provides normal light. The lamp or lantern uses oil at half the usual rate. The lamp or lantern must be extinguished and re-lit to shed light normally.",
			"Oil Splash (Improved Dirty Trick): You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent while either you or the opponent is holding a lamp or lantern.

You can treat an unhinged folding pole as an improvised weapon with the disarm and trip special features. A pole or folding pole used as an improvised weapon deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage.",
			"Seek the Unseen (Perception 1 rank): When you attempt to find a creature you cannot see (either because it is invisible, or because you are blind), you can sweep a pole through any two adjacent squares within 10 feet of you as a standard action. Make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you hit, and if a creature you cannot see is in the designated area, you deal no damage but have successfully pinpointed the creature's current location.",
			"Wall Climb (Climb 3 ranks): You can climb narrow passageways if your pole can reach a wall or other solid surface on both sides, bracing yourself and scooting the pole further along the surface as you climb.

			"Hogtie (Improved Grapple): When you attempt to tie up an opponent you are grappling, your penalty is only -5 instead of the normal -10.",
			"Knotted Weapon (Weapon Proficiency [spiked chain]): You can use a knotted length of rope as a spiked chain that inf licts bludgeoning damage instead of piercing damage.",
			"Lash (Weapon Proficiency [whip]): You can use a length of rope as a whip at no penalty. The piece of rope that is used as a whip must be 10 feet long-length in excess of this must remain coiled or otherwise unused at your feet or side.",
			"Lifeline (Climb 5 ranks): When you or a nearby creature is falling (from a failed Climb check or otherwise), you can throw a held rope as an immediate action, maintaining a grip on one end. If you are falling, this is treated as an attempt to catch yourself while falling made with a +10 bonus, but there must be some sort of solid anchor available for your rope to loop around. When attempting this check on another creature, treat it as if you yourself were falling. If the weight of the creature exceeds twice your heavy load limit (your own equipment does not count against this maximum), you are pulled after it.",
			"Quick Release (no additional prerequisites): You can secure a rope such that you can loose it from either end by making a quick series of tugs (a move action) at any point along the rope's length.",
			"Slip Away (Escape Artist 5 ranks): You gain a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks to escape from ropes and ropelike restraints (such as vines).",
			"Tangle (Throw Anything): You can throw a coiled length of rope as a ranged weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the target becomes entangled. It can cut or burst the rope, or escape with a DC 15 Escape Artist check. The rope must be unsecured to use this trick.",

			"Break Ground (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent's feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach. Whether or not you succeed, as long as your shield remains where you threw it, the opponent treats that square as difficult terrain until he moves out of the square.",
			"Hurl Shield (Throw Anything): You can throw your shield as a ranged improvised weapon. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield to perform this trick. If you are using a throwing shield, there is no reason to use this trick.",
			"Little Wall (Escape Artist 5 ranks): You can contort your body behind your shield in order to gain a brief moment of security. Whenever you use the total defense action, you may choose to gain cover instead of the normal dodge bonus to AC.",
			"Keen Eye (Perception 5 ranks): You have mastered the art of using the reflective surface of your shield to locate foes that you dare not look at directly. On your turn, you may choose to forfeit your shield's AC bonus for 1 round to improve your defenses against one creature using a gaze attack. Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature's gaze attack increases to 100%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack.",
			"Release Shield (no prerequisites): You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield (see page 5) as a free action. Once you've removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action.",
			"Ricochet Shield (Deadly Aim, Throw Anything): When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target.",
			"Shield Gag (Improved Grapple, Throw Anything): You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouthbased abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you both lose the grappled condition, though your shield remains in its mouth. The creature may remove the shield by destroying it (or leaving it with the broken condition), forcing the shield out of its mouth with a grapple check against your CMB, or swallowing it (if it has the swallow whole ability) as if the shield were a creature.",

You gain a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check, and you take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your second turn.",
			"Disarming Lash (Improved Disarm): You can lash out with your sling to ensnare an opponent's weapon and pull it away. When you perform a disarm combat maneuver while wielding a sling, you can use your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to determine your CMB.",
			"Hurl Splash Weapon (Far Shot, Throw Anything): You can fling a splash weapon with your sling to great effect. As a full-round action, you can use your sling to hurl a splash weapon as a ranged touch attack with a range equal to half your sling's range. This trick does not work with an alchemist's bombs.",

When you or an ally within your reach has the bleed condition, as a standard action, you can bind the wound, stopping the bleed damage from one bleed effect; any other bleed effects still deal their bleed damage.",

			"Flare (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks or alchemist bomb class feature): As a standard action, you can expend the remaining life of a sunrod (lit or unlit) in an instant. Sighted creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst of the sunrod must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 2d4 rounds. Creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness receive a -2 penalty on their saving throws. Alternatively, as a full-round action, you can strike a creature with the sunrod or throw the sunrod as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface, it flares as describe above. Since you don't have to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at the corner of particular 5-foot square. Treat the target corner as AC 5. If a creature is struck by the sunrod and fails its Fortitude save, it is blinded for the first round of its dazzled condition.",

			"Like the Sun (ability to cast any spell with the light descriptor): You can use a sunrod as an additional material component for any spell that bears the light descriptor. The spell is treated as one spell level higher (to a maximum of 9th level) for all purposes, including the calculation of saving throw DCs and its ability to overcome sources of magical darkness.",
			"Lodge Sunrod (Throw Anything): You can throw your sunrod as a ranged improvised weapon. If you hit with a ranged touch attack, the sunrod does no damage, but stays lodged on the target until the target or another creature spends a move action to remove it.",
			"Lure (Handle Animal 5 ranks): As a move action while holding a lit sunrod in your hand, you can attempt to move an animal in any direction you desire. Make a Handle Animal check against a DC of 15 + the target animal's CR. If you are successful, the animal moves 5 feet in the desired direction on its next turn. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the animal moves another 5 feet, up to the animal's maximum speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, though if one is taken, the animal immediately stops moving (whether or not the attack hits). You cannot move an animal into an obvious hazard with this trick, but you can (for example) lure it into an open cage.",
			"Twice as Brightly (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks): As full-round action, you can tamper with an unused sunrod such that it burns out in a single hour, but shines much more brightly. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by two steps for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes normal light, and dim light or normal light becomes bright light). It does not increase the light level in bright light.",

			"Dirty Pick (Disable Device 1 rank): You don't take any penalties for using a set of thieves' tools as an improvised melee weapon. A set of thieves' tools used as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of piercing damage. Additionally, when you attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check to impose the blinded condition with a set of thieves' tools, you don't provoke an attack of opportunity. Masterwork thieves' tools grant a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks for these purposes.",
			"Let Myself In (Knowledge [engineering] 3 ranks): Whenever you succeed at a Disable Device check to unlock an object that requires a move action to open, such as a door, you can immediately open that object as a free action instead.",
			"Ranged Chicanery (Disable Device 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, ability to cast mage hand): You can use mage hand to attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks at range. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by an amount equal to 5 + 1 for every 5 feet the range is greater than 25 feet. You can't take 10 or 20 on this check. Any object manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. If you also possess the ranged legerdemain class feature, you no longer increase the skill check DC by 5 while using Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at range.",

Any creature damaged by that spell or bomb must also succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 hour.",
			"Evolve Resilience (Knowledge [arcana] 1 rank, eidolon class feature): Your eidolon can consume a thunderstone as a standard action to bolster its resilience against certain effects. For 1 hour, your eidolon gains the resistance evolution (electricity or sonic only; Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 61 or Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 36). Your eidolon cannot gain both resistances from this trick at the same time. During this time, the eidolon is immune to the effects of thunderstones.",
			"Startling Noise (Stealth 3 ranks or stalker vigilante specialization): Your thunderstones are especially effective when foes don't know they're coming. Any creature that is completely unaware of your presence takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against thunderstones you use and, if deafened, takes an amount of nonlethal damage equal to your number of sneak attack or hidden strike dice (if any).",
			"Thunderclap (Weapon Focus [any hammer]): Your thunderstones enhance the concussive force of hammers you wield. This trick only works with hammers to which your Weapon Focus feat applies. As a move action, you can wedge a thunderstone in place on your hammer's striking surface. When you hit a foe with that hammer, the thunderstone detonates. You gain a +4 bonus on your saving throw against the thunderstone's effect (if necessary), and your foe takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw against the thunderstone's effect.",

You can make this choice at any time during the day, but you must choose the item (and school) before casting the spell.",
			"Counter Dispelling (Spellcraft 3 ranks): When a foe attempts a dispel check, such as via dispel magic, against either a wondrous item that you are currently wearing or wielding or a spell effect created by such an item, you can use your ranks in Use Magic Device as the item's caster level instead of its actual caster level when calculating the dispel check DC. You must be aware of the spell that is being cast and identify it with a successful Spellcraft check in order to receive this benefit.",
			"Favored Item (Magical Aptitude): Once per day, you can spend 1 hour practicing with a wondrous item to designate it as your favored item for that day. If the favored item functions for a specific number of rounds or minutes per day greater than 1 round or 1 minute, you increase the maximum number of rounds or minutes it can function that day by an amount equal to half your ranks in Use Magic Device (minimum 1 round)."

Unless otherwise specified, using any of these abilities consumes one vial of holy water.",

If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Reflex DC 13 negates blindness).

The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is equal to 15 + 2 ?? the number of doses of holy water you are combining. For example, combining three flasks of holy water would require a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) check. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the distillation process failed and must be tried again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the distillation process failed and all of the doses of holy water are wasted. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is equal to half the number of ranks you possess in Craft (alchemy).",

Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage ?? the number of doses of holy water used. For example, a flask of concentrated holy water made of 3 doses of holy water would deal 2d4+6 points of damage on a direct hit, and 4 points of damage to undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of the target.",

When you do so, you must place a spell glyph containing a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or lower, which can be designed to benefit allies or harm undead.",
			"Healing Water (Heal 5 ranks): You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of 1d8 points of damage.",
			"Holy Circle (ability to cast magic circle against evil): You can replace the silver material component of a magic circle against evil spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases 20 minutes per level instead of 10 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20.",
			"Holy Water Splash (Point-Blank Shot): When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water's splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you.

			"***Benefit:*** You may satisfy the material requirement of any spell you cast with valuable coins, gems, or jewelry rather than the normal component. For spells with material components with no listed value, valuables worth 5 times the spell's level in gp may be expended instead of the usual components (5 gp for a 1st-level spell, 20 gp for a 4th-level spell, etc). In the case of spells with components that have a listed cost, you may expend valuables worth a number of gp equal to one and a half times this cost (thus, a spell like ~`commune`~ with material components costing 500 gp could be cast using valuables worth 750 gp). Only coins, gems, jewelry, and other similar objects of obvious worth can be used to replace other material components using this feat. The value of these objects need not match the required cost exactly, but they cannot be less than the required costs. Should valuables of greater value than required be expended (likely when employing objects like gems or jewelry), the extraneous gp value is lost, consumed with the rest of the object. The only exception comes in the case of spells with material components that have a listed worth. When casting such spells you may expend double the components' gp worth in valuables to cast the spell as if your caster level were 1 level higher. This e!ect only applies to spells with components with a specific gp value. Any expenditure beyond double the gp value grants no additional benefit."

You gain a +1 bonus on all Knowledge skills in which you have at least 1 rank.",
			"Vinmark: Newcomers and outsiders, your Ulfen family was exalted to nobility 19 years ago, when Stavian III promoted your family patriarch to Baron of Oppara as a reward for service in the Ulfen Guard. Established aristocrats consider your family crude, choosing to leave them on the margins of Taldan politics unless a noble thinks they could use you to curry favor with the Grand Prince, but hard-won practicality and newborn cynicism grant you insight most Taldan nobles lack. Once per day when rolling a Sense Motive check, you may roll two dice and use the better result.",

Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] ?? 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his empowered enlarged magic missile takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants.

Using Soul-Powered Magic is an evil act.",
			"The Value of Souls",
			"Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul's value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul's life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul's age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul's flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within).",
			"Life Force: A soul's life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested ?? 1,000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature's soul is 1,000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp.",
			"Age: A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp.",
			"Flavor: As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of ~`Desna`~ might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way."

The other spell must be either the same spell level as the stylized spell (before applying the metamagic adjustment) or 1 spell level higher. If you do so, the stylized spell gains the ruse descriptor (see page 192) and takes on some superficial aspects of the other spell. As usual for a spell with the ruse descriptor, identification attempts that fail by 10 or less mistakenly identify it as the chosen spell (those that fail by more can't identify it at all).

Changing an apparent energy descriptor changes the superficial manifestation of the energy in the spell effect but does not change the type of damage the spell deals. If the energy damages any creatures or objects, an observer who succeeds at a DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) or Perception check as a move action can identify the actual type of damage dealt based on sensory clues.",
			"Apparent School: A stylized spell can appear to be of a different school or subschool when studied with detect magic.",
			"Apparent Source of Magic: A stylized spell can appear to be a different type of magic-arcane, divine, or psychic. The effect is convincing only if the spellcaster provides any necessary components (such as a divine focus when imitating divine spells), and the caster must have a number of ranks in the skill associated with that type of magic equal to the spell's level. Knowledge (arcana) and Perform are associated with arcane magic, Knowledge (nature and religion) are associated with divine magic, and Bluff and Knowledge (arcana) are associated with psychic magic. A spellcaster can disguise his spell as psychic magic only if he can hide or remove the spell's verbal and somatic components (if any), such as with Conceal Spell (Ultimate Intrigue 80), Secret Signs (Pathfinder Campaigner Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 288), Silent Spell, or Still Spell.",
			"Direction of Spell's Effect: A stylized spell effect that visibly originates from the caster (such as a ray, magic missile, or fireball bead) can instead appear to originate from another point within 30 feet of the caster. There must be clear lines of effect between each of the caster, the new origin point, and the destination. If the spell effect instead fills an area that originates from the caster (such as a line or cone), the effect can instead appear to originate from any point in that area. The new point of origin is entirely cosmetic, and it does not allow the spellcaster to ignore cover or other barriers. In addition, the deception can't make it appear that another creature cast the spell.",
			"Imitate a Dissimilar Spell: If a stylized spell appears to be of the same school and same source of magic, and to have the same descriptors as another spell because of other stylized spell modifications or changes from other sources (such as a class ability), the stylized spell can take on the superficial visual and auditory properties of the other spell.",
			"Suppress Audible or Visible Effects: A stylized spell's effects can be suppressed to the point where they are difficult to spot or hear. Such a spell's audible and visual effects are largely transparent, quieter, smaller, or otherwise less obtrusive. A creature notices the suppressed effects only if it succeeds at a Perception check (DC = 10 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Spellcraft + the highest of your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma modifiers). If, at the GM's discretion, a spell's effects are intrinsically bound to its visual or auditory signature (such as sunburst, sound burst, and most spells with the language-dependent, light, or sonic descriptors), reduce the DC of the Perception by 10."
