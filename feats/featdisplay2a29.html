Your blows are not only deadly, but debilitating as well.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplay9292.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirty%20Trick">Improved Dirty Trick</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  Whenever you confirm a critical hit, you can also affect the target as if you had succeeded at a dirty trick combat maneuver check. Doing so normally causes the target to suffer for 1 round one of the conditions applied by a dirty trick, unless you have feats or abilities that give you more dirty trick options.

Special:  You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.
