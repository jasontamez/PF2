You gain the ability to summon powerful spiders.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast summon monster or summon nature's ally spells, drow.

Benefit:  When casting either a summon monster spell or a summon nature's ally spell, your options increase. Depending on the level of the spell, you can summon the spiders listed below.

Summon Monster: 1st level-giant crab spider*; 4th level-giant black widow*; 5th level-ogre spider*; 7th level-giant tarantula*
Summon Nature's Ally: 1st level-giant crab spider; 4th level-giant black widow; 5th level-ogre spider; 7th level-giant tarantula

Creatures marked with an asterisk (*) are summoned with the celestial template if you are good, and the fiendish template if you are evil. If you are neutral, you may choose which template to apply to the creature.

Furthermore, when you summon spiders using summon monster or summon nature's ally, the DC of the summoned monster's poison and web effects increases by 2.
