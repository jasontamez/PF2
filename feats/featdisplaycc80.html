You can mislead magic items by virtue of your disguise.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc704.html?ItemName=Deceitful">Deceitful</a>, Disguise 1 rank, Use Magic Device 1 rank.

Benefit: When you are in disguise as a member of a particular race or a person of a particular alignment, you can use your Disguise bonus instead of your Use Magic Device bonus to emulate that race and alignment for the purpose of attempting to activate a magic item.
