You can temporarily customize your own weapons.

Prerequisites: Craft (weapons) 3 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 3 ranks.

Benefit: With an hour of work, you can temporarily add a weapon modification of your choice to your weapon (or temporarily remove an existing modification) at no cost. You must have access to masterwork artisan's tools designed for weaponsmithing to perform this alteration. This alteration lasts for 8 hours. Weapon modifications you add this way only provide their benefits to you; any other wielder treats the weapon as one category more difficult to use than normal, but does not gain its benefits.
