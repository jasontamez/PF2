Heroic Recovery - Feats







Heroic Recovery

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 162</a>
You can throw off the effects of crippling conditions.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc50c.html?ItemName=Diehard">Diehard</a>, <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance</a>, base Fortitude save +4.

Benefit:  Once per day as a standard action you may attempt a new saving throw against a harmful condition or affliction requiring a Fortitude save that is affecting you. If this save against the affliction fails, there is no additional effect, but a successful save counts toward curing an affliction such as poison or disease. You cannot use this feat to recover from instantaneous effects, effects that do not allow a saving throw, or effects that do not require a Fortitude save.

Mythic Heroic Recovery

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 66</a>
You can shrug off the effects of harmful conditions after they've taken effect.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf6af.html?ItemName=Heroic%20Recovery">Heroic Recovery.</a>

Benefit:  As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to use Heroic Recovery additional times. Whenever you do, add your tier to the result of the Fortitude save.
