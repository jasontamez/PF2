Arcane Armor Mastery (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 118</a>
You have mastered the ability to cast spells while wearing armor.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf9fe.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Armor%20Training">Arcane Armor Training</a>, Medium Armor Proficiency, caster level 7th.

Benefit: As a swift action, reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by 20% for any spells you cast this round. This bonus replaces, and does not stack with, the bonus granted by Arcane Armor Training.

When casting a spell while wearing armor, you can spend 1 stamina point to activate Arcane Armor Mastery as a free action, or spend a number of stamina points equal to the spell's level (minimum 1) to ignore your armor's arcane spell failure chance entirely for that casting.
