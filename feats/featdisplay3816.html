By going against traditional teachings and summoner practices, you have secured the service of an outsider whose morality differs wildly from your own, but you must endure its constant temptations or attempts to redeem you.

Prerequisites: Unchained summoner level 1st, eidolon class feature.

Benefit: You can select an eidolon of any alignment, even if its alignment is more than one step away from your own. Your eidolon never refuses your call as a result of the differences between your respective alignments, though it still can refuse to follow commands that are against its ethos or alignment.

Each time you gain a summoner level, you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your eidolon's Hit Dice + your eidolon's Charisma modifier). On a failure, your alignment permanently shifts one step closer to that of your eidolon. Modifiers that are not permanent can't be applied on this saving throw.

Special: If your alignment becomes the same as that of your eidolon, you can immediately replace this feat with any other feat you would have qualified for at 1st level. The feat you choose for this must be one approved by the GM, depending on the nature of your eidolon and its influence over you.
