When you hit with an attack and the roll fails to threaten a critical hit by 3 or less, you can spend 5 stamina points to attempt to deal double damage anyway. Roll as if confirming a critical hit. If this confirmation roll succeeds, your attack is still not a critical hit, but it deals double damage.
