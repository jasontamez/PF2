You have learned to let your armor bear the brunt of the worst attacks.

Prerequisites: Proficient with armor or shield.

Benefit:  If an opponent scores a critical hit against you, you can turn the critical hit into a normal hit. If you do, either your armor or your shield gains the broken condition (your choice).

When you use this feat to negate a critical hit, you can spend 5 stamina points to give your armor or shield a 50% chance to avoid gaining the broken condition.
