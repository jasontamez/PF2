Center of Power

You have posted loyal followers in the most vital places.


Prerequisites: Leadership score 13, hold a leadership
role related to running a kingdom.

Benefit:  Choose a building in your kingdom as
your center of power, and dedicate one of the followers
granted to you by the Leadership feat to overseeing that
location. For every kingdom turn in which that follower
does nothing but oversee that location, the benefits
that building grants to your kingdom's Economy, Fame,
Loyalty, and Stability are doubled and any penalties are
negated. This feat does not allow a building to grant
benefits it does not normally provide, and has no effect
on a building's other effects.

This feat only applies to one building, and committing
multiple followers to this or different buildings has
no effect-the selected location is treated as being
of particular importance to you, and its uniqueness
combined with the follower's loyalty grants it special
efficiencies. The same follower does not have to oversee
your center of power every month, but you must keep at
least one follower dedicated to this location for the entire
month to gain this feat's benefits. Once per year, you may
change which building is your center of power.
