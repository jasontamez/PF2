You use powerful, deadly bursts of speed to charge and attack an additional foe.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplay51d3.html?ItemName=Barracuda%20Slam">Barracuda Slam</a>, <a href="featdisplay993f.html?ItemName=Barracuda%20Style">Barracuda Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, Acrobatics 7 ranks, Swim 7 ranks.

Benefit: You gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. When you attack on a charge in water or on land and the attack hits, you can immediately make a second charge attack against a second opponent. All the normal requirements for making a charge, such as moving at least 10 feet and moving in a straight line, apply to this second attack. The total distance of the two charge attacks cannot exceed the normal maximum distance for a charge (usually double your speed).

The movement, including leaving the first target's threatened area, provokes attacks of opportunity as normally. You cannot use pounce or other abilities that grant extra attacks on your turn if you use Barracuda Dash to make a second attack.
