Your shout heartens your allies and encourages them in the fight.

Prerequisites: Cha 13; base attack bonus +5 or Perform (act, oratory, or sing) 5 ranks.

Benefit: A number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus, you can let out a battle cry as a swift action. When you do, allies within 30 feet who can hear you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

If an ally is under the effect of this feat and fails a saving throw against a fear effect, she can choose to end the battle cry's effect on her to reroll the failed save. The ally must take the result of the reroll, even if it's lower. Each ally can use this effect only once per use of this feat.

You can spend 5 stamina points when an ally under your battle cry's effect decides to reroll a saving throw against a fear effect and end the feat's effect. When you do, that ally continues to be affected by the Battle Cry after she rerolls the saving throw.
