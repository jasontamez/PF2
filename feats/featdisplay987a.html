You can turn the tables on disoriented opponents.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="featdisplay1341.html?ItemName=Improved%20Shield%20Bash">Improved Shield Bash</a>, <a href="featdisplay0207.html?ItemName=Upsetting%20Shield%20Style">Upsetting Shield Style</a>, proficiency with bucklers.

Benefit: While you are using Upsetting Shield Style, if a foe is taking a penalty on attack rolls against you as a result of Upsetting Shield Style, and that foe makes a melee attack roll against you that misses your AC by 5 or more, that foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can only make one attack of opportunity against an opponent in this manner each round.
