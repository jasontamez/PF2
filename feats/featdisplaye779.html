You are granted a small bit of divine power as a result of your veneration of a pantheon of deities.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, must worship a pantheon.

Benefit:  When you take this feat, select a pantheon from the list below. You gain the listed spell-like ability for your selected pantheon, usable once per day. If the granted spell allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier.

Special:  If you act out of line with the tenets of your pantheon's beliefs, you lose the ability to cast the granted spell-like ability until you have received an atonement for your transgression (as a cleric attempting to regain lost class abilities).

Juju Pantheon (Cultural)

Deities wendo (supernatural entities of the spirit world; see Faiths & Philosophies 14)
Common Believers juju practitioners, wendifa
Granted Spell-like Ability speak with animals

Sar-Gorog Pantheon (Aligned and Cultural)

Deities Urgathoa (NE), Rovagug (CE), and Zura (CE)
Common Believers Koboto cannibal tribes of the Sodden Lands
Granted Spell-like Ability decompose corpse; if you use this ability on a corpse rather than on a corporeal undead, you receive nourishment as though you had eaten a normal meal for a Medium creature.

Note: This feat first appeared in Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths & Philosophies as <a href="featdisplaya2d3-2.html?ItemName=Pantheistic%20Blessing">Pantheistic Blessing</a>, but is corrected and expanded here to include a benefit for juju practitioners and worshipers of Sar-Gorog.
