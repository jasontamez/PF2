You learn to ram the whole weight of your body into an opponent to take it by surprise.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplay993f.html?ItemName=Barracuda%20Style">Barracuda Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, Acrobatics 5 ranks, Swim 5 ranks.

Benefit: With a successful Swim check, you can move half your speed as a move action or your full speed as a full-round action. You can run and charge underwater, though the maximum distance you can move while doing so is half the normal maximum distance. Further, while making a charge attack in water or on land, you can add twice your Strength bonus on the damage roll for your first unarmed strike on your turn.

Normal: You cannot charge or run underwater unless you have a swim speed. With an unarmed strike, you usually add your Strength bonus on damage rolls.
