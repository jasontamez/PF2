You induce fear and loathing when you latch onto another living creature.

Prerequisites: Attach universal monster ability.

Benefit: When you use your attach ability, your opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) to avoid becoming shaken while you remain attached. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
