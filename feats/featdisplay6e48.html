Your innate magical darkness seeps through your skin and strengthens when you're near another creature whose soul is as wicked as yours.

Prerequisites: Drow, darkness racial spell-like ability.

Benefit:  Whenever you're adjacent to a drow ally who also has this feat, you can spend a move action to gain concealment (20% miss chance) for 1 round.
