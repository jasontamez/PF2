Bad luck befalls those who dare to cross you.

Prerequisites: Catfolk.

Benefit:  Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can force the opponent who made the attack to reroll it with a -4 penalty. The opponent must take the result of the second attack roll. This is a supernatural ability.

Special:  If you take this feat and don't already have all black fur, your fur turns completely black when you takes this feat.
