Your words of peace ring true and are much more difficult
for others to resist.


Prerequisites: Charisma 13, good alignment.

Benefit:  The DC to resist spells you cast to ensure
peace or force aggressive creatures to become peaceful
increases by +2. This affects spells that dissuade creatures
from aggressive actions without exerting long-term or
absolute control over them, and without leaving them
defenseless. These spells include, but are not limited to,
calm animals, calm emotions, command, compassionate ally,
enthrall, euphoric tranquility, sanctuary, and serenity.
