A lifetime spent shunned by others and eschewing your heritage makes you resistant to efforts to pry inside of your mind.

Prerequisites: Half-elf.

Benefit:  Once per day, when you fail a Will save against an enchantment spell or effect, you may reroll that saving throw, but must take the reroll result even if it's worse.
