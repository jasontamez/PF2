You can grow wings that allow you to fly.

Prerequisites: Character level 5th, tengu.

Benefit:  Once per day, you can sprout a pair of giant black crow's wings, granting you a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). This spell-like ability otherwise functions as beast shape I (though you do not gain any other benefits of that spell) with a caster level equal to your level.
