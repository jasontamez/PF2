Frightful Shape - Feats







Frightful Shape

Your wild shape form strikes fear into your opponents.

Prerequisites: Wis 19, base attack bonus +9, wild shape class feature.

Benefit: When you use wild shape, it is supernaturally ferocious and disquieting in appearance, such that when you attack a creature, you can use this ferocity to frighten observers. Opponents within 30 feet of you when you attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier) to resist being affected by your frightful shape. On a failed save, creatures with fewer Hit Dice than you become shaken, or panicked if they have 4 Hit Dice or fewer; in either case, the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level. An opponent that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your frightful shape for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
