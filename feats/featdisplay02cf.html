You know how to use batons, clubs, and sticks in new ways.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: When fighting with a club, quarterstaff, dan bong, sap, or tonfa with which you are proficient, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls as though it were a masterwork weapon. If the weapon actually is a masterwork weapon, it instead counts as having the blocking, disarm, distracting, performance, and trip special weapon qualities, even if the weapon normally doesn't have them.
