You distill your channeled energy into a sheen of force that surrounds your weapon for a limited time.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast at least one force spell, channel energy class feature.

Benefit:  A swift action, you can expend one use of channel energy to grant your weapon attacks a bonus on damage rolls equal to the number of dice of your channel energy. This extra damage is force damage. This lasts for your next three weapon attacks or until the end of combat, whichever comes first.

When you hit with an attack while using this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points to not have that attack count as one of the three attacks you can make with the force-imbued weapon.
