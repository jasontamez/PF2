The fiendish blood that courses through your body causes your wounds to heal faster than usual.

Prerequisites: Con 15, <a href="featdisplayc50c.html?ItemName=Diehard">Diehard</a>, <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance</a>, tiefling.

Benefit:  When you regain hit points by resting, you heal double the normal amount of damage. This feat does not stack with items or effects that also affect the amount of damage you recover from while resting. This feat only functions with a full night's rest; complete bed rest is not affected by this feat.
