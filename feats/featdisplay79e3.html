With practiced gestures, you buy enough time to prepare yourself for an inevitable battle.

Prerequisites: Diplomacy 3 ranks, human (Keleshite).

Benefit:  Whenever you're adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can perform a quick, seemingly courteous gesture when you make an initiative check. As part of the gesture, you can perform a single free action, such as dropping an item or entering rage. This feat can be used only when combat breaks out after a conversation, such as from failed negotiations.
