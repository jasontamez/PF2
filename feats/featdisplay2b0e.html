The Three have seen your offerings and proclaimed them satisfactory, even before you actually had the chance to show those offerings to them.

Prerequisites: Fey creature type or <a href="featdisplay187c.html?ItemName=Fey%20Obedience">Fey Obedience</a> (Magdh), you must have collected three gifts worth at least 100 gp each from three different planes across the Great Beyond. At least two of the planes must be diametrically opposed to one another in terms of planar traits.

Benefit: Three times per day as an immediate action, when you are about to roll for an attack, saving throw, or skill check, you can roll three d20s and use the middle of the three results. This ability cannot be combined with other effects that involve rerolling dice or involve rolling twice and taking either the higher or lower result.
