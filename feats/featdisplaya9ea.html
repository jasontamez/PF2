The true motives of creatures cannot escape your discerning gaze.

Prerequisites: Detect alignment class feature, caster level 6th.

Benefit:  When using your detect alignment class feature, you may spend 3 rounds studying a creature within 60 feet. You cannot take any other actions while doing this. After that time has passed, you learn the alignment of the creature.
