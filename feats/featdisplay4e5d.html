You have a natural affinity for coven magic.

Prerequisites: Cha 11, changeling.

Benefit: You can join a changeling coven even if you are not a witch with the coven hex. Your effective witch level is equal to half your character level. A changeling coven must still include at least one changeling witch who has the coven hex.

Additionally, select a single a 0-level spell drawn from the witch's spell list. You gain the ability to cast this spell three times per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. The save DC for this spell is 10 + your Intelligence modifier.
