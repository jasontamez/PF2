You can change your venom to poison those it touches.

Prerequisites: Toxic racial trait, vishkanya.

Benefit: As a swift action when applying your venom to a weapon or object, you can alter it to become a contact poison for 1d4 rounds. In its contact form, your venom has an onset time of 1 minute, and remains indistinguishable from your saliva or blood.

In addition, you can use your toxic racial trait one additional time per day.

Normal: Vishkanya venom is an injury poison.
