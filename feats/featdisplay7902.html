Your ally's charge exposes an opening you can exploit.

Benefit:  When your ally with this feat uses the charge action and hits, you gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target of that charge. This bonus must be used before your ally's next turn, or it is lost.

You can spend 1 stamina point when an ally with this feat charges but misses with the charge attack. When you do, you can still gain the benefit of this feat when you charge.
