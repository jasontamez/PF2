You fight with seamless grace alongside your allies, complementing the inherent strengths of your weaponry.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, Sense Motive 3 ranks.

Benefit: When adjacent to an ally with this feat who is wielding a weapon with the blocking, disarm, distracting, or trip weapon special feature, you can treat your own weapon as if it also had that feature. If your ally's weapon has more than one of those features, you choose one feature to emulate at the start of your turn.
