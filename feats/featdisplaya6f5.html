Focused Target - Feats







Focused Target (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s7z">Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 5</a>
You pour your entire focus into slaying your chosen target.

Prerequisites: Studied target class feature (second studied target).

Benefit: When you study a target, you can reduce the number of additional targets you can maintain as a studied target. For each target reduced in this way, you increase your studied target bonus by 1 for either attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, or the DCs of your abilities. Each such increase must be applied to a different category (attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, or DCs). You can end the effects of this feat as a free action.
