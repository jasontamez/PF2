Your spell-like ability clings to affected targets and interferes with their spellcasting.

Prerequisites: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

Benefit: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a disruptive spell-like ability up to three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

For 1 round after you use a disruptive spell-like ability, affected targets attempting to cast as spell must attempt concentration checks when casting spells or use spell-like abilities (DC = the disruptive spell-like ability's DC + the level of the spell the target is casting or spell-like ability it's using). Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects also avoid this feat's effect.

You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
