Your faith in <a href="deitydisplay5b20.html?ItemName=Sarenrae">Sarenrae</a> and the power of flame allows you to lace fire with holy power and burn things that normally can't be burned.

Prerequisites: <a href="racesdisplay7cda.html?ItemName=Goblin">Goblin</a>, worshipper of <DEITIES%SARENRAE">Sarenrae</a>.

Benefit: Whenever you make an attack or cast a spell that deals fire damage, the fire damage applies to incorporeal creatures, regardless of whether the fire is magical. An incorporeal creature's 50% reduction in damage from corporeal sources does not apply to any fire damage that you deal.
