You distract a mark with friendly conversation while your partner robs the victim blind.

Prerequisites: Bluff 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank.

Benefit:  Whenever an ally with this feat succeeds a Bluff check to feint an opponent, if you are adjacent to that creature, you can spend an immediate action to make a Sleight of Hand check to pickpocket that opponent and gain a +4 bonus on that attempt.
