Nemesis (Story)

A past enemy seeks your ruin.


Prerequisites: You must have at least one enemy who
wishes to cause you great harm. If you have multiple
enemies, the GM may keep the specific nemesis secret, or have many of your enemies work together against you.
If your nemesis is not already a challenging foe, it either advances in strength to become a challenging foe or allies
with others to achieve a higher challenge rating.

Benefit:  Having a nemesis drives you to excel in training.
For each new level you gain in a favored class, including the
level you gained when you chose this feat, you can choose
two benefits instead of one. One of these benefits must be
either a bonus hit point or a bonus skill point, even if other
options are available.


Goal:  Slay your nemesis. Causing your nemesis's death
through your direct actions qualifies even if you do not
strike the fatal blow, but another killing your nemesis
without your involvement doesn't count.


Completion Benefit:  You gain a +2 inherent bonus
to an ability score of your choice. In addition, you may
retroactively apply your extra favored class benefit to the
favored class levels you gained before taking this feat.


Special: Thwarting your plans becomes an all-consuming
goal for your nemesis. Your nemesis gains a +2 bonus on
attack rolls and damage rolls against you. Whatever you try
to achieve, your nemesis seeks to tear down.
