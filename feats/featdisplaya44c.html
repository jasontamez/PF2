Liberator (Story)

Your time in shackles has forever marked your soul.

Prerequisites: You must have been enslaved for at
least 6 months, or have the Imprisoned or Kidnapped
background (see Ultimate Campaign).

Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, weapon
damage rolls, and skill checks when your actions would
directly lead to freeing prisoners or slaves.

Goal: Free at least 200 slaves through perilous rescues
(not merely buying them at market).

Completion Benefit: You gain the ability to inspire
others through your dedication to your cause. Allies
within 20 feet receive your Liberator feat bonuses when
working with you to free prisoners or slaves. In addition,
as a standard action you can inspire slaves and former
slaves within 120 feet, giving them temporary hit points
equal to 1/2 your character level and a +1 bonus on
saving throws. These benefits last for 1 hour, and a given
creature can receive this benefit only
once per day. These are mind-affecting
effects, and the inspiring bonus is
language-dependent.


Suggested Traits: Reactionary, Secret-Keeper, Supportive.
