When you break a grapple, you can send your assailants flying away from you.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Str 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit:  When you succeed at a combat maneuver check to break a grapple, you can choose to throw back any enemies participating in the grapple who are up to one size category larger than you. Such foes are thrown 5 feet directly away from you and take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to that of your unarmed attack.
