After years of practice, cautious experiments, or sheer stubbornness, you have gained the ability to teach unintelligent plant creatures to follow simple commands.

Prerequisites: Handle Animal 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks.

Benefit:  A character with this feat treats creatures of the plant type with Intelligence scores of 3 or lower as animals for the purposes of the Handle Animal skill. Plant creatures without an Intelligence score are treated as animals with an Intelligence of 1 for these purposes. Ordinary plants lack Wisdom and Charisma scores-they aren't creatures and can't be trained.
