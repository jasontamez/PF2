Your purity always remains a blessing, even when you're
surrounded by creatures that despise it.


Prerequisites: 5 or more Hit Dice, good alignment.

Benefit:  You can alter the essence of your being to lessen
the effects of spells designed to harm good creatures.
When affected by spells and effects that behave differently
according to alignment (such as unholy word or protection
from good), you can choose whether you are considered
good or neutral. This ability does not actually change your
alignment or fool divinations, nor does it permit you to
overcome alignment requirements for the use of magic
items, class abilities, and so on.
