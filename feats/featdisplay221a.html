You move an opponent and use his momentum to send him reeling across the battlefield.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Reposition">Improved Reposition</a>, base attack bonus +3 or <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">monk level 1st</a>.

Benefit: When you successfully reposition an opponent, its movement need not remain within your reach, though once the opponent leaves your reach, its remaining movement must be in a straight line. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity unless you have the <a href="featdisplay4072.html?ItemName=Greater%20Reposition">Greater Reposition</a> feat.

Normal: The target of a reposition combat maneuver must remain within your reach at all times during its movement, except for the final 5 feet of movement, which can be to a space adjacent to your reach.
