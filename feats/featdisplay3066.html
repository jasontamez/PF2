Your magic knows the pathways of the mind, and you have become so skilled at casting a certain mind-affecting spell that you can cast it as a spell-like ability.

Prerequisites: Successfully affect 25 different targets with charm or compulsion spells.

Benefit: Choose any one charm or compulsion spell you can cast. You can use this spell once per day as a spell-like ability. Your caster level and DC for this spell-like ability is the same as if you were casting the spell. Each time you gain a level in a spellcasting class, you may replace your current charm or compulsion spell-like ability with a new one.
