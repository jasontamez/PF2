The magistrates of death can breathe death and decay. You were in the presence of a final judge once and your soul remembers that moment still.

Prerequisites: Channel energy 5d6, <a href="racesdisplay41f7.html?ItemName=Duskwalker">duskwalker</a>, ghost hunter racial trait.

Benefit: When you channel positive energy to harm undead, you can expend your ghost hunter racial ability as a free action. Your channeled energy takes the form of spectral beetles and other insectile scavengers, dealing 50% more damage to the undead. You also gain an additional daily use of ghost hunter.
