You're skilled at creeping up on watercraft without being noticed and getting the jump on their occupants.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Swim and Stealth checks while swimming in calm or rough water (but not while swimming in stormy water). In addition, if you're able to act in a surprise round and you start the surprise round in water, you can take both a move and a standard action. You still cannot take a full-round action during the surprise round.

Normal: You can take only a move or a standard action if you can act in the surprise round.
