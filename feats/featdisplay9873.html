You have a special bond with things that creep, crawl, skitter, and sting.

Prerequisites: Wild empathy class feature.

Benefit:  You may target vermin with spells and special abilities that only affect animals (although they are still affected by spells targeting vermin as well). You may use wild empathy to influence vermin as easily as you influence animals.
