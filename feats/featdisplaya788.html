You can draw strength from your woody vines to infuse your flesh with arboreal resilience.

Prerequisites: Con 13, <a href="racesdisplay489d.html?ItemName=Gathlain">gathlain</a>.

Benefit: Once per day as a move action, you can harden your flesh to gain DR 5/slashing for 1 minute. If you have 11 or more Hit Dice, this increases to DR 10/slashing. Additionally, while under this effect, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against paralysis, polymorph, sleep, and stunning effects.
