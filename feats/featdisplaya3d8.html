A client or client family is usually a supplier or local merchant who enjoys the patronage of a merchant house.

Prerequisites: The character must own a business that can supply a single type of good worth 10 gp or more in bulk to a Keleshite merchant house, or a business that can donate a unique rare good (an antique, an object of archeological interest, an artwork, or a magical weapon) of the patron's choice at least once per month.

Benefit: Once per month, a client can choose one of the following: 500 gp, the services of a house guard (human fighter 3; use the statistics for a traitorous brigand from page 81 of the Pathfinder RPG NPC Codex) for 24 hours, or the services of a house emissary who can automatically change the attitude of a ruler or other influential NPC from indifferent to friendly or from friendly to helpful.
