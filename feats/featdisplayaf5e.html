The tip of your weapon pierces both the body and the spirit.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a> with piercing weapon.

Benefit: When you deal damage with a melee attack with a piercing weapon to an opponent you have already damaged this round, you can also reduce the value of that target's spell resistance or energy resistances by 1 until the start of your next turn. This reduction stacks with itself.
