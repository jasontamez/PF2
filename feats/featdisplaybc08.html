You believe that beings can thrive only when free.

Prerequisites: 10 Hit Dice, chaotic good alignment.

Benefit: You can store a number of <a href="rules6336.html?Name=Shifts%20and%20Affirmations&amp;Category=Alignment%20(Unchained)">affirmations</a> up to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to use at any time, not just within the next 24 hours. You can also use an affirmation to gain the effects of <a href="spelldisplayd71b.html?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement">freedom of movement</a> for 1 round. Lastly, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against evil and lawful creatures (or +4 if the creature is both evil and lawful). This is an alignment-based effect.

Residual: If you have this feat but you are no longer chaotic good, you continue to gain the +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against evil and lawful creatures (or +4 if the creature is both lawful and evil).
