Your gaze is naturally drawn to valuable glittering objects.

Prerequisites: Tengu.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks. You may determine the most valuable item in a hoard as a standard action and gain an additional +2 bonus on the Appraise check to do so. In addition, if you fail an Appraise check by 5 or more, you treat the check as if you had failed by less than 5.

Normal:  Determining the most valuable object in a treasure hoard takes 1 full-round action.
