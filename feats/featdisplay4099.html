Step Up and Strike - Feats







Step Up and Strike (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 170</a>
When a foe tries to move away, you can follow and make an attack.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay1802.html?ItemName=Following%20Step">Following Step</a>, <a href="featdisplay1d7f.html?ItemName=Step%20Up">Step Up</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  When using the Step Up or Following Step feats to follow an adjacent foe, you may also make a single melee attack against that foe at your highest base attack bonus. This attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round. Using this feat does not count toward the number of actions you can usually take each round.

Normal:  You can usually only take one standard action and one 5-foot step each round.
