You use your impenetrable luminescence to disorient harbingers of darkness.

Prerequisites: Inner Light, aasimar, daylight spell-like ability.

Benefit:  Whenever an enemy unsuccessfully attempts to counter or dispel your daylight spell-like ability, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier) or become blinded for 1 round as its mind is overwhelmed with celestial light. This is a supernatural mind-affecting effect.
