You brace yourself to catch oncoming foes.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit: As a standard action, you can ready yourself against oncoming foes. Until the start of your next turn, if a creature moves at least 10 feet in your direction and enters a square you threaten, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that creature. If the creature is charging, you gain a +2 bonus on the check. A creature you grapple with this style can make only a single natural attack after its movement or charge, even if it has the pounce ability. You can make only one grapple attempt in this manner per round.
