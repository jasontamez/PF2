As a chosen of the Dawnflower, you are a beacon of hope to the faithful and a bane against the unrepentant.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast divine spells, sandkin half-orc, worshiper of Sarenrae.

Benefit: When casting divine spells in bright light, you can treat your caster level as 1 higher. In addition, your damaging spells with the fire or light descriptor deal one additional point of damage even outside areas of bright light.
