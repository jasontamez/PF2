Your pride allows no master but Asmodeus.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, worshiper of Asmodeus.

Benefit:  Whenever you attempt a Will save against a charm or compulsion spell cast by anyone who is not a worshiper of Asmodeus, you may roll twice and take the better result.
