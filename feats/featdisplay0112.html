A carefully selected set of geodes causes the defenses you create with your spells to offer even better protection.

Benefit: When you cast an abjuration spell using geodes as an esoteric material component, you can grant a single target of that spell a +1 competence bonus on its Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throws for the duration of the spell. The spell must have a duration measured in rounds or minutes, and a creature can benefit from no more than one bonus from this feat at a time.

When you gain geodes' greater component effect with an abjuration spell, treat your caster level as an additional 1 higher for determining the duration.
