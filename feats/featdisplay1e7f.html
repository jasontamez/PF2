You can easily pluck what you need from nature's bounty as you travel.

Prerequisites: Favored terrain class feature.

Benefit: You (and any allies whom you assist with the Survival skill) can move at full speed while using Survival to gather food and water, and you gain a +4 bonus on Survival checks to do so. If you cast create food and drink, create water, or any similar spell that creates edible and potable provisions while you are in your favored terrain, your caster level increases by an amount equal to half your favored terrain bonus.
