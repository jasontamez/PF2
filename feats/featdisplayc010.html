You have learned how to cast spells from behind the safety of a shield.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, base attack bonus +3 or fighter level 1st.

Benefit: You reduce the arcane spell failure of any shield you use by 15% (to a minimum of 0%). Using a shield does not prevent you from completing somatic spell components with the hand wielding the shield.
