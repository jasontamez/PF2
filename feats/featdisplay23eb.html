Benefit: Add half of your shield's enhancement bonus to the shield bonus to AC that you grant to an ally using the Saving Shield feat. While using Vanguard Style, whenever you increase your threatened area with Combat Patrol, your ward retains the bonuses of Vanguard Style as long as he remains within your threatened area, and you can use Bodyguard, Saving Shield, and Vanguard Style whenever an ally that is within this threatened area is the target of an attack.
