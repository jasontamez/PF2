Possess Creature (Monster)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy8b9h">Pathfinder #28: The Infernal Syndrome pg. 57</a>
A fiend gains the ability to merge its physical form with another creature's body, spreading its foul influence from within a living vessel.

Prerequisites: Cha 20, any evil outsider with 10 or more Hit Dice.

Benefit: Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend can discorporate into a malign presence and target a creature within 15 feet. The creature targeted must succeed at a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier or be possessed (see below). Targets under the effects of <a href="spelldisplay435e.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20evil">protection from evil</a>, or related spells, gain a bonus to this save. Should a target succeed at its Will save, the fiend is forced back into its natural form and is stunned for 1 round.

A fiend that successfully possesses a target enters its space and merges with it. While possessing a creature or object, a fiend's body and abilities are unavailable. Once a fiend merges with its target it cannot be harmed until it leaves or is forcibly removed. While possessing a target, a fiend shares the senses of its host and can communicate with it telepathically. A fiend also gains a number of <a href="rules044d.html?Name=Possession%20Actions&amp;Category=Possession">possession points</a> per day equal to its total Hit Dice. These points can be spent to utilize special bodily possession actions detailed on the following pages. A fiend may expend these points as it pleases, with each possession action taking a full-round action.

Each day, the victim of a possession is allowed a new Will save at the original DC to force the possessing fiend to leave its body-objects and areas do not receive daily saves. Should a victim make this save or be killed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in an adjacent space, and is stunned for 1 round. A fiend may not possess a new target for 24 hours after being ejected from a victim. <a href="spelldisplay136a.html?ItemName=Dispel%20evil">Dispel evil</a> (or <a href="spelldisplay4d78.html?ItemName=dispel%20chaos">dispel chaos</a> or <a href="spelldisplay977b.html?ItemName=dispel%20law">dispel law</a>, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. <a href="spelldisplaycdcc.html?ItemName=Banishment">Banishment</a> and <a href="spelldisplayeb0a.html?ItemName=dismissal">dismissal</a> immediately eject a fiend from a target if it fails to save against the spell.
