Finishing Cascade - Feats







Finishing Cascade (Combat, Combination)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 27</a>
Your blows set up your opponents for a devastating finish.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +11 or <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">monk level 11th</a>; at least one <a href="featsc88e.html?Category=Combination">combination feat</a>.

Benefit: The first time in a round you use a <a href="featsc88e.html?Category=Combination">combination feat</a> to apply a reduction or penalty to yourself or an enemy, you can double the feat's numerical modifier. For example, you can double the reduction granted by <a href="featdisplayd2c0.html?ItemName=Combat%20Rhythm">Combat Rhythm</a> to -2. This does not double any other effects of combination feats, such as damage.
