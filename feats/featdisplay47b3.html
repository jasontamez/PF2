Tripping Strike (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 173</a>
The force intrinsic to your critical hits can knock your foes down.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip</a>, base attack bonus +9.

Benefit:  Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can trip your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may knock your opponent prone as if from the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop your weapon to avoid being tripped.

Normal:  You must perform a trip combat maneuver to trip an opponent.

Special:  You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.

When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt to trip the target anyway. When you do, reroll the confirmation roll and use it to determine if the trip attempt exceeds the opponent's CMD. This reroll is used only for the trip combat maneuver; it can't cause the critical hit to be conf irmed. You still can't make the attempt if the target is immune to critical hits.
