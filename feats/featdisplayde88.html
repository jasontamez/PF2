The repeated notice and boons of celestials have marked
you as one of their chosen agents.

Prerequisites: You must have had friendly contact with
a good outsider that would qualify as a challenging foe, be a sorcerer with the celestial bloodline, or have direct
celestial ancestry (such as by being an aasimar).

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based
checks involving good-aligned outsiders and a +1 bonus
to the DC of spells and spell-like abilities you use against
such creatures. You take a -2 penalty on Charisma-based
checks involving evil-aligned outsiders.

Goal: Thwart or decisively defeat an evil creature that
qualifies as a challenging foe, but show mercy and then
convert that creature toward good.

Completion Benefit: You gain the benefit of protection
from evil as a constant spell-like ability. In addition,
you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks against evilaligned
outsiders.


Suggested Traits: Indomitable Faith, Inspiring, Memorable.


Possible Blessed Quests


<table class="inner"><tr><td>d8</td><td>Quest</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>The more pacifistic priests of Sarenrae in Qadira are
considering the newly arrived White Feather Monks as
potential allies, but they'll doubtlessly need a powerful
emissary to help fuse the two groups (page 151).</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The Hellknight Order of the Nail uses increasingly vicious
methods to "civilize" the Shoanti of the Storval Plateau.
A brave Shoanti thundercaller might be able to sway the
tide of battle between these two groups (pages 18, 266).</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Galt's Red Revolution led many to turn to evil, but
hope for redemption comes from Woodsedge, where
sympathy and moderation hold sway (page 73).</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>You were raised in a strict orphanage dedicated to
Asmodeus during Isger's tumultuous Goblinblood Wars.
Although you resisted indoctrination into the church of
the Prince of Darkness, many did not, and you are likely
their only hope for redemption as long as you can locate
your fallen brethren (page 83).</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>In honor of Andoran's patron celestial, Talmandor, you
use rhetoric and deeds to make revolutionaries out of
collaborators in oppressed lands such as Cheliax, Galt, or
Nidal (page 43).</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>In the Fangwood of Nirmathas, the cursed dryad
Arlantia may yet be redeemed if only she can be
reached (page 140).</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>You hope that by locating the fallen demigoddess
Arazni's missing organs, you can use the powerful relics
to bring the so-called Harlot Queen back to the light
(page 76).</td></tr>
<tr><td>8 </td><td>Tales of the accursed beings that now reside in the
Estrovian Forest of Mendev have ignited within you a
righteous indignation, and you will not rest until the
spirits of the so-called "hernes" who plague the oaks
repent for their indiscretions (page 120).</td></tr></table>
