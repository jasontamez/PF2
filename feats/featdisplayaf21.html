Open Up (Combat, Teamwork)

You pull an opponent's shield, opening your foe up to an unobstructed attack by an ally.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise.</a>

Benefit:  When you successfully use the aid another action to improve the next attack roll against an opponent by an ally who also has this feat, that attack also ignores any Armor Class bonus granted by the opponent's shield. This benefit affects only physical shields, not shield bonuses from spells or other sources.

Special:  If both you and your ally also have the Harrying Partners teamwork feat, all of your ally's attacks made before your next turn ignore the opponent's Armor Class bonus from a shield.
