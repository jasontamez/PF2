You strike at your enemies with both weapons simultaneously.

Prerequisites: Dex 15; <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>; <a href="featdisplaye16d.html?ItemName=Twin%20Fang%20Style">Twin Fang Style</a>; Two- Weapon Fighting; Acrobatics 6 ranks; base attack bonus +6 or monk level 6th.

Benefit: While using Twin Fang Style, when you take an attack action while wielding two daggers or two kama, you can strike with both your primary and off-hand weapons. If you do so, both attacks take a -4 penalty and you apply precision damage and effects that occur when you hit only once, even if you hit with both attacks.
