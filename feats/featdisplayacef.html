Your natural spells are significantly increased, enabling you to feed and heal others.

Prerequisites: Con 15, character level 8th, <a href="racesdisplaya15c.html?ItemName=Ghoran">ghoran</a>, natural magic racial trait.

Benefit: Once per week, you can cast <a href="spelldisplay8706.html?ItemName=heroes%e2%80%99%20feast">heroes' feast</a> as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. If you do so, you lose access to the spells normally granted by the natural magic racial trait for the next 48 hours.
