The pursuit of prey invigorates you. You revel in tracking down and slaying your quarry.

Prerequisites: Survival 1 rank; base attack bonus +4 or track class feature.

Benefit: Once per day, when you succeed at a Survival check to find or follow a creature's tracks, you can designate that creature to be your prize for a number of hours equal to 4 + your ranks in Survival. You gain a +2 morale bonus on Survival checks to follow your prize's tracks and on weapon damage rolls against your prize. If you find and subsequently render your prize dead or helpless, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for a number of hours equal to your ranks in Survival.

Special: An animal companion can choose this feat as if it were an animal feat (Core Rulebook 53).
