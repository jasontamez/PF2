Your performance interweaves with and enriches your ally's skills.

Prerequisites: Bardic performance or raging song.

Benefit:  You can attempt a DC 10 Perform check to aid the Perform check of an ally who also has this feat. If you succeed, your ally gains a +1 bonus for each 5 points of your check result; a check result of 10 grants a +2 bonus, a result of 15 grants a +3 bonus, and so on. If you fail, the discord applies a -5 penalty on your ally's check.

Normal:  Aid another checks grant a +2 bonus.
