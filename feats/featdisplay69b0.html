You wield traditional elven weapons with grace.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf89d.html?ItemName=Elven%20Battle%20Training">Elven Battle Training</a>, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, base attack bonus +1, weapon familiarity racial trait.

Benefit:  While wielding a longsword, a rapier, or any melee weapon that has "elven" in its name, combat maneuver checks attempted with that weapon as attacks of opportunity don't themselves provoke attacks of opportunity.
