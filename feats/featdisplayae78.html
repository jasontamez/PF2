Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 129</a>
You are skilled at riding slurks into battle.

Prerequisites: Kobold.

Benefit:  You are able to control, guide, and communicate with slurks (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 251), as if they understood Draconic. You can also spend a standard action to manipulate the nodules on the slurk's back to activate its slime ability. Both you and the slurk can activate this ability during the same round.
