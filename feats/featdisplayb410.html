You negotiate tiny ledges like a mountain goat.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, dwarf, mountaineer or stability racial trait.

Benefit: You can move at full speed while using Acrobatics to balance on narrow surfaces, and you gain a +4 bonus on Climb checks to catch yourself or another creature while falling. You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause you to fall prone (such as earthquakes). This bonus does not apply to your CMD against bull rush or trip attacks.
