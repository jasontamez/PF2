You sometimes get carried away when encouraging your mount to fight.

Prerequisites: Goblin, Ride 1 rank.

Benefit:  You can choose to take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to grant your mount a +1 bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made with natural weapons. These effects affect you and your mount for 1 round. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, this penalty increases by -1 and the bonus to your mount's attack and damage increases by +1 to a maximum of +5. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll.
