When you fall, you drag others down with you.

Benefit: When a creature causes you to fall prone, such as with an effect or a spell (such as grease) or by succeeding at a combat maneuver to trip you, you can attempt a combat maneuver check as an immediate action to trip an enemy within your melee reach. The target of this combat maneuver need not be the creature that caused you to fall prone. If you do not have the Improved Trip feat or a similar ability, your trip combat maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity from the target as normal.
