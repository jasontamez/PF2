In even the fiercest battles, you risk life and limb to save
your allies.

Prerequisites: You must successfully cast a conjuration
(healing) spell on an ally after being hit by an attack of
opportunity, or have the Battle, Chaplain, or Healed
background.

Benefit: When attempting a concentration check
caused by receiving damage (including ongoing damage),
you reduce the damage taken by 50% for the purposes of
determining the concentration check DC.

Goal: Over time, provoke at least 20 attacks of
opportunity for casting conjuration (healing) spells on
allies. These spells don't have to succeed to count.


Completion Benefit: You automatically succeed at
concentration checks for conjuration (healing) spells
caused by taking damage.
