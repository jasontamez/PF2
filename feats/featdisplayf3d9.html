Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against the hexes, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of hags and witches. In addition, whenever you confirm a critical hit against a hag or a witch, any of your allies affected by a mind-affecting effect from that creature can attempt a new saving throw against the effect as an immediate action.
