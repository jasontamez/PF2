You can disrupt your opponent's connection to its own magical power.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Spellcraft 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 1 rank.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can drain the innate magical ability of a creature you've dealt damage to with a metal weapon since the beginning of your last turn. That creature must succeed at a Will save or be unable to access any spell-like abilities it can use more than once per day, until it is healed of all hit point damage, or up to a maximum duration of 1 minute.

Special: If a shaman or witch uses this blood hex, the target is unable to use any of its spell-like abilities for the hex's duration.
