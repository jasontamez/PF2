Your violent death brings woe to the enemies of your daemon masters.

Prerequisites: Urdefhan.

Benefit:  When you succeed at using your daemonic pact ability and allow your soul to be consumed, the resulting blast's radius increases to 10 feet, and you gain a +2 profane bonus to the DC of the Reflex save victims must attempt to halve this damage.

Normal:  A successful use of the daemonic pact ability deals negative energy damage to creatures in a 5-foot radius.
