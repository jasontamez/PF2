Axiomatic energies flow from the golden dust you shed, harming chaotic beings on contact.

Prerequisites: Aphorite, crystalline dust racial trait, nonchaotic alignment.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can expend 1 round of your crystalline dust ability to coat up to two of your natural weapons or held manufactured weapons in a layer of crystalline dust. The weapons remain coated for 1 round and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to creatures with the chaotic subtype. This extra damage does not stack with other features that add alignment-based damage to weapons, such as the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay10ea.html?ItemName=Axiomatic">axiomatic</a> weapon special ability.
