The haunting sound of sepulchral intonations chills the most stalwart adversary to its very core.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1f84.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirge%20of%20Doom">Improved Dirge of Doom</a>, ability to perform dirge of doom.

Benefit: The effect of your dirge of doom lingers with a target for 2 rounds after the creature leaves the dirge's area of effect. If you use your dirge on a creature that is shaken, it becomes frightened. If you use it on a creature that is frightened, it becomes panicked. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Normal:  Fear effects on a creature end immediately once it leaves the area of dirge of doom. A fear effect cannot be made more extreme by dirge of doom and can be changed only to the frightened condition by the Improved Dirge of Doom feat.
