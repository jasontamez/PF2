When you perform an awesome blow, you fling opponents back farther.

Prerequisites: Str 25, <a href="featdisplay3d6f.html?ItemName=Awesome%20Blow">Awesome Blow</a>, <a href="featdisplay34d3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, size Large or larger.

Benefit:  When you make an awesome blow combat maneuver, for every 5 by which your combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD, you send the target flying 5 additional feet. Furthermore, this movement provokes attacks of opportunity from your allies.
