Your walk, stance, and voice all amplify your status as a Hellknight when you cast spells or use spell-like abilities against opponents.

Prerequisites: Hellknight rank, Hellknight 10 TPA.

Benefit: Whenever you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability from the compulsion, fear, phantasm, or shadow sub-schools, add +1 to the DC of the saving throw against that spell or effect.
