You have been hunted for so long that you have developed resistances to slayers' usual scare tactics.

Prerequisites: Vampire.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on saves made to resist aversions to objects, sounds, and materials appropriate to your vampire type (such as garlic, holy symbols, and mirrors for a moroi). When confronted with such things, you can attempt a saving throw immediately instead of after 1 round.
