Diabolic Humiliation (Combat)

Your humiliating strikes decrease a foe's morale.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, Diabolic Style; Vital Strike; Improved Unarmed Strike or Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +8 or monk level 7th.

Benefit: When you successfully stagger a foe with an unarmed strike using Diabolic Style, the target becomes further humiliated. The target cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 1 minute after being staggered in this way, and for the duration of that minute, any additional staggered effects it suffers from your attacks of opportunity last for 2 rounds rather than 1. The durations of multiple staggered effects administered in this way stack.

Special: A monk of at least 10th level with this feat can select Improved Vital Strike as a monk bonus feat.
