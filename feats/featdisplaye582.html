When you cast divine fire spells, their heat empowers nearby allies.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast divine spells, caster level 5th, worshiper of Sarenrae.

Benefit:  Whenever you cast a divine spell with the fire descriptor, choose a single ally within 30 feet that you can see. That ally heals a number of hit points equal to half your level and gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
