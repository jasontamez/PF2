You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in melee with little fear of reprisal.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay40f9.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Reload">Rapid Reload</a>, <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot.</a>

Benefit:  The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took Rapid Reload no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.

Special:  Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select Crossbow Mastery as a combat style feat.

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, reloading any kind of crossbow no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.
