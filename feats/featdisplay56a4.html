Your accuracy when attacking is both delightfully artistic and chillingly deadly.

Prerequisites: Precise Shot; Weapon Focus; base attack bonus +7; Intimidate 7 ranks; Improved Called Shot, targeted strike swashbuckler deed, or targeting gunslinger deed.

Benefit: Each creature you hit using a called shot (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 193), the targeted strike swashbuckler deed, or the targeting gunslinger deed must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for 1d3 rounds (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier). You must be using this style and attacking with a weapon for which you have Weapon Focus to gain this benefit. This is a fear effect that doesn't stack with itself or with other fear effects. If a creature is already shaken and you make it shaken using this feat, the duration of the shaken condition is merely extended.

If this attack deals damage, you can also have the injury leave a distinctive mark, such as a letter, shape, or other simple symbol. This mark heals naturally and disappears once the target has healed the damage dealt by your attack. As a free action after the attack, you can spend 1 grit point or 1 panache point to make the mark heal as a permanent scar unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier). You gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks to see through the disguises of creatures that bear your mark.
