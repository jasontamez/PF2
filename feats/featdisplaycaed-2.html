Breaking things adds to your power.

Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.

Benefit:  When you are raging and you succeed at a sunder combat maneuver, you regain 1 round of rage. If the sunder attempt causes the object to gain the broken condition, you heal 1 hit point. You can only gain these benefits once per round.

You can spend 2 stamina points to regain 1 round of rage after reducing a foe whose CR is at least half your character level to below 0 hit points, rather than upon successfully sundering a target.
