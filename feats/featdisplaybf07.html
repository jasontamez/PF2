Verdant salts addle your target's mind when properly combined with an enchantment spell.

Benefit: When you cast an enchantment spell using verdant salts as an esoteric material component, one target affected by your spell takes a -2 penalty on your choice of ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, or skill checks for 1 round. If your spell allows a saving throw and the target succeeds at its save, it doesn't take this penalty. A creature can be affected by only one penalty from this feat at a time. This is a mind-affecting effect.

When you gain verdant salts' greater component effect with an enchantment spell, increase the DC by an additional 1.
