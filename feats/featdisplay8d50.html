You and your allies pelt your enemies with a deadly barrage of missiles.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  When an ally who also has this feat makes a ranged attack and hits an opponent within 30 feet of you, you can spend an immediate action to make a single ranged attack against that opponent. Your ranged weapon must be in hand, loaded, and ready to be fired or thrown for you to make the ranged attack.
