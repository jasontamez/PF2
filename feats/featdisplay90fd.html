When you leap to the attack, your blows are like bolts from on high.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplayc1d7.html?ItemName=Janni%20Style">Janni Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay9ed0.html?ItemName=Janni%20Tempest">Janni Tempest</a>, Acrobatics 8 ranks, Perform (dance) 8 ranks.

Benefit:  While using Janni Style, you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. Further, if you jump as part of a charge and make an unarmed strike against the designated opponent, a hit allows you to roll the unarmed strike's damage dice twice and add the results together before adding modifiers (such as from Strength) or extra dice (such as precision-based damage or dice from weapon abilities). The extra damage dice are not multiplied on a successful critical hit.
