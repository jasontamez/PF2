Shield Slam (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 133</a>
In the right position, your shield can be used to send opponents flying.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1341.html?ItemName=Improved%20Shield%20Bash">Improved Shield Bash</a>, <a href="featdisplay87c6.html?ItemName=Shield%20Proficiency">Shield Proficiency</a>, <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: Any opponents hit by your shield bash are also hit with a free bull rush attack, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check (see Combat). This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Opponents who cannot move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked prone after moving the maximum possible distance. You may choose to move with your target if you are able to take a 5-foot step or to spend an action to move this turn.

Instead of attempting a free bull rush when using the Shield Slam feat, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt a disarm, reposition, trip, or sunder combat maneuver. This combat maneuver attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target.

Mythic Shield Slam

Your shield bash produces a powerful kick.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay5226.html?ItemName=Shield%20Slam">Shield Slam.</a>

Benefit:  When using Shield Slam to bull rush, an opponent knocked prone because of an intervening wall or other surface also takes damage from the collision. The damage dealt is equal to 1d6 points per 2 tiers you possess. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to add your tier to your combat maneuver checks when resolving a bull rush made due to Shield Slam.
