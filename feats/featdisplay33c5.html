You can refresh your spell-like abilities by expending spell energy.

Prerequisites: Arcane spellcaster, caster level 4th, serpentfolk.

Benefit:  You can expend two arcane spell slots or prepared spells to cast one of your racial spell-like abilities. The level of each expended spell must be equal to or higher than the sorcerer/wizard spell level of the spell-like ability you want to cast.
