You can spend 5 stamina points to make an attack of opportunity against an opponent at least one size category larger than you if that opponent attempts a combat maneuver check against you. You can perform this attack of opportunity even if your opponent can attempt such combat maneuvers without normally provoking attacks of opportunity. (Dragonslayer's Handbook 25)
