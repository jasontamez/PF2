You commune with a spirit of your choice, and it grants your animal companion or familiar a boon.

Prerequisites: Animal companion class feature or familiar class feature.

Benefit: At the start of the day, you can choose to commune with a single shaman spirit. (Although a shaman would need an hour of preparation, this takes you no time.) Once during the next 24 hours, you can spend a standard action to grant your animal companion or familiar that shaman spirit's spirit animal ability for 1 minute per level in the class that grants your animal companion or familiar.
