Like a dolphin, you can quickly dart at a foe and retreat.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay03e4.html?ItemName=Dolphin%20Style">Dolphin Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, Swim 6 ranks, base attack bonus +6 or monk level 6th.

Benefit: While in Dolphin Style, as a standard action underwater you can move up to half your swim speed, make a single melee attack against a creature within your reach, and then retreat back to your previous position. Your movement and attack don't provoke attacks of opportunity, even if your foe has an ability that allows attacks of opportunity with triggers other than moving out of a threatened area.
