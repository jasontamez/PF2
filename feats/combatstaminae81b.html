When you fail to confirm a critical hit with a melee attack, you can spend 2 stamina points to attempt to sunder the target's weapon anyway. When you do, reroll the confirmation roll and use it to determine if the sunder attempt exceeds the opponent's CMD. This reroll is used only for the sunder combat maneuver; it can't cause the critical hit to be confirmed. You still can't make the attempt if the target is immune to critical hits.
