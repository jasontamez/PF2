You skate across the surface of the earth as if gliding on ice.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, <a href="featdisplayc15b.html?ItemName=Nimble%20Moves">Nimble Moves</a>, ki pool.

Benefit:  If you have at least one ki in your ki pool, when you move you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when leaving the first square of that movement. You can spend 1 ki point to avoid provoking attacks of opportunity during that entire move.
