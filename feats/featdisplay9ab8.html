Baneful Judgment (Combat)

You dole out judgment to a particular foe.

Prerequisites: Bane class feature, judgment class feature, monster lore class feature.

Benefit: You can declare a specialized judgment against a creature as a swift action. When pronouncing this judgment, you attempt a Knowledge check to identify the creature, or refer to your previous result if you've already identified the creature. If you succeed at the check or have already identified the creature, you can spend 1 round of bane and choose one judgment other than the healing judgment. You gain the benefits of this judgment against that creature for only 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which you exceeded the DC to identify the target. Subsequent uses of this judgment do not stack with this ability. A creature cannot be the target of this ability again for 24 hours.
