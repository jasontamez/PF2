Greater Drag (Combat)

Foes that you drag are thrown out of balance.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay3380.html?ItemName=Improved%20Drag">Improved Drag</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to drag a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Drag. Whenever you drag a foe, his movement provokes attacks of opportunity from all of your allies (but not you).

Normal:  Creatures moved by drag do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

When you succeed at a drag combat maneuver check, you can spend 5 stamina points to gain up to 10 feet of movement for your drag. You can use this movement in place of your normal movement, but only to drag an opponent.
