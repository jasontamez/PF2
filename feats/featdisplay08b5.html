Your thorough understanding of acoustics in artificial surroundings allows you to improve the power of your bardic performance.

Prerequisites: Bardic performance class feature, Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks.

Benefit:  While inside an artificial structure, you can spend a free action to make a DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) check when you begin your bardic performance. Success on this check allows you to do one of the following.

Self-Harmonize: By performing over the acoustic reverberations of your performance, you increase the DC of your bardic performance effects +1.

Reverberation: You can choose to have the effect of your current bardic performance continue for 1 round after you cease maintaining it, regardless of why you cease maintaining it. You can still have no more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.

Normal:  A bardic performance lasts only as long as you maintain it.
