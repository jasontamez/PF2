You know how to keep your head down and crawl away undetected by larger foes.

Benefit:  You can crawl at half your normal speed and can take a 5-foot step when crawling. When crawling, you don't provoke attacks of opportunity from opponents that are one or more size categories larger than you.

Normal:  You can crawl 5 feet as a move action, and crawling provokes attacks of opportunity.
