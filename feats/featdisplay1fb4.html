You can channel magical power through your weapon to devastating effect.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay61af.html?ItemName=Arcing%20Weapon">Arcing Weapon</a>, <a href="prestigeclassesdisplay5bd1.html?ItemName=Eldritch%20Knight">diverse training class feature.</a>

Benefit: As a standard action, you can cast a spell with an area of effect and a duration of instantaneous, such as <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>, and release it through your melee weapon as part of a melee attack. This functions as the <a href="classdisplayc319.html?ItemName=Magus">magus spellstrike ability</a>, except the spell damage does not multiply on a critical hit, the spell effect is centered on you, and you are excluded from its effects.
