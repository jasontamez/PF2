You live in dangerous times, and are alert for betrayal or unexpected attack.

Prerequisites: Int 13, trap sense class feature.

Benefit:  You gain a bonus on Perception checks made to determine awareness for the surprise round of combat, and a dodge bonus to AC in any surprise round in which you get to act. These bonuses are equal to the bonus you gain from trap sense.
