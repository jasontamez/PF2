Planar Heritage - Feats

You can trace your ancestry to a type of native outsider, even though you yourself are otherwise fully human.

Prerequisites: Human.

Benefit: Choose one type of native outsider (such as ganzi). You count as both human and that race for any effects related to race. For example, if you choose ganzi, you are considered both a human and a ganzi for the purposes of taking traits, meeting feat prerequisites, determining how spells and magic items affect you, and so on. You must have the requisite physical features to gain certain benefits, as determined by the GM (for example, you cannot gain feats that augment your tail's abilities if you do not actually have a tail).

Special: You cannot select Planar Heritage if you already have an ability or feat (like Racial Heritage) that adjusts your heritage in this way.
