You can curse the eyes of a wounded enemy.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Perception 5 ranks, Use Magic Device 1 rank.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can curse a creature you've dealt damage to since the beginning of your last turn. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or its eyes become milky and its vision is obscured. For 1 round, any target the creature makes a ranged touch attack against gains concealment for the purposes of that attack.

Special: A shaman or witch with this blood hex can use it against any creature she has dealt damage to in the past minute. A shaman or witch can use this blood hex as a standard action.
