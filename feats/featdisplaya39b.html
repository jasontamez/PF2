Whether part of a partnership or an army, you stand head and shoulders above your companions.

Prerequisites: Cha 13; any combat feat; ability to gain an animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or mount.

Benefit:  Your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or mount doesn't count as threatening your opponent for the purposes of feats that require you to be the only character threatening a target. Allies with Hit Dice equal to or less than 1/2 your own Hit Dice don't count as threatening opponents for the purposes of such feats.
