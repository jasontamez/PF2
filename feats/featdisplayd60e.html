You can perform more accurate auguries according to planetary movements in relation to the Cosmic Caravan.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast augury as a spell or spell-like ability.

Benefit:  You can use a cosmogram or star chart as an optional focus component for augury. When you do, the augury can account for consequences up to 1 hour into the future, and your chance of a successful reading increases by 4%. If you also consult a calculating standard orrery or calculating grand orrery, the augury can see up to 1 day into the future and your chance of success increases by 8%.
