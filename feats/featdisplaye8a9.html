Your powers of shapeshifting outstrip your dabbling in the druidic faith.

Prerequisites: Wild shape class feature, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks.

Benefit:  If you are a multiclassed druid, your wild shape ability is calculated as though your druid level were four higher, to a maximum level equal to your character level.

Special:  This feat has no effect if you are not a multiclassed druid.
