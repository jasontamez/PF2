Accursed (Story)

Your curse weighs down your soul like a millstone
around your neck.


Prerequisites: You must carry a curse that can be lifted
only by a quest or similar great undertaking, or have the
Cursed Birth background.

Benefit: You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your
character level, as the curse interferes with all magic.
Unlike most spell resistance, it can't voluntarily be
lowered, though your own spells and magic items still
automatically affect you.


Goal: Your curse is lifted or you are able to purge the
corruption of your fiendish blood (the circumstances of
either vary widely based on the nature of the curse, and are
up to the GM).

Completion Benefit: You lose the spell resistance
described above. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your
character level, but only against harmful enchantment,
necromancy, and transmutation spells and spell-like
abilities-your aura resists further attempts to curse you.
Harmless spells automatically bypass this spell resistance
whether you desire it or not. This spell resistance can be
voluntarily lowered.
