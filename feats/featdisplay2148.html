With swift feet and deadly intent, you finish off your target before anyone sees your blade.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, <a href="featdisplay6916.html?ItemName=Spring%20Attack">Spring Attack</a>, base attack bonus +13.

Benefit: You can move up to half your speed instead of taking a 5-foot step when taking a full-round action to perform a coup de grace. Performing a coup de grace does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

You can use this feat only when wielding a light or onehanded weapon.
