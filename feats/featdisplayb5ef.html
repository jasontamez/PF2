You are adept at hiding within your host.

Prerequisites: Int or Cha 17, ability to cast possession or greater possession.

Benefit:  While possessing another creature, you can hide yourself from divinations and pass through wards such as magic circle against evil or the effects of a forbiddance spell. You must attempt a Will save against the spell (even if it doesn't normally allow a saving throw). If you succeed, the spell treats you as if you were your host (for instance, divinations would reveal only the host's alignment, and forbiddance keyed to the host's alignment wouldn't damage you). If your saving throw fails, the spell functions against you as normal; if the spell normally allows a save, your previous failure doesn't count as a failed save against the spell's normal effects.
