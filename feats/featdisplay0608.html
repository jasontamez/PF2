Once you have even the trace of a creature you're tracking, you can't be thrown off the trail.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Perception)</a>, Perception 3 ranks.

Benefit: You can use Perception (rather than Survival) to follow tracks. After you track a creature using the Perception skill, you gain a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by that creature for 1 hour. If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception, this bonus increases to +4.
