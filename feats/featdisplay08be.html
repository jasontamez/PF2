You can adjust your frightful presence to fill victims' minds with something other than just fear.

Prerequisites: Frightful presence, true dragon.

Benefit: You may make a suggestion to any one opponent affected by your frightful presence each round as a free action. The Will save DC for the suggestion is the same as that for your normal frightful presence ability. An opponent who successfully saves against the suggestion removes the effect of the frightful presence and is immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours.
