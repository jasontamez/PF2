You can use your innate magic to create minor illusions that augment your efforts at trickery and deceit.

Prerequisites: Gnome, gnome magic racial trait.

Benefit:  As long as you have at least one spell-like ability unused from your gnome magic racial trait, you gain a +2 racial bonus on all Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks you make. At 10th level, these bonuses increase to +4.

Special:  This feat counts as the Deceitful feat for the purposes of all prerequisites.
