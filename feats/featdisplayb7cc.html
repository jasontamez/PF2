When you draw a foe's blood in combat, that creature begins to doubt its skills.

Prerequisites: Int 13; Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate 5 ranks.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can diminish the confidence of a creature you've dealt damage to within the last minute. That creature must succeed at a Will save or take a -6 penalty on skill checks for one of the following skills of your choice: Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate. This ability lasts until the subject is healed of all hit point damage, up to a maximum of 1 hour.

Special: A shaman or witch with this blood hex can use it as a standard action. Additionally, if a shaman or witch uses this blood hex, the target takes the penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.
