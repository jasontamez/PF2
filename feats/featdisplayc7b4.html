Painful Collision (Combat)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 24</a>
You shove your opponents into each other, causing painful and damaging collisions.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay34d3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>.

Benefit: When you bull rush an enemy into another creature, both creatures take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 5 feet your original target has moved as a result of your bull rush. For instance, if you successfully bull rush a goblin 10 feet and it then collides with another goblin, both creatures would take 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage.
