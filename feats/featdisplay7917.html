Your helm turns aside lethal blows.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay9a03.html?ItemName=Dented%20Helm">Dented Helm</a>, <a href="featdisplayac9b.html?ItemName=Hard-Headed">Hard-Headed</a>, base attack bonus +11, dwarf.

Benefit: When wearing a helmet, you add +1 to your AC against critical hit confirmation rolls; this benefit stacks with Dented Helm. When you use Dented Helm to deflect a critical hit, you may apply all damage from the critical hit to your helmet before applying any damage to yourself. If you take no damage, any additional effects, such as critical feats or poison, are negated.

When you are threatened with a critical hit, you can spend up to 5 stamina points. You gain an additional bonus to AC against the critical confirmation roll equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
