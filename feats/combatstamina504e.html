You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. You can spend 2 stamina points to change an attack that does not have your highest base attack bonus into a dirty trick combat maneuver. You can use this combat trick only once per round, but you can use it even if you already used your attack at the highest base attack bonus for a dirty trick.
