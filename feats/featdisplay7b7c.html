Your knowledge of your enemies' vulnerable spots is especially punishing.

Prerequisites: Sneak attack +6d6, <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a>, any critical feat, base attack bonus +9.

Benefit: Whenever you successfully sneak attack an opponent for a second time on your turn, you can spend a swift action to apply the effects of one critical feat you know to that opponent.
