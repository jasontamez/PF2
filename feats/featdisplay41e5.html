You dart through the press of battle like a breeze, assaulting foes as you pass.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, <a href="featdisplayc15b.html?ItemName=Nimble%20Moves">Nimble Moves</a>, <a href="featdisplay6916.html?ItemName=Spring%20Attack">Spring Attack</a>, base attack bonus +9.

Benefit: When you use Spring Attack, you can select two targets to attack during your movement instead of one. The second attack made this way is made at your full base attack bonus - 5. All restrictions of Spring Attack apply to both targets, and your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity from either target. You can't target the same creature twice.

Special: A monk of at least 14th level can select this feat as a monk bonus feat, but only if he has Spring Attack.
