Your fury in combat translates into crowd-pleasing displays.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +3.

Benefit:  You can apply your Strength modifier instead of your Charisma modifier to performance combat checks.

In addition, when you spend a swift action to attempt a performance combat check that was triggered by a successful bull rush or sunder combat maneuver check, you gain a +2 bonus on the performance combat check. For every 5 points by which your attack exceeded your opponent's CMD, this bonus increases by 2.
