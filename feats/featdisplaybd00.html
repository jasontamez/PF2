You've learned to channel your hatred of a particular type of creature into a devastating strike.

Prerequisites: Studied target class feature.

Benefit: Select a creature type from the Ranger Favored Enemies table (Core Rulebook 64). When you designate a creature of this type as your studied target and hit it with a melee or ranged weapon attack, your favored target bonus on damage rolls against it is doubled.
