When you antagonize your foes, you can redirect their enmity to your ally.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1c38.html?ItemName=Antagonize">Antagonize.</a>

Benefit: When you succeed at a skill check using Antagonize, you can cause the target creature to focus its efforts on a willing ally who also has this feat, as if the ally had been the one to use the ability.
