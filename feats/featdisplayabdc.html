Embrace of the Dark Fey (Story)

The blood of an evil fey ancestor in your veins lends you aggressive, often bloodthirsty impulses that you strive to keep under control.

Prerequisites: You must have an evil fey such as a quickling or redcap somewhere in your family line, or you must have the Shameful Heritage background (Ultimate Campaign 40).

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits.

Goal: Demoralize an appropriate number of creatures using the Intimidate skill.

Special: While a creature is shaken because you have demoralized it using the Intimidate skill, your attacks that deal damage to the creature also deal 1 point of bleed damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself.
