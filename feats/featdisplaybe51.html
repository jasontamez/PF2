Your ability to possess foes can bypass magical protections.

Prerequisites: Magic jar as a known spell or spell-like ability, Cha 21

Benefit:  The first time you attempt to possess a host under the effect of protection from evil spell or any similar spell, you have a chance to dispel that spell as if you had cast dispel magic on the spell.
