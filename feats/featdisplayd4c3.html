Feral Heart (Story)

In your chest beasts the heart of a wild beast.


Prerequisites: You must have reverted to savage behavior
through a traumatic event or extended period in the
wilderness, or have the Raised by Beasts background.

Benefit:  Whenever you receive a morale bonus on Strength
or attack rolls (such as from heroism or the barbarian rage
class feature), you receive a +2 bonus on Dexterity- and
Strength-based ability and skill checks and a +1 bonus on
Ref lex saves until the morale bonus effect ends.


Goal:  Woo and then marry or otherwise enter into a
committed relationship with a person from a civilized
culture. This relationship must be forged in love, not
bought or coerced.


Completion Benefit:  Delay the penalties for the
exhausted, fatigued, shaken, and sickened conditions for
1 round after first receiving them. If you already have the
condition in question and it is applied again, this feat
provides no benefit. Despite ignoring the penalties you
do still have the condition. For example, if you become
shaken again while benefiting from this feat, you become
frightened as normal.
