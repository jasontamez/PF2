You are quite skilled at forcing a possessing creature from its host.

Benefit: Whenever you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability or supernatural ability that allows a creature that is being possessed by another creature to attempt a new saving throw to end the spell or effect (such as protection from evil), the possessed creature can roll the new saving throw twice and take the better of the two results as the actual result.
