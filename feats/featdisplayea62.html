Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 173</a>
You are not only skilled at controlling a horse in combat; you can make it look like art.

Prerequisites: Ride 9 ranks, <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat.</a>

Benefit:  While wearing light or no armor, you do not need to make Ride skill checks for any task listed in the Ride skill with a DC of 15 or lower. You do not take a -5 penalty for riding a mount bareback. You can make a check using Mounted Combat to negate a hit on your mount twice per round instead of just once.
