The mindless undead you command fight together like seasoned warriors.

Prerequisites: Any teamwork feat, ability to control or create undead.

Benefit:  When you create undead, they gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat, though they gain its benefits only when cooperating with you or with other undead that you have created. If you control undead with the Command Undead feat or a spell like command undead, they likewise gain one teamwork feat you know as a bonus feat as long as they remain under your control. Intelligent undead gain no benefit from this feat.
