Your mastery over your ability to transform into an animal allows you to meld two of your major forms into one.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb0a1.html?ItemName=Chimeric%20Adept">Chimeric Adept</a>, <a href="classdisplay92ef.html?ItemName=Shifter">greater chimeric aspect class feature</a>, wild shape class feature.

Benefit: When you transform using the wild shape ability, you can gain the benefits of a second major form of another of your aspects. This additional major form grants you all of the abilities it would normally grant, except for any natural attacks, new movement types, or bonuses to movement. When using wild shape to gain two major forms in this way, you do not gain the minor form granted by the <a href="featdisplayb0a1.html?ItemName=Chimeric%20Adept">Chimeric Adept</a> feat.
