Your attacks can prevent winged opponents from flying.


Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +9.

Benefit:  Whenever you confirm a critical hit against an
opponent that uses wings to fly, you can forgo the extra
critical damage to instead prevent it from flying for a
number of rounds equal to twice the critical multiplier of
your attack. Opponents that are flying at the time of the
critical effect must succeed at a DC 20 Fly check to avoid
taking falling damage.
