When you charge with an ally, you are more deadly.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1, half-orc or orc.

Benefit:  When charging during the same round as an ally with this feat, you gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls in addition to the normal bonus for charging. If you can make multiple attacks on a charge, this bonus only applies to the first attack.
