You can forgo an obvious counterstrike against an opponent to better spot breaches in its defenses.

Prerequisites: Bluff 5 ranks, Sense Motive 5 ranks, opportune parry and riposte deed.

Benefit: When you use the opportune parry and riposte deed to successfully parry an opponent's attack, if you have your immediate action available and choose not to attempt a riposte, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC and a +2 bonus on all combat maneuver checks against the opponent you successfully parried for 1 round.
