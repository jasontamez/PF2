You protect your allies from harm, even at the cost of your own safety.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>; <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>; base attack bonus +2 or monk level 1st.

Benefit: While using this style, as a move action, you can protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you currently threaten. This grants adjacent allies a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent's next melee attack (as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn), but causes you to take a -2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus against the designated opponent's attacks persists even if your allies move away from you.
