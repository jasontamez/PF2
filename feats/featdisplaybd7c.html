You reach the pinnacle of your wilding strike abilities.

Prerequisites: Str 18, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay9188.html?ItemName=Improved%20Wilding%20Strike">Improved Wilding Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay29b3.html?ItemName=Wilding">Wilding</a>, <a href="featdisplay5997.html?ItemName=Wilding%20Strike">Wilding Strike</a>, base attack bonus +16.

Benefit: The damage die of your unarmed strikes increases to 1d10 (or 1d8 if you are Small). This does not stack with any other effects that increase the damage die of your unarmed strikes, including levels in classes such as monk. Increases to your actual size category (such as enlarge person) still increase your damage die as normal.
