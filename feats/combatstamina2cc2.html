You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When attempting a steal combat maneuver with a whip, you can spend 2 stamina points to negate the -4 penalty on the check.
