With a mighty killing blow, your unsettling punch vaporizes your foe.

Prerequisites: Wis 19, Cha 15, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplayf212.html?ItemName=Maddening%20Strike">Maddening Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaye387.html?ItemName=Maddening%20Style">Maddening Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist</a>, Knowledge (arcana) 10 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.

Benefit: When you damage a living creature with an unarmed strike while using Maddening Style, and you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, that creature suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws against any confusion, madness, and insanity effects (including your Maddening Strike) for 1 round. Additionally, if you reduce a creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a Stunning Fist attack, you can spend 2 points from your ki pool as a free action to obliterate your opponent, reducing their body to fine dust as per disintegrate. A living creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) to negate this effect.
