You can draw raw magical energy from the ground to empower your spells.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast 1st-level spells, favored terrain class feature.

Benefit: While you're in your favored terrain, your effective caster level increases by 1 for the purpose of improving spell effects dependent on caster level. This increase in effective caster level doesn't grant you access to more spells.
