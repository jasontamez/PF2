Your wrath is as potent a barrier as your blades.

Prerequisites: Intimidate 5 ranks, Ulfen Guard TPA 20.

Benefit: Choose an adjacent ally as a free action on your turn. Once per round, when an opponent attacks that ally, you may make an Intimidate check to demoralize the opponent as an immediate action. This action counts as an attack of opportunity.
