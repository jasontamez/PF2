The truth has been revealed, and you have been chosen
to deliver it.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast divine spells, and you
must either have received a vision from your god (or
another appropriate supernatural entity) or have the
Marked by the Gods background (see Ultimate Campaign).

Benefit: If you are nonevil and worship a nonevil deity,
whenever you cast a beneficial spell on an ally you gain a
+1 sacred bonus to AC for 1 round per spell level. If you are
evil or worship an evil deity, whenever you cast a harmful
spell on an enemy you gain a +1 profane bonus to AC for 1
round per spell level. Casting a spell on yourself does not
count unless it also affects an ally.

Goal: Convert an appropriate number of creatures to
the worship of your deity.

Completion Benefit: Your bonus to AC for casting
beneficial or harmful spells on allies increases to +2,
and the bonus also applies on saving throws for the same
duration.


Suggested Traits: Called, Ease of Faith, Mystery Initiate.
