Double Bane

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 98</a>
You extend your bane effect to two weapons.

Prerequisites: Bane class feature, <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting.</a>

Benefit:  You can apply your bane to a second weapon you are wielding. While your bane class feature is active, at the start of each of your turns as a free action, you choose whether to apply the ability to one weapon or the other, or both. For each round you apply your bane class feature to two weapons, you expend 2 rounds of that feature.
