Your stench is overwhelmingly nauseating.

Prerequisites: Stench universal monster ability, <a href="featdisplay0ebd.html?ItemName=Improved%20Stench">Improved Stench</a>, <a href="featdisplay51bc.html?ItemName=Great%20Fortitude">Great Fortitude</a>

Benefit:  The first round a creature is affected by your stench, it is nauseated in addition to being sickened. At the end of an affected creature's turn after the first round, it can make a new save against the stench's DC to remove the nauseated condition, but the sickened condition lasts as long as normal.
