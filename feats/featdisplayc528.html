Calling on the power of Erastil, you can fire an arrow that heals instead of harms.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast cure spells, proficient with longbow, worshiper of Erastil.

Benefit:  Once per day when you cast a cure spell, you can replace the normal somatic component with drawing a longbow to create a shaft of green glowing light. When you fire the bow as a part of casting the spell and hit your target with a ranged touch attack, the green shaft of light cures the target as if it were touched by the cure spell.
