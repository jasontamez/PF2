Your Hellknight armor guards you against many threats.

Prerequisites: Heavy Armor Proficiency, base attack bonus +5, must swear allegiance to a single Hellknight order.

Benefit: Once per day as a full-round action, you can give your Hellknight armor the broken condition. Upon doing so, you are affected by one of the following spells (your choice), using your character level as your caster level: break enchantment, neutralize poison, remove disease, or remove paralysis. Once you have used this benefit, your Hellknight armor must be repaired as normal to restore its full bonus to your Armor Class and return its armor check penalty to normal.

You can use this ability even if paralyzed or otherwise restrained, but not if you are unconscious. For the purposes of this ability, "Hellknight armor" means any armor with the word "Hellknight" in its name. You cannot use this ability if your armor is already broken.
