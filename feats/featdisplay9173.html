You can weave pieces of beasts into your magic items.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7f69.html?ItemName=Craft%20Wondrous%20Item">Craft Wondrous Item</a>, <a href="featdisplayefb6.html?ItemName=Grisly%20Ornament">Grisly Ornament</a>, <a href="featdisplay9248.html?ItemName=Harvest%20Parts">Harvest Parts.</a>

Benefit: Whenever you use the Grisly Ornament feat, you are able to permanently integrate one ornament you have crafted using the harvested creature parts into a wondrous item. The ornament grants no ongoing benefits, but once per day you can activate an integrated ornament as a free action to gain its full benefits for 1 minute. You can integrate an ornament into a wondrous item (or replace an item's existing ornament) by spending 8 hours of work and 100 gp ?? the creature's CR.
