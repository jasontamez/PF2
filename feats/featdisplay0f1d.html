You and your allies have worked out a complex set of codes and phrases that allow you to secretly pass information back and forth.

Prerequisites: Bluff 1 rank, Linguistics 1 rank, Sense Motive 1 rank.

Benefit:  You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to pass secret messages to other characters that have this feat, and can communicate as much information as you could normally say in one round as a swift action.
