You can conceal the magic auras of poisons that you carry.

Prerequisites: Bluff 5 ranks, Craft (poison) 5 ranks, ability to cast nondetection.

Benefit:  Whenever a creature attempts to magically detect poison you are carrying, the creature must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + your character level. On a failed check, that spell or magic ability fails to detect any poison you possess for the duration of the spell.
