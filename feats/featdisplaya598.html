Your clan had an impressive collection of ancient artifacts, and you often see things on your journey that remind you of items in the clan hoard.

Prerequisites: Wyvaran.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks to determine an item's value and on Spellcraft checks to determine an item's magic properties. For every 5 points by which you exceed the DC, you can determine additional details about the item at the GM's discretion, such as its country of origin, the crafter's race, techniques employed in its creation, or whether it has any historical significance.
