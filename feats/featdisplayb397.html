You are skilled at approaching large foes with an ally in a way that makes it difficult for your foes to find an advantage against you or your ally.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, base attack bonus +3.

Benefit: You receive a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class against attacks of opportunity provoked by moving through a creature's reach, provided the creature is of a larger size category than you and provided at least one other ally with Circling Offense is within the creature's reach. If a creature that you're receiving this dodge bonus against attacks you and misses with the attack, it provokes attacks of opportunity from any of your allies who possess Circling Offense.
