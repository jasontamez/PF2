Aiming outsized siege weapons poses little difficulty for you.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaye48a.html?ItemName=Siege%20Engineer">Siege Engineer</a>, Profession (siege engineer) 5 ranks.

Benefit:  You take no size penalty for aiming a direct-fire siege weapon larger than yourself. If you operate an indirect-fire siege weapon and miss, you misdirect fire by 1 square per range increment.

Normal:  Direct-fire weapons impose a -2 attack roll penalty per size category by which the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. An indirect-fire weapon that misses misdirects fire by 1d4 squares per range increment.
