You rule over your own cabal of minions with a villainous cohort as your lieutenant.

Prerequisites: Any evil alignment, character level 7th.

Benefit: You can attract a loyal cohort and a number of intimidated followers to assist in your nefarious deeds. This feat is similar to Leadership, except Vile Leadership rewards-rather than punishes-leaders with cruel reputations or who cause their followers' deaths. Once you take this feat, you cannot take the Leadership feat without retraining your feat selection (Ultimate Campaign 191). Numerous factors can affect your Vile Leadership score (which acts as a Leadership score for the purpose of feats and abilities that rely on a Leadership score, other than Leadership itself ); work in conjunction with your GM and use the tables below to adjust your Vile Leadership score accordingly. The NPCs you attract must be of a nongood alignment.

Vile Leadership Modifiers: Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Vile Leadership score.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Leader's Reputation</td><td>Modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Ruthless</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Rewards loyalty or success</td><td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>Possesses a special power</td><td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>Indecisive</td><td>-1</td></tr> <tr><td>Tolerant of failure</td><td>-1</td></tr> <tr><td>Merciful</td><td>-2</td></tr> </table>

Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort with this feat, as listed below.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Leader's Attributes</td><td>Modifer</td></tr> <tr><td>Gained power by eliminating a superior</td><td>+1</td></tr> <tr><td>Fails to punish or kill minions who make costly mistakes</td><td>-2*</td></tr> <tr><td>Recruits a cohort of a different alignment</td><td>-1</td></tr> </table> * Cumulative per incident of compassion shown. This penalty is incurred even if you show mercy to avoid killing or punishing more than 20% of your minions during a given character level (see the footnote in the following table).

Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Leader's Attributes</td><td>Modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc.</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Has punished or killed minions to set an example or assert dominance</td><td>+1*</td></tr> <tr><td>Has a tendency toward long periods of inactivity</td><td>-1</td></tr> <tr><td>Restricts minions from looting, pillaging, or pursing other spoils of war</td><td>-1</td></tr> </table> * Cumulative to a maximum bonus of +1 per character level. If you punish or kill more than 20% of your minions during a given character level, this bonus becomes a penalty instead. When you gain a new level, any bonus or penalty from punishing or killing minions resets to 0.
