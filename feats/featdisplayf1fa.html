You tighten your grip around your target's throat.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaye823.html?ItemName=Kraken%20Style">Kraken Style</a>, base attack bonus +5 or monk level 5th.

Benefit:  The damage that you deal with the Kraken Style feat on a successful grapple combat maneuver check increases to an amount equal to your Wisdom bonus + 2.

While using this style, you can choke your opponent when you successfully maintain a grapple instead of choosing to damage, move, pin, or tie up your opponent. This suffocates your opponent (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445). The grappled opponent can take a breath during any round in which you do not maintain the grapple.
