You can call upon your connection to cloud dragons to veil your presence.

Prerequisites: Mbe-ke dwarf.

Benefit: Once per day, you can call upon your spiritual connection to cloud dragons to create a thick mist as a spell-like ability. The mist functions as <a href="spelldisplay6e1a.html?ItemName=Obscuring%20Mist">obscuring mist</a>, except it has a duration of only 1 round per level and is only a 10-foot-radius spread that is 10 feet high.
