Disarming Threat Deed (Panache)

Even your threats are curiously charming.

Prerequisites: Amateur Swashbuckler or panache class feature; Diplomacy 2 ranks, Intimidate 2 ranks.

Benefit:  When you succeed at an Intimidate check to force an opponent to act friendly toward you, you can spend 1 panache point to cause the target to regard you with indifference when the duration of the effect expires. A target influenced in this manner is unlikely to report you to authorities.

Normal:  An opponent forced to act friendly toward you by Intimidate becomes unfriendly when the duration expires, and is likely to report you to the authorities.
