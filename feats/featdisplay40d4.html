You can split the effect of one of your targeted hexes, affecting another creature you can see.

Prerequisites: Witch level 10th.

Benefit:  When you use one of your hexes (not a major hex or a grand hex) that targets a single creature, you can choose another creature within 30 feet of the first target to also be targeted by the hex.
