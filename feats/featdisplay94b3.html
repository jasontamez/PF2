Benefit:  Your bonus on saves against fire attacks and spells with the fire descriptor or light descriptor increases to +4. When you use Scorching Weapons, the affected weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage instead of 1, and when you are grappling, you deal this damage to your grappling opponent on your turn.

When you fail a saving throw against an effect that has the fire or light descriptor, you can spend 5 stamina points to reroll the saving throw. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.
