Snatch Arrows - Feats







Snatch Arrows (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 134</a>
Instead of knocking an arrow or ranged attack aside, you can catch it in mid-flight.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplayf9c9.html?ItemName=Deflect%20Arrows">Deflect Arrows</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit: When using the Deflect Arrows feat you may choose to catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons can immediately be thrown back as an attack against the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use.

You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 132</a>
When you snatch a thrown weapon, as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, you can make a thrown ranged attack with it against any target, not just the original attacker.

Mythic Snatch Arrows

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 74</a>
You can use the weapons you pluck from the air to immediately make melee attacks.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6b40.html?ItemName=Snatch%20Arrows">Snatch Arrows.</a>

Benefit:  When you use Snatch Arrows to catch a thrown weapon that can also be used as a melee weapon, you can make a melee attack with it as an immediate action against a foe within the weapon's melee reach. You can expend one use of mythic power to make this attack without spending an immediate action.
