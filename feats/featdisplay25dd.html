You can alter your smite ability, channeling the power of your deity into divine inspiration that grants you greater aptitude for performing combat maneuvers.

Prerequisites: Smite evil class feature, base attack bonus +5.

Benefit:  While using your smite evil class feature, as a swift action at the start of your turn, you can forgo the bonus on damage rolls and instead gain half that bonus as a bonus on combat maneuver checks against the target of your smite. The effects of your smite evil feature return to normal at the start of your next turn.
