You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When you successfully complete a dirty trick combat maneuver, you can spend 5 stamina points to make the condition you inflicted with that maneuver require a full-round action to remove (instead of a standard action).
