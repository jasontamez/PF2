Your unique physiology makes you particularly adept at wielding draconic magic.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 6 ranks, wyvaran.

Benefit: Select one spell you can cast that you gained through your draconic bloodline, the Scalykind domain (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 216), or the Dragon subdomain (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 224). It must be at least 1 spell level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast. You can cast this spell as a spell-like ability twice per day.
