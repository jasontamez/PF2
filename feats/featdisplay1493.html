You can shove aside multiple opponents while leaping into the air.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplay281d.html?ItemName=Bulette%20Charge%20Style">Bulette Charge Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay6051.html?ItemName=Improved%20Overrun">Improved Overrun</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, proficiency with heavy armor.

Benefit: While using Bulette Charge Style, you gain a bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump equal to your Strength bonus. Additionally, when you perform an overrun combat maneuver, you can attempt to overrun multiple foes, but you take a cumulative -2 penalty on each successive overrun attempt in the same round. If an overrun attempt fails, you cannot make any further attempts until your next round.
