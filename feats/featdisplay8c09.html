Thanks to your teeth's strength and quick growth, you are able to chew through nearly any obstacle given sufficient time.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay98c3.html?ItemName=Sharptooth">Sharptooth</a>, ratfolk.

Benefit:  Damage dealt by your bite attack ignores an amount of hardness equal to 3 plus half your character level. You can spend a full-round action to deal double your bite damage to an unattended, inanimate object.

Special:  If you have the Burrowing Teeth feat (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 154), you can burrow through solid stone at a speed of 5 feet per 10 minutes.
