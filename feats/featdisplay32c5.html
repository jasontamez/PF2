Your zeal for hunting your faith's enemies empowers your ability to channel divine energy, as long as you channel that energy for harm.

Prerequisites: Channel energy class feature, inquisitor level 1st.

Benefit:  When you use channel energy to deal damage, your inquisitor levels count as cleric levels for determining the number of damage dice and the saving throw DC.
