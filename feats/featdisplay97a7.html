Greater Blood Frenzy

Your wounds move you into a deeper frenzy.

Prerequisites: Blood frenzy ability, sahuagin.

Benefit:  You no longer take a penalty to AC while in a blood frenzy. In addition, if you strike an enemy with both of your claw attacks-or two or more claw attacks if you have extra limbs-while in a blood frenzy, you can rend (as the special attack), dealing an amount of additional damage equal to your claw damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus (minimum 0).
