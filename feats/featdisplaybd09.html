Djinni Spin - Feats







Djinni Spin (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 97</a>
You can surround yourself with the power of the storm, spinning like a hurricane to unleash a violent blast of electrical energy.

Prerequisites: Con 15, Wis 17, <a href="featdisplay0436.html?ItemName=Djinni%20Style">Djinni Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayaac3.html?ItemName=Djinni%20Spirit">Djinni Spirit</a>, <a href="featdisplay1029.html?ItemName=Elemental%20Fist">Elemental Fist</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 11th.

Benefit:  While using Djinni Style, as a standard action you can spend two Elemental Fist (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to surround yourself with a whirlwind of electrified air. Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your Elemental Fist and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being deafened.

Instead of spending two uses of Elemental Fist to surround yourself in a whirlwind of electrified air, you can spend one use of Elemental Fist and 2 stamina points.
