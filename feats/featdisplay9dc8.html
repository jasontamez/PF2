With a ferocious shout or vigorous gestures, you provoke an opponent's ire. By tricking the opponent into making a clumsy swing at you, you provide an opening for your allies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1c38.html?ItemName=Antagonize">Antagonize.</a>

Benefit:  When you take a 5-foot step, you can choose for that step to provoke attacks of opportunity from all opponents that threaten you after the step. You gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked in this manner.

Normal:  A 5-foot step doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.
