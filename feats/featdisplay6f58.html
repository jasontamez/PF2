You have mastered the impenetrable Aldori fighting style.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword).</a>

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks as long as you start combat with an Aldori dueling sword in your hand. As long as you wield only a single Aldori dueling sword in one hand (not using a shield, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons), you gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC. If you wield the sword in two hands, this bonus drops to a +1 shield bonus to AC. Although the dueling sword deals slashing damage, you treat it as if it were also a piercing weapon when determining the effects of weapons used by a duelist or swashbuckler.
