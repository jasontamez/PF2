You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When attempting to reposition a foe, you can spend 5 stamina points to increase your melee reach by 5 feet for the purpose of determining where you can move the foe.
