Your gaseous state is more potent than that of your peers.

Prerequisites: Vampire.

Benefit:  As a standard action, you can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but can remain gaseous indefinitely and have a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. This is a supernatural ability.

If you already possess the gaseous form special quality, you can instead choose to augment your gaseous form in one of the following ways. These effects apply only to creatures that enter your space while you are in gaseous form.

Glitterdust (Su): Creatures must succeed at a Will save or be blinded and outlined in golden particles as though under the effects of <a href="spelldisplayc127.html?ItemName=glitterdust">glitterdust</a>.

Mind Fog (Su): Creatures must succeed at a Will save or take penalties as though under the effects of <a href="spelldisplay7012.html?ItemName=mind%20fog">mind fog</a>. This effect lasts as long as a creature shares your space and for 2d6 rounds after.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take this feat, choose another swarm type.
