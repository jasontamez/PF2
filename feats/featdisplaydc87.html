Pointing out your shared kinship with someone gives you the chance to win over creatures associated with your bloodline.

Prerequisites: Bluff 1 rank, bloodline class feature, gnome.

Benefit: When attempting a Diplomacy check to influence a creature with a plausible connection to your sorcerous bloodline, you may instead make a Bluff check. For example, a gnome sorcerer with the draconic bloodline may use this feat against dragons and their kin, but no other creatures.
