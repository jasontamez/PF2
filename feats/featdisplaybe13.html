Your perspective of normality is slightly skewed, and you are easily awed by things such as commonplace tools or mundane activities. You struggle to find your place in a world that seems continually poised to overwhelm your senses.

Prerequisites: You must have a fey ancestor somewhere in your family line, and you must have the Adopted by the Fey, Fey Meeting, or Met a Fantastic Creature background (Ultimate Campaign 21, 30, and 24, respectively).

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based ability checks and skill checks other than Diplomacy checks.

Goal: You must succeed at your saving throws against five different spells with the emotion descriptor or attempts to apply the fascinated condition to you.

Special: Your ever-present awe is under your control. Your bonus on Charisma-based skill checks now also applies on your Diplomacy checks. You can increase any morale bonus you receive by 1.
