You distract your enemies with ranged attacks to protect your allies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot.</a>

Benefit:  You can use the aid another action with a ranged attack against an opponent, regardless of whether the opponent threatens an ally. Range penalties apply to this attack roll. Choose one ally when making the attack. If the attack is successful, that ally gains a +2 bonus to AC against that opponent's next attack, as long as the attack comes before the beginning of your next turn. All allies with this feat also gain this bonus against that opponent.
