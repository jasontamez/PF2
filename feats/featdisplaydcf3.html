You come from one of Varisia's rural regions, where you were raised in an environment of rustic tradition, honest work, and common sense.

Prerequisites: 1st-level character, cannot have City Born or Lone Wolf.

Benefit: childhood of farm work, apprenticeship, or similar toil has granted you reserves of endurance. Once per day, when an effect would normally leave you fatigued or exhausted, you may ignore the fatigue or exhaustion effect. This ability activates the first time you are affected by fatigue or exhaustion in a day - you cannot "save" it to apply it to a specific effect. Your traditional upbringing has sharpened your willpower as well, granting a +1 bonus on Will saves.
