Your hypnotic gaze causes tremendous pain in its victims.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist level 3rd, painful stare class feature.

Benefit: You can trigger your painful stare one additional time per round.

Special: This feat can be taken once by a 3rd-level mesmerist, and again when he reaches 9th and 15th levels. Its effects stack. A mesmerist can take this feat in place of a bold stare improvement.
