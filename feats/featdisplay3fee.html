You can tattoo arcane runes upon your flesh or the flesh of others.

Prerequisites: Caster level 3rd.

Benefit: You can create runes. Inscribing a rune takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To inscribe a rune, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half of its base price.
