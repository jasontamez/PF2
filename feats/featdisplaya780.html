Your magical creations are hardier than most.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay9939.html?ItemName=Craft%20Magic%20Arms%20and%20Armor">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a>, ability to cast make whole or mending.

Benefit: When you craft a magic weapon, magic armor, or magic shield, you can add a fortifying element to the item. This increases the item's total construction cost by 10%. If it's a weapon, when it becomes broken, the penalty to attack and damage rolls is reduced to -1 (this can never reduce a broken weapon's penalty to attack and damage to 0 or a positive number). If it's a suit of armor or a shield, when it becomes broken, the bonus it grants to AC is reduced by one-quarter, rounding down. Other drawbacks of the broken condition to weapons, armor, and shields still apply as normal. Normal: A broken weapon imposes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. The bonus a broken suit of armor or a broken shield grants to AC is halved.
