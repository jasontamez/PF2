Meditation clears your mind, allowing you to concentrate on your spells as if not distracted.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplayc271.html?ItemName=Combat%20Meditation">Combat Meditation</a>, <a href="featdisplayade4.html?ItemName=Meditation%20Master">Meditation Master</a>, character level 5th.

Benefit:  For 1 round per character level after you perform combat meditation, whenever you attempt a concentration check to avoid losing a spell or a Fortitude save to resist a distraction effect (such as the distraction ability of a swarm), you gain a +4 bonus on the check. If you choose to use the benefits of Combat Meditation on the check, the bonus applies to both die rolls.
