Blinding Sneak Attack - Feats







Blinding Sneak Attack (Combat)

When you strike from the cover of darkness, you inject foes with a fraction of your foul magic.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +5, darkness spell-like ability, sneak attack class feature, tiefling.

Benefit:  When you successfully deal sneak attack damage to a foe while you are within an area of magical darkness, you temporarily blind your opponent for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the amount of sneak attack damage dealt) negates this effect.
