Whether because you were lost in wilderness or quarantined during a plague, you died alone, unnoticed, and unmourned. Your body might not have been discovered for weeks.

Prerequisites: Duskwalker.

Benefit: Twice per day, if you are reduced below 0 hit points, as an immediate action you can move up to twice your base speed. If this brings you into cover or concealment, you can also attempt a Stealth check to hide. At 11th level, you can use this feat two additional times per day.
