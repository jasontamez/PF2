Lashing Tail (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpya1am">Planar Adventures pg. 30</a>
Your tail is either thick and heavy enough to serve as a weapon, or else is adorned with barbs or quills that weaponize its lashing length.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay44f7.html?ItemName=Grasping%20Tail">Grasping Tail</a>, you must have a tail.

Benefit: You gain a tail slap natural attack that deals damage as appropriate for your size (1d6 points for a Medium creature, or 1d4 points for a small creature). When you first gain this feat, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing; this is the type of damage your tail inflicts, and it cannot be later changed. Due to the inherent awkwardness of attacking with your tail, you can't make a tail slap attack and other natural weapon attacks as part of the same full attack. Treat your tail slap attack as a secondary attack if you also attack with a manufactured weapon as part of a full-attack action.
