When using this feat's benefit, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to reduce the damage from the intercepted attack by an amount equal to double the number of stamina points you spent this way. This does not alter other effects from that attack (such as bleed, poison, etc.), even if the damage is reduced to 0.
