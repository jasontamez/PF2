A realm's light gravity lets you reach your full potential.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Acrobatics 3 ranks.

Benefit: Your land speed increases by 10 feet while on a plane with light gravity, and other creatures do not gain a circumstance bonus on attack rolls against you from light gravity. At the GM's discretion, these effects might apply to certain environments on the Material Plane, such as low-gravity planets. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks; if you have 10 or more ranks in Acrobatics, this bonus increases to +4. This bonus does not stack with that provided by the Acrobatic feat.
