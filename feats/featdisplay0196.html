The power of your blow leaves your enemies reeling.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a> with bludgeoning weapon, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: As a standard action, make a single attack with your chosen weapon. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a Reflex save with a DC equal to 10 + your base attack bonus or lose its ability to make attacks of opportunity until the beginning of your next turn. When your base attack bonus reaches +11, you can instead cause the target to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC. When your base attack bonus reaches +16, you can instead cause the target to become flat footed. You can use this feat's benefits only once per minute.
