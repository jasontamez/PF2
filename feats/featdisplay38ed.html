Your stench is poisonous.

Prerequisites: Stench universal monster ability, immunity to poison, <a href="featdisplay0ebd.html?ItemName=Improved%20Stench">Improved Stench</a>, <a href="featdisplay1698.html?ItemName=Toughness">Toughness</a>

Benefit:  The first round a creature is affected by your stench, it must also make a successful Fortitude save against the same DC to resist becoming poisoned. If you have 10 or fewer HD, this poison is identical to insanity mist; if you have 11 or more HD, the poison also adds confusion for 1 round to its effects.
