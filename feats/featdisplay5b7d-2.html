Your masterful shieldwork provides even greater protection to your vital areas.

Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected shield, <a href="featdisplay391f.html?ItemName=Greater%20Shield%20Focus">Greater Shield Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, Shield Specialization with selected shield, fighter level 12th.

Benefit:  Choose one type of shield (buckler, light, heavy, or tower shield) for which you possess the Shield Specialization feat. With the selected shield, you gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against critical hit confirmation rolls (this bonus stacks with that from Shield Specialization). In addition, once per day you may negate a critical hit, and damage is instead rolled normally.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of shield.
