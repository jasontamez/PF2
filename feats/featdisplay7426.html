Horrible wounds, whether on yourself or your enemies, make your blood sing.

Prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, rage class feature.

Benefit:  When you are raging and you confirm a critical hit with a melee weapon or a critical hit is confirmed on you (whether by a melee weapon, spell, or ranged weapon), you regain 1 round of rage (up to your maximum for the day). You can only gain this benefit once per round.
