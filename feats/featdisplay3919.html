You have learned how to fight effectively while drunk.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance</a>, worshiper of Cayden Cailean.

Benefit:  When you drink a tankard of ale or strong alcohol, you take a -2 penalty on Reflex saving throws, but gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level, and gain a +2 alchemical bonus on Fortitude and Will saving throws. These bonuses last 1 hour or until the temporary hit points gained by this effect are lost, whichever occurs first. Regardless, the penalty lasts for a full hour.
