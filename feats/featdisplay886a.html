You can create barriers of force with abjuration magic items.

Prerequisites: Use Magic Device 3 ranks, base Fortitude saving throw bonus +3.

Benefit: You can cause an item that has an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher listed in its construction requirements to create a magical effect that functions like shield, except the shield bonus to AC gained is equal to 1/3 your base Fortitude save bonus (minimum +1). You can use this feat once per day, plus an additional time per day when your base Fortitude save bonus reaches +6, +9, and +12.
