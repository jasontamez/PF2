Greater Overrun (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 125</a>
Enemies must dive to avoid your dangerous move.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6051.html?ItemName=Improved%20Overrun">Improved Overrun</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +6, Str 13.

Benefit: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to overrun a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by Improved Overrun. Whenever you overrun opponents, they provoke attacks of opportunity if they are knocked prone by your overrun.

Normal: Creatures knocked prone by your overrun do not provoke an attack of opportunity.

If you succeed at a combat maneuver check to overrun an opponent, but do not exceed your opponent's CMD by 5 or more, you can spend 2 stamina points to knock the target prone anyway.
