When you infuse weapons, you may add an additional magical quality.

Prerequisites: Infuse weapon special ability, Cha 27

Benefit:  When you infuse a weapon, you can add an additional +1 worth of weapon qualities to that weapon; this could either be used to increase a weapon infused to be a +1 weapon to be a +2 weapon, or to grant a weapon quality like flaming, defending, keen, or any other +1 quality from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. This effect occurs automatically as you infuse a weapon, but you may only do so to one weapon you wield at a time.

Special:  You may take this feat more than once; each time you do, the limit to the number of weapons on which you can simultaneously use Improved Infuse Weapon increases by 2.
