You can use any bardic performance ability without making a sound.

Prerequisites: Bardic performance class feature, <a href="featdisplayd701.html?ItemName=Extra%20Performance">Extra Performance</a>, <a href="featdisplay460f.html?ItemName=Master%20Performer">Master Performer</a>, bard level 12th, Kitharodian Academy 15 TPA.

Benefit: You can use your audible-component bardic performance as visual-component bardic performances. Any bardic ability used in this manner expends 4 times as many bardic performance rounds as normal.
