You are ferocious at hewing smaller opponents.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay2107.html?ItemName=Cleave">Cleave</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +11, dwarf.

Benefit: When using Cleave or Great Cleave, if your initial attack hits, you may take a single 5-foot step as a free action before making your additional attacks. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional Cleave attack(s) as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.

Normal: You may only make additional attacks with Cleave against creatures you threaten when you make your initial attack.

When using this feat, once per round when you hit a creature with a follow-up Cleave attack, you can spend 5 stamina points to take a second 5-foot step as a free action. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional Cleave attacks as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.
