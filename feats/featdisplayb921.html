You have learned to turn your speed into power, even with a heavier blade.

Prerequisites: Dexterity 13, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, Perform (dance) 2 ranks, proficient with scimitar.

Benefit: When wielding a scimitar with one hand, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on melee attack and damage rolls. You treat the scimitar as a one-handed piercing weapon for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist's precise strike ability). The scimitar must be for a creature of your size. You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a weapon or shield in your off hand.
