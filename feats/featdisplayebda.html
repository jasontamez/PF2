You are at home on the shifting waves of sand.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Con 13.

Benefit: When desert terrain would reduce your overland movement speed to 1/2 normal, you can move at 3/4 your normal speed. You gain a +2 bonus to Survival checks to find food and water, and to checks to avoid getting lost in a desert.
