You take after your long-lived elven parent more than other half-elves. While your life-span is not any longer than usual, age weighs less heavily on your shoulders.

Prerequisites: Half-elf.

Benefit: You gain a +4 racial bonus to resist any effect that would magically age you or otherwise displace you in time. In addition, you reduce all penalties gained from magical aging by 1.
