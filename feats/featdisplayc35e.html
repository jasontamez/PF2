You gain unusual resiliency from your mortal heritage.

Prerequisites: Dhampir.

Benefit:  You are healed by channeled positive energy used to heal living creatures and channeled negative energy used to heal undead, but both only heal half the normal amount. You still take damage from positive energy used to harm undead, such as that from channeled energy and lay on hands.
