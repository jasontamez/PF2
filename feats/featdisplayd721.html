You can fortify undead against positive energy.

Prerequisites: Channel energy 6d6, worshiper of Urgathoa.

Benefit:  Whenever you channel negative energy to heal undead creatures, you grant all undead you heal +1 channel resistance (or a +1 bonus to their existing channel resistance) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).
