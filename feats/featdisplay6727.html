You can focus your ability to detect evil for more practical or mundane purposes

Prerequisites: Detect evil class feature.

Benefit:  As a swift action, you can focus the clarity granted by your detect evil ability to heighten your awareness of other things. This gives you a +10 sacred bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks for one round. This expends your use of the detect evil class ability for the next 24 hours.
