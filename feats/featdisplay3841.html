Turn Undead - Feats







Turn Undead

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 136</a>
Calling upon higher powers, you cause undead to flee from the might of your unleashed divine energy.

Prerequisites: Channel positive energy class feature.

Benefit: You can, as a standard action, use one of your uses of channel positive energy to cause all undead within 30 feet of you to flee, as if panicked. Undead receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. Undead that fail their save flee for 1 minute. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to end the effect. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).

Mythic Turn Undead

The power of your divine energy can not only cause undead to flee but also destroy them where they stand.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay3841.html?ItemName=Turn%20Undead">Turn Undead.</a>

Benefit:  When you use Turn Undead, the range increases by 10 feet per tier, and non-mythic undead take a penalty on their saving throws equal to your tier.

You can expend one use of mythic power when using Turn Undead to destroy undead. Instead of fleeing, undead that fail their saves might be destroyed. You destroy 2d4 Hit Dice worth of undead per tier. Undead with the fewest HD are affected first; among undead with equal HD, those that are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No undead of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that aren't sufficient to affect an undead are wasted.
