Your past failure haunts you and drives you on.


Prerequisites: You must have lost class features by
violating the code of conduct of a class that possesses such
a code, or have the Dishonored Family background.

Benefit:  As an immediate action, you can add a +1 bonus
to the result of an ability check, attack roll, saving throw,
or skill check you have just rolled by becoming shaken for
1 minute. You must choose before the result is revealed.


Goal:  Regain any lost class features and complete a
quest to prove your worth. In the course of completing
this quest, you must decisively defeat a challenging
foe. The quest should relate in some fashion to the
transgression that removed your class abilities or led to
you being disgraced.


Completion Benefit:  You gain the ability to reroll a
failed saving throw once per day. You must keep the result
of the second roll, even if it is lower.
