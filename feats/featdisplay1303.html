Burning torches and the discordant symphony of riotous singing ignite the fervor within you.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1, goblin.

Benefit:  Whenever you make an attack with a torch, a flask of lamp oil fitted with a fuse, alchemist's fire, or a flaming weapon, you gain a morale bonus on your damage roll equal to the number of goblin allies within 30 feet who also have this feat (maximum +4). This bonus damage is fire damage.
