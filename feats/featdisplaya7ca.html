Your wild shapes are mighty and muscular.

Prerequisites: Wild shape class feature, druid level 8th.

Benefit:  When in wild shape, treat your size as one category larger for the purpose of calculating CMB, CMD, carrying capacity, and any size-based special attacks you use or that are used against you (such as grab, swallow whole, and trample).

Mythic Powerful Shape

The forms you take in wild shape tower over their natural counterparts.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya7ca.html?ItemName=Powerful%20Shape">Powerful Shape.</a>

Benefit:  You can apply the giant simple template (quick rules version, from Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295) to any form you take with wild shape. This replaces the benefit from Powerful Shape.

As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to combine the benefit from this feat with the benefit from non-mythic Powerful Shape for a number of rounds equal to your tier.
