Your understanding of the esoteric teachings of the Arclords of Nex allows you to open an eldritch eye that grants you superior perception of the magical world.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, ability to cast arcane spells.

Benefit: Once per day as a standard action, you can open an incandescent third eye upon your forehead. The eye can remain open for 1 minute, during which time you cast all divination spells at +1 caster level (as long as you begin casting the spell before the eye closes), gain darkvision 60 feet, and can use detect magic (as the spell of the same name). You gain a +8 bonus on Perception checks to notice invisible creatures while the eye is open as well.
