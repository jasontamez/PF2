Other animals of your species adore you. No matter how territorial, ill-tempered, wounded, or hungry they are, they see you as a friend, not an enemy. They'll give your two-legged friend the benefit of the doubt as well.

Prerequisites: Animal companion.

Benefit: Other animals of roughly the same kind as you (cats to felines, eagles to raptors, frogs to amphibians, etc.) have their starting attitudes toward you improved by two steps. Their attitudes towards your master are likewise improved by one step.

Special: If your master has the <a href="classdisplaye64c.html?ItemName=Hunter">animal focus class feature</a>, this feat also applies to any animals of roughly the same kind as your active animal focus.
