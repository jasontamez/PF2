Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against divine spells and the spell-like abilities granted by levels in a divine casting class.

Special:  In certain circumstances, some outsiders and creatures of other types might have a strong connection to a specific deity they work for as agents and servants. These creatures' spells and spell-like abilities should likewise be affected by this feat, regardless of the creatures' planar origins or sources of magical power, subject to the GM's discretion.
