Twisted Love (Story)

An evil person or entity has become obsessed with your resemblance to a lost loved one.

Prerequisites: You resemble a lost loved one of an evil creature who would otherwise be a challenging foe. The likeness is close enough for you to be mistaken as the former loved one's reincarnation, or you might be that loved one reborn in a new life. Alternately, the creature might be a former lover who has become evil and wishes to resume the relationship. This unwanted relationship must be contrary to your alignment or long-term goals. Thematically appropriate backgrounds include Born out of Time, Current Lover, Reincarnated, The Lover, and Troubled First Love (all of which are found in Ultimate Campaign).

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects and a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to influence your would-be love or her minions and servants.

Goal: You must break the heart of your pursuer in a dramatic and significant manner. This requires you to interact closely and frequently enough with the entity to cause her to become emotionally compromised or vulnerable. A simple rebuff or refusal of her affections is insufficient to satisfy this goal and might only further drive the obsessed creature to capture you, cast charm spells upon you, corrupt you, or transform you in a way that would make you more sympathetic to her.

Completion Benefit: You retain your +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. If you succeed at a Will save against such an effect, the caster does not learn that you succeeded at your saving throw (effects such as detect magic and analyze dweomer still work normally). However, this benefit doesn't inform you of the nature of the effect cast upon you. The spurned entity might later seek revenge for the humiliation but is no longer obsessed with you. You also receive the completion benefit even if the formerly obsessed entity is slain, though you never receive the benefit if the entity perishes before you can achieve your goal.
