You can pry open a mighty beast's grasp or snapping jaws.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit: As a standard action, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a -5 penalty against a creature that is currently grappling another creature via its grab special ability. If you succeed, you pry open the creature's grasp, releasing any creatures it had grappled.

Additionally, you can ready an action to trigger if a creature attempts a bite attack against you. When the readied action triggers, you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a +2 bonus. If you succeed, you grapple the creature and cause the bite attack to miss. As long as you maintain the grapple, the creature can't use its bite attack.
