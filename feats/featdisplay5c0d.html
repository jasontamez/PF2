By using lay on hands, you can bring the dead back to life.

Prerequisites: Cha 19, <a href="featdisplay2015.html?ItemName=Greater%20Mercy">Greater Mercy</a>, lay on hands, mercy class feature.

Benefit:  You can expend 10 uses of lay on hands to bring a single dead creature you touch back to life as a raise dead spell with a caster level equal to your paladin level. You must provide the material component for raise dead or choose to accept 1 temporary negative level; this level automatically goes away after 24 hours, never becomes a permanent negative level, and cannot be overcome in any way except by waiting for the duration to expire.
