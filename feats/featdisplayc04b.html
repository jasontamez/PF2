Your magical power used to originate in yourself, but now you draw it from others.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay735c.html?ItemName=Mutilating%20Ritualist">Mutilating Ritualist</a>, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks.

Benefit: You can improve your ability to cast an occult ritual (Occult Adventures 208) by powering it with the blood of creatures. When you begin the occult ritual with the death of a sentient creature (or number of sentient creatures with a total number of Hit Dice equal to twice the effective level of the ritual), you and all secondary casters gain a +4 bonus on all skill checks necessary to complete the occult ritual. This feat's sacrifices are in addition to any sacrifices normally required to complete the ritual.
