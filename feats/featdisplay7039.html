You enhance the force of your ki throws, enabling you to devastate your opponents as you slam them to the ground.

Prerequisites: Ki pool class feature, Ki Throw (see the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide).

Benefit:  When using the Ki Throw feat, you can expend 1 ki point to amplify the force of your attack. If your ki throw succeeds, when the target hits the ground, it takes damage as if you had hit it with an unarmed strike.
