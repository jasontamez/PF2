Your long exposure to necromantic energies has granted you a small measure of resistance against them.

Prerequisites: Con 13, Geb affinity.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist spells and effects from the school of necromancy. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Fort saves made to prevent negative levels from becoming permanent. Finally, if you take ability score damage (but not drain) from an undead creature, you take 1 point less damage (minimum 0).
