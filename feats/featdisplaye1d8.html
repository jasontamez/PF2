At the moment of your victory, you can help your foe to see as you do.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +6 or <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">monk level 6th</a>.

Benefit: When your melee attack would reduce an opponent to 0 or fewer hit points or render the opponent unconscious, you can elect to forgo this damage and instead attempt a Diplomacy check to influence the target's attitude. The DC of this check is equal to 20 + the creature's Hit Dice + the creature's Charisma modifier. You gain a bonus equal to half the damage you would have dealt and can use your base attack bonus instead of your ranks in Diplomacy. Unlike with a normal Diplomacy check, you can increase the target's attitude toward you by more than two steps. You can use the benefits of this feat only against enemies who attacked you and whom you did not attack or otherwise provoke first.
