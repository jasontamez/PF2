Your bullets ignite when you fire them.

Prerequisites: Grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: As long as you have at least 1 grit point when using a firearm to fire bullets, pellets, or similar ammunition, you can choose for half of the attack's damage to deal fire damage and the other half to deal bludgeoning and piercing damage. If you spend 1 grit point when you declare such an attack with a firearm, you can grant the bullet or pellets fired the flaming weapon special ability for that attack only.
