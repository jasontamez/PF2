The fury of lightning storms fuels you and your allies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a>, ability to cast a 1st-level or higher spell with the electricity descriptor.

Benefit:  If you ready an action to cast a 1st-level or higher spell with the electricity descriptor when an ally within 30 feet who has this feat casts a 1st-level or higher spell with the electricity descriptor, when you cast your spell both you and that ally gain the ability to have the next weapon attack you augment with the Arcane Strike feat deal an additional 1d4 points of electricity damage on a hit. These attacks must be made before the end of the next round.
