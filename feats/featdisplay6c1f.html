Kinetic energy propels you when you jump.

Prerequisites: Acrobatics 3 ranks, kinetic blast class feature.

Benefit:  Once per day as a swift action, you can conjure a burst of energy from your kinetic blast to help you jump a long distance, adding a +10 bonus on your Acrobatics check to jump; if you have at least 10 ranks in Acrobatics, the bonus increases to +20. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can use this ability at will until your burn is removed.
