Your loathing of undead is so great that even your allies can feel it.

Prerequisites: Duskwalker, ghost hunter racial trait.

Benefit: When you use your ghost hunter ability to grant your weapons the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> special ability, you can also affect the weapons of allies within 30 feet of you. You can activate ghost hunter an additional time each day.
