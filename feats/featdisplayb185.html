Your form flexes and contorts in unexpected ways, making it difficult for enemies to move you against your will.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2310.html?ItemName=Shapeshifter%20Style">Shapeshifter Style</a>, base attack bonus +5, change shape ability, shapechanger subtype.

Benefit: While you are using <a href="featdisplay2310.html?ItemName=Shapeshifter%20Style">Shapeshifter Style</a>, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD versus bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers. If you begin your turn with the grappled condition, you can attempt a combat maneuver check or an Escape Artist check as a move action to attempt to break the grapple.

Special: A character with the wild shape class feature counts as having the change shape ability and shapechanger subtype for the purpose of meeting this feat's prerequisites.
