With their deaths, the pitiful wretches that inhabit this
world open your path to greatness.


Prerequisites: You must slay at least 50 intelligent
noncombatants for either your own personal gain or for
no cause at all, or have the Bloodthirsty, First Kill, or The
Kill background.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.
If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus
increases to +4. Each time you slay an intelligent creature,
you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and caster level checks
for 1 minute (this bonus does not stack with itself ).


Goal:  Slay at least 200 more intelligent noncombatants,
then slay a challenging foe that seeks to either bring you
to justice for your crimes or usurp your position.


Completion Benefit:  Any shaken creature takes double
the normal penalties when attacking you, making saves
against your abilities, or resolving skill checks with you
as a target.
