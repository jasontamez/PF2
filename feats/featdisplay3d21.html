Your life has been shaped by an encounter with a powerful
dragon, and you have dedicated your life to seeing that
dragon dead.

Prerequisites: You must have been knocked unconscious
in an encounter with a challenging draconic foe or have
a regional background tied to a specific dragon (such as
those presented in this section or a similar trait).

Benefit: Choose one kind of dragon (such as blue, green,
or silver). You gain a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against the
breath weapons of dragons of the chosen kind, as well as a
+1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against
members of the same dragon kind.

Goal: Defeat the specific dragon linked to your prerequisite.

Completion Benefit: You gain the ability to select a
new dragon kind whenever you wish. You must first
defeat a member of the selected kind with a CR equal to
or greater than your character level. In addition, you gain
a +2 bonus on initiative checks when facing a dragon of
your selected kind.
