You have read the texts of the perfect way, and know how identify to your enemies' weak spot.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplaye15b.html?ItemName=Kirin%20Style">Kirin Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, Knowledge (arcana) 9 ranks, Knowledge (dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 insight bonus on Knowledge checks made to identify creatures, including the one Kirin Style allows. While using Kirin Style against a creature you have identified using that feat, as a swift action after you have hit a creature with a melee or ranged attack, you can add twice your Intelligence modifier in damage (minimum 2).

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, when you hit a creature you have identified with Kirin Style, you add your Intelligence modifier to melee and ranged attack damage rolls against that creature for the next 24 hours. You still can take a swift action to add twice your Intelligence modifier to damage rolls, but that damage doesn't stack with the damage from this combat trick.
