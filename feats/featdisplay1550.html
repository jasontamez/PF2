Your phantom is highly observant, and its link with you increases your own watchfulness.

Prerequisites: Phantom class feature.

Benefit:  While your phantom is within your reach, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Perception, this bonus increases to +8. This doesn't apply if your phantom is helpless or unconscious.
