Although you are of mixed heritage, the magic of your drow relatives flows freely through your veins.

Prerequisites: Half-elf.

Benefit:  You gain the ability to cast dancing lights, darkness, and faerie fire each once per day as a spell-like ability. You use your character level as your caster level for these abilities. Alternatively, you can instead gain any one racial trait that elves can exchange for the elven magic racial trait.

Special:  You can take this feat only at 1st level. If you take this feat, you cannot take the Human Spirit or Elven Spirit feat.
