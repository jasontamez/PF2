You can adapt your defenses to any situation.


Prerequisites: Spellcraft 7 ranks.

Benefit:  As a standard action, you can alter one of
your ongoing abjuration or transmutation spells.
It must be currently affecting you and must
grant a choice of options when cast. You
change its benefit to a different one from
the same list. In order to accomplish this,
you must make a successful Spellcraft
check (DC equal to 10 + the level of the
spell to be altered). The duration of
the spell is reduced to half of the spell's
remaining duration. For example, a 7th-level
wizard could change her resist energy
( fire) spell with 50 minutes of its duration
remaining into resist energy (cold), but the new
duration would be 25 minutes. This ability does not
change the benefit for any other creatures targeted by the
original spell.
