You can use stone around you to help you avoid attacks.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, <a href="featdisplay3712.html?ItemName=Stone%20Shroud">Stone Shroud</a>, Stealth 6 ranks, dwarf, stonecunning racial trait.

Benefit: While in areas of rocky terrain or while underground, you can gain 10% miss chance as a swift action. Alternatively, you can take a moment to better position yourself and gain concealment as a move action. The miss chance or concealment you gain from this feat does not stack with similar effects and remains until the start of your next turn.
