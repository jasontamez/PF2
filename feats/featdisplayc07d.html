You use projectiles and special trick shots that lose less accuracy when underwater.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb19b.html?ItemName=Far%20Shot">Far Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: Your projectile attacks take a -1 penalty per 5 feet of water between you and the target. You still can't use thrown weapons effectively underwater except in special circumstances (see page 44).

Normal: Projectile attacks underwater take a -2 penalty per 5 feet of water between the shooter and the target.
