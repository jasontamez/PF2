Thanks to your preparation, your arcane ability is more varied than most.

Prerequisites: Minor magic rogue talent.

Benefit:  By studying a spellbook for 10 minutes, you can change one spell you are able to cast using your minor magic or major magic rogue talent to one sorcerer/wizard spell of the same level contained in the spellbook. This change is permanent until you take the time to change it via this feat again.
