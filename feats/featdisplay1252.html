Scrying and other difficult divinations become more likely to get to the truth when you use verdant salts.

Benefit: When you cast a divination spell using verdant salts as an esoteric material component, you're more likely to get good information. You gain one of the following benefits, as appropriate to the spell: you increase the likelihood of a percentage-based divination to work correctly by 5% (giving a -5 penalty on the d% roll for <a href="spelldisplay54f1.html?ItemName=contact%20other%20plane">contact other plane</a>, for example), you gain a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks while perceiving through a divination (scrying) spell such as <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a>, or you can ask one additional question (with <a href="spelldisplay54f1.html?ItemName=contact%20other%20plane">contact other plane</a> or <a href="spelldisplay0970.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20dead">speak with dead</a>).

When you gain verdant salts' greater component effect with a divination spell, increase the DC by an additional 1.
