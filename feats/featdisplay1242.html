You can channel your inner magic to summon allies.

Prerequisites: Character level 5th, hydraulic push spell-like ability, undine.

Benefit: Once per day, you may expend your racial hydraulic push ability to instead cast summon nature's ally III as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. This use of the ability can only summon 1d3 Small water elementals, 1d4+1 dolphins, a shark, or an electric eel. Using this ability is a full-round action.
