You hoist your opponent above your head before slamming him to the ground, temporarily staggering the foe.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay3010.html?ItemName=Savage%20Slam">Savage Slam</a>, base attack bonus +9 or <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">monk level 6th</a>.

Benefit: While you are using <a href="featdisplay3010.html?ItemName=Savage%20Slam">Savage Slam</a>, if you succeed at your grapple combat maneuver check to knock your opponent prone, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or be staggered for 1 round. Oozes, incorporeal creatures, and creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this effect.
