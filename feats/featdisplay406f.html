You can perform simple alchemical tasks with preternatural speed.

Prerequisites: Craft (alchemy) 1 rank.

Benefit:  When performing spontaneous alchemy, you can craft an alchemical item as a standard action if its total crafting time is 10 minutes or less and you have all the equipment and materials required in hand. Items that require 1 hour to create with spontaneous alchemy take you only 10 minutes, and items that require 1 day take you only 1 hour. If you have the alchemy class feature, you can identify a potion using the Craft (alchemy) skill as if using detect magic as a swift action rather than a standard action.
