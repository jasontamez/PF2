You instinctively channel your latent magical abilities through your firearm.

Prerequisites: Amateur Gunslinger feat or grit class feature, Spellcraft 5 ranks.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can spend 1 grit point to convert your gun's damage into acid, fire, electricity, or cold damage for 1 round. You can choose a different damage type each time you use this ability. This still counts as a ranged weapon attack for critical hit multipliers and abilities such as <a href="featdisplay7ebb.html?ItemName=Deadly%20Aim">Deadly Aim</a>.
