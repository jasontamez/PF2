Adept Channel

Some orc adepts enjoy a greater connection to their gods, and can channel their faith through their unholy symbols. You gain the ability to channel energy as a cleric.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast divine spells, summon familiar class ability, caster level 4th, Cha 13.

Benefit: You gain the channel energy class feature, as a cleric, usable 2 times per day. This ability otherwise functions like the cleric's channel energy ability, except that your effective cleric level is equal to your divine spellcasting class level -3. Unlike a cleric, however, the number of times per day you may channel energy is not affected by your Charisma modifier.
