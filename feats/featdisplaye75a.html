Your staff is valuable for attack and defensive balance.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaye75a.html?ItemName=Tripping%20Staff">Tripping Staff.</a>

Benefit:  You add half your tier to CMD against trip maneuvers and on combat maneuver checks to trip with a quarterstaff. When you're wielding a quarterstaff and an opponent you threaten attempts to trip you and fails, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You must use your staff for this attack of opportunity.
