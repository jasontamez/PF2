Your time in the wild has made you adept at finding cheap, natural substitutes for spell components that would be impossible to find outside of civilized society.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay39f8.html?ItemName=Eschew%20Materials">Eschew Materials.</a>

Benefit:  Once per day, you can attempt a Profession (Herbalist) or Survival check to use herbal substitutes for the required material components of a single spell that normally cost up to 25 gp (DC = 5 + the gp value of component). These components can be used only for your own spells and can't be sold. They decay within a week if not used.

Normal:  You must buy spell components for any spell requiring a material component.
