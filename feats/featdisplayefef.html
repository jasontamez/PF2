You can pull in foes with your whip and attack them with your sword.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc732.html?ItemName=Balor%20Whip">Balor Whip</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (whip)</a>, <a href="featdisplayf000.html?ItemName=Whip%20Mastery">Whip Mastery</a>, base attack bonus +12.

Benefit: When you succeed at a drag attempt with your whip against a non-adjacent target and the target ends the drag adjacent to you, as a free action you can make a single attack against the target at your highest attack bonus using the melee weapon held in your other hand. You gain an additional +2 bonus on drag combat maneuver checks when using a whip to drag, but this bonus does not stack with the bonus from Greater Drag.
