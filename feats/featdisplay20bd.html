You draw upon your extraplanar heritage to imbue your weapons with elemental energies.

Prerequisites: Ifrit, oread, sylph, or undine.

Benefit:  As a swift action, you can imbue your weapons with elemental energy. For 1 round, your weapons deal an additional 1 point of energy damage. The type of energy damage depends on your race: acid for oread, electricity for sylph, fire for ifrit, or cold for undine. For every 5 levels you possess, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

Special:  You can use this feat instead of Arcane Strike to qualify for or attack with the Deadly Dealer feat (Pathfinder Player Companion: The Harrow Handbook 15).
