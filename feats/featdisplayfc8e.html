School Strike - Feats







School Strike (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 116</a>
You focus the secrets of your school of wizardry into your unarmed strike.

Prerequisites: Wizard school class feature, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike.</a>

Benefit:  When you gain this feat, choose one arcane school power that you can use to affect no more than one opponent. If you make a successful unarmed strike against an opponent, in addition to dealing your unarmed strike damage, you can use a swift action to deliver the effects of the chosen school power to that opponent. Doing so provokes no attacks of opportunity.

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, you apply it to a different qualifying arcane school power.

After hitting with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 stamina points to apply the effects of your chosen arcane school power as a free action instead of a swift action.
