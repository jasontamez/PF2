When wielding a melee weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you can make a single melee attack as a standard action against a foe. If the attack hits, you can select any number of foes within 30 feet who saw the attack, including that foe. Spend 2 stamina points per foe you have selected, then attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize those foes.
