Your creator was an aide and bodyguard, and your memories are filled with the sight of that charge.

Prerequisites: <a href="racesdisplay839b.html?ItemName=Shabti">Shabti</a>.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can designate an adjacent ally as your charge. So long as you remain adjacent to that character, he benefits from your resistance to level drain and immunity to undeath racial traits. This ability applies even if one of you is killed, so long as you remain adjacent.
