When you successfully strike your opponent with your Stunning Fist, you leave it in a state of confusion.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  You must choose to use this ability before making an attack roll with your Stunning Fist, and this effect replaces other effects or conditions that would be caused by Stunning Fist. If you successfully hit your opponent and it fails its Fortitude save, it becomes confused for 1 round. Additional disorienting blows to the confused target add to the duration of its confusion. This feat is otherwise subject to all of the limits and conditions of Stunning Fist.
