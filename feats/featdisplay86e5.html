Benefit:  Choose one weapon from the heavy blades or light blades fighter weapon group. While using this style, wielding the chosen weapon, and fighting defensively or using either the total defense action or the Combat Expertise feat, you gain a +1 shield bonus to your Armor Class. In addition, you do not take the penalty on melee attacks from Combat Expertise on the first attack roll you make each turn. You still take the penalty on additional attacks, including attacks of opportunity.

Special:  A character with the swashbuckler weapon training or weapon training (heavy blades or light blades) class feature can use Swordplay Style with any light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, heavy blade, or light blade, respectively, in addition to the chosen weapon.
