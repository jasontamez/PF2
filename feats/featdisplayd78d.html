You are adept at ripping away an opponent's mental mask, exposing its true visage during a psychic duel.

Prerequisites: Psychic Sensitivity or ability to cast psychic spells or use psychic spell-like abilities, character level 2nd.

Benefit:  While in a psychic duel, when you create an offensive manifestation that can be negated or halved only with a successful Will saving throw, if your opponent fails that Will saving throw, its mental mask is shattered, revealing the opponent's true form.

Special:  If you possess the Third Eye feat, your opponent's mental mask is shattered even on a successful Will saving throw.
