Disruptive Recall - Feats







Disruptive Recall

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 97</a>
You can disrupt an enemy caster's spells to fuel your own arcane power.

Prerequisites: Spell recall class feature, Spellcraft 5 ranks.

Benefit:  When you use a melee attack to successfully disrupt an arcane spellcaster's spell, you can immediately use your spell recall class feature to regain a magus spell you have already cast. This ability functions as if you had expended a number of points from your arcane pool equal to the level of the spell you disrupted, up to the maximum level spell you can cast.
