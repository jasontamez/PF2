Your mind drifts swiftly from one thing to the next and is all but impossible to pin down.

Prerequisites: Character level 9th, gathlain.

Benefit:  When you fail a Will save against a mind-affecting effect that lasts more than 1 round, you can attempt another Will save on the round after your failed save. If you succeed, you gain the normal benefits of succeeding at a Will save against the effect. This feat offers only one additional saving throw against each effect.
