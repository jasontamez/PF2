When you successfully deflect a ranged touch attack, you can spend 10 stamina points as a swift or immediate action to reflect the attack toward another target, which must be within 60 feet of you. The total distance from the original attacker, to you, and then to the new target cannot exceed the original attack's maximum range. You take a -5 penalty on the ranged touch attack to hit the new target. (See page 18.)
