Your heritage is strange or difficult to trace, and people fear your otherworldly powers.

Prerequisites: Fetchling.

Benefit:  You have the mysterious ability to see into the Shadow Plane, but only in your dreams. Once per day while sleeping, you can create a magical sensor, as arcane eye except this sensor can view only your current location as it exists on the Shadow Plane. This effect lasts for 1 minute per character level, and can be used during any point while you sleep.
