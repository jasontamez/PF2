Your painful stare overwhelms your foe's mind.

Prerequisites: <a href="classdisplayc100.html?ItemName=Mesmerist">Mesmerist</a> level 11th, painful stare class feature.

Benefit: Whenever you use your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become confused for 1 round. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours.
