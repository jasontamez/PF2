You have a special bond with slimes and oozes.

Prerequisites: Wild empathy class feature.

Benefit: You may target oozes with spells and special abilities that normally only affect animals as if the oozes were magical beasts with Intelligence 1, though they gain a +4 bonus to their saving throws. You may use wild empathy to influence oozes as easily as you influence magical beasts with Intelligence 1.
