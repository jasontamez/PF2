You can bounce ranged attacks off objects to obscure their point of origin and surprise foes.

Prerequisites: Dex 19, <a href="featdisplay45f6.html?ItemName=Blind-Fight">Blind-Fight</a>, <a href="featdisplay5a28.html?ItemName=Improved%20Precise%20Shot">Improved Precise Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit: You can choose to take a -2 penalty on a ranged weapon attack to ricochet it off a stone or metal surface and resolve the attack as if it originated from the chosen ricochet point for the purpose of determining cover (but not for determining concealment). Add the entire distance the weapon or ammunition traveled to determine range penalties for the attack. Bouncing a shot this way can potentially enable you to make ranged attacks against foes who have total cover against you by going around obstacles, but such a foe still has total concealment against your attack.
