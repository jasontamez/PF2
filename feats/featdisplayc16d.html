When you strike, you knock the sense out of smaller foes.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, <a href="featdisplay7e12.html?ItemName=Vital%20Strike">Vital Strike</a>, base attack bonus +6, giant subtype.

Benefit:  If you hit a creature at least one size category smaller than you with a melee attack while using both Power Attack and Vital Strike, the creature you attacked is also dazed for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates this effect (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus). You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll.

Special:  This effect stacks with the effect of Giant's Crush.
