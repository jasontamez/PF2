You can remove poison from afflicted creatures.


Benefit:  As a full-round action, you can remove an
injury poison from a helpless or willing creature's
bloodstream with a successful Heal check. The DC of
this check is equal to the poison's DC. You can only draw
out poison in this way within the first 2 rounds of when
the target was poisoned. If the check is successful, the
creature no longer suffers any additional effects from
the poison. By performing this action, you do not risk
poisoning yourself.
