You have learned the art of spellcasting while wearing signifer armor.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayfb3a.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Armor%20Mastery">Arcane Armor Mastery</a>, <a href="featdisplayf9fe.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Armor%20Training">Arcane Armor Training</a>, Heavy Armor Proficiency, caster level 7th, must swear allegiance to a single Hellknight order.

Benefit: As a swift action, you can reduce the arcane spell failure chance due to the armor you are wearing by 30% for any spells you cast this round. This benefit applies only if you are wearing armor with "Hellknight" in its name. This bonus replaces, and does not stack with, the bonuses granted by Arcane Armor Mastery, Arcane Armor Training, and similar feats and effects.
