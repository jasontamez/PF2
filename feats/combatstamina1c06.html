You can spend a number of stamina points equal to your Dexterity bonus while attempting combat maneuver checks. For every 2 stamina points that you spend in this way, you are considered to be one size category larger than your actual size when determining whether you can affect a target creature with your combat maneuver and when calculating your size bonus for that check.
