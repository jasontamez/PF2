From your earliest days, you were destined to sacrifice
everything in your quest for power.

Prerequisites: You must have had friendly contact
with an evil-aligned outsider that would qualify as a
challenging foe, have a fiend-related sorcerous bloodline
such as abyssal or infernal, have direct fiendish ancestry
(such as being a tief ling or half-fiend), or have the Fiend
Raised or The Fiend background (see Ultimate Campaign).

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Charisma-based
checks involving evil-aligned outsiders and +1 bonus to
the DC of spells and spell-like abilities you use against
such creatures. You take a -2 penalty on Charisma-based
checks involving good-aligned outsiders.

Goal: Successfully trade your soul to an evil outsider.

Completion Benefit: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus
to an ability score of your choice. This enhancement
bonus can't be dispelled or removed save by the direct
intervention of a deity, and counts as a supernatural
ability. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level
checks (including dispel checks and checks to bypass
spell resistance) against good-aligned outsiders. If you
die while under the effects of this agreement, you can't
be brought back from the dead unless the evil outsider
permits it. You lose your story benefits immediately and
permanently if you renege on the arrangement by which
you traded your soul, though you keep the feat's basic
benefits.


Suggested Traits: Domineering, History of Heresy,
Magical Flair.
