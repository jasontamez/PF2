As your allies' morale swells, your enemies falter.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaycdea.html?ItemName=Basic%20Harmony">Basic Harmony</a>, Compelling Harmony, Perform (keyboard, percussion, sing, string, or wind) 10 ranks, bardic performance or raging song.

Benefit:  When an ally with this feat is within 60 feet and uses a bardic performance or raging song that grants allies a morale bonus or competence bonus, you may perform the same bardic performance or raging song to increase those bonuses by +1. This increase only lasts as long as you and your ally each maintain the same performance, and cannot be extended with effects like Lingering Performance. Additional bards with this feat beyond the second don't increase the bonuses further.
