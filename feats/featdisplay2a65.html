Your unarmed strikes weave together in an effortless combo, focusing on the spots you've weakened with the last hit.

Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike; base attack bonus +6, brawler's flurry class feature, or flurry of blows class feature.

Benefit: Whenever you use a full-attack action or flurry of blows to make multiple attacks against a single opponent with unarmed strikes, total the damage from all hits before applying damage reduction. This ability works only with unarmed strikes, no matter what other abilities you might possess.

While using this style, you can spend 5 stamina points to pool all of your attacks as a standard action, instead of a full-round action.
