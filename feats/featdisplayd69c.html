You can modify your pattern spells to reduce their chance of affecting certain targets.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay408a.html?ItemName=Pattern%20Message">Pattern Message</a>, <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (illusion)</a>, caster level 7th.

Benefit: When you cast a spell from the pattern subschool, as a free action, you can choose a specific creature type or subtype to shield from the spell's full effects. Creatures of the selected type or subtype that are affected by the spell reduce the save DC of the spell by 4. At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, you can specify an additional creature type or subtype to protect (up to four protected types at 19th level). If a creature has multiple subtypes that you specified when casting your spell, the reduction in the spell's save DC stacks for each specified type or subtype. For example, if you specified the outsider creature type and the demon and evil subtypes, then your pattern spell's DC would be 12 lower for outsiders with the demon and evil subtypes.
