Created through rituals that suffused elemental fire with the dark corruption of shadow, shadowfire creatures were spawned from the evil cult led by Yarrix (see page 103). Cruelly transformed from their true forms by their ancient creators, they flicker between existence and nothingness, reality and oblivion, feeding on pain and flame and the screams of those who dare stand against them.

"Shadowfire creature" is an inherited template that can be applied to any creature that has the shadow creature template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 238) and 5 or more Hit Dice, referred to hereafter as the base creature. It retains all the special abilities of the base creature, except as noted here.

CR: Same as the base creature + 1.

Type: The shadowfire creature gains the elemental and fire subtypes if it does not already have them. Do not recalculate the creature's base attack bonus, saves, or skill ranks.

Defensive Abilities: A shadowfire creature gains immunity to fire and cold, and loses any vulnerability it has to fire or cold. In addition, a shadowfire creature gains the following defensive abilities.

Fire Absorption (Su): A shadowfire creature regains 1 hit point for each point of fire damage it would take from normal fire, a flaming weapon, or magical fire were it not immune. Any hit points gained above the shadowfire creature's full normal hit point total are temporary hit points that disappear after 5 minutes.

Incorporeal Step (Su): When a shadowfire creature moves, it gains the incorporeal subtype and special ability, including a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus. It loses the incorporeal subtype and special ability when it stops moving.

Special Attacks: A shadowfire creature gains the following special attack.

Shadow Touch (Su): A shadowfire creature's touch chills the target and saps away its life energy. All of a shadowfire creature's slam attacks and attacks with natural weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of negative energy damage to living creatures.

Spell-Like Abilities: A shadowfire creature can use the shadow step spell (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 237) as a spell-like ability once per day, with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice. If it has 11 or more Hit Dice, it can instead use this ability three times per day.

Ability Scores: Str +2, Dex +2, Cha +4.
