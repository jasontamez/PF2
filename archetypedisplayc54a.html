Totem guides embody the wisdom and spirituality of the natural world, providing guidance as well as aid in combat. Once a totem guide is chosen, a character can replace the companion if it is slain but must choose the same kind of totem guide.

Spiritual Guidance (Sp): At 3rd level, a totem guide can use guidance as a spell-like ability at will as a full-round action, targeting itself or its master. In addition, a totem guide's master can spontaneously cast the following spells while adjacent to the totem guide by sacrificing a spell slot of equal or higher level: detect animals or plants (1st), augury (2nd), helping hand (3rd), divination (4th), commune with nature (5th), and find the path (6th). The totem guide serves as a divine focus for these spells, but costly material components must still be provided.

This replaces evasion.

Beast Speech (Ex): At 6th level, a totem guide can speak with its master as though the two share a common language, and it can speak with other animals of its species (or, at the GM's discretion, other creatures with similar types).

This replaces devotion.

Eldritch Claws: At 9th level, a totem guide gains Eldritch Claws as a bonus feat.

This replaces Multiattack.

Ghost Guardian (Ex): At 15th level, a totem guide's natural weapons deal full damage to incorporeal creatures, and its natural armor bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks. A totem guide can never be transformed into or animated as an undead creature.

This replaces improved evasion.
