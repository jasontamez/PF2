Thematically, monsters with higher mental ability modifiers are the most likely to have cunning combat options.

Ability Damage: Attacks by this monster deal 1d2 points of damage to one ability score. This can apply to all the monster's attacks, apply only to its weapons, or function as a melee touch attack. This damage increases to 1d4 at CR 5, 1d6 at CR 10, 1d8 at CR 15, and 2d6 at CR 20. Alternatively, the attack can deal damage to two ability scores, but uses the damage value for a creature 5 CR lower. The attack could instead deal ability drain (rather than ability damage), but uses the damage value for a creature 5 CR lower.

Blind-Fight: The monster rolls miss chances due to concealment twice and takes the higher result.

Bombs: As a standard action, the monster creates a bomb and throws it with a range of 20 feet. Use the throw splash weapon special attack. On a direct hit, the bomb deals fire damage equal to the monster's low weapon damage, using 3d6 damage dice. Splash damage is 6 + 1/2 the monster's CR.

Challenge: Once per day as a swift action, the monster can challenge one target within sight. The monster gains a bonus on melee damage rolls equal to its CR (minimum 1) against that creature, but takes a -2 penalty to AC against attacks made by creatures other than the target. The target remains challenged until it is killed, falls unconscious, or the combat ends. The monster can use this ability three times per day at CR 5, and at will at CR 14.

Combatant's Touch: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to grant that creature a bonus equal to 1 + 1/2 the monster's CR on melee attack rolls. Additionally, choose one physical ability modifier. This bonus applies on combat maneuver checks, skill checks, and ability checks that use that ability modifier.

Constant Invisibility: Because of its natural appearance or an exterior effect, such as a cloak of invisibility, this monster is invisible at all times. If this ability is used below CR 10, it should be for monsters that aren't focused on combat.

Fast Feint: The monster can attempt a Bluff check to feint as a move action.

Favored Enemy: Choose a creature type, or a single subtype of humanoid or outsider. The monster gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures of that type. Increase the bonus and number of creature types chosen based on the monster's CR: +4 and two types at CR 4, +6 and three types at CR 9, +8 and four types at CR 14, and +10 and five types at CR 19.

Improved Combat Maneuver: Choose a type of combat maneuver. The monster doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when using that maneuver, its CMB for that type of maneuver increases by 4, and its CMD increases by 4 against that type of maneuver. You can choose one of the monster's attack types. If you do, whenever the monster hits with an attack of that type, it can automatically attempt a combat maneuver of the type chosen with this option.

Mage Killer: The DC to cast defensively when threatened by this monster increases by 4. Casters that fail attempts to cast defensively provoke attacks of opportunity from this monster.

Mage Punisher: Whenever an enemy within the monster's reach successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster after the spell is complete.

Poison: The monster uses poison with its attacks, either through a natural weapon or by applying the poison to a particular manufactured weapon. The target of a successful attack with the chosen weapon must attempt a Fortitude save to resist the poison. The basic poison is type injury,

onset 1 minute, frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes, effect 1d2 points of damage to any one ability score (chosen when the monster gains this option), cure 1 save. Choose two of the following additional advantages, plus one advantage for every 3 CR the monster possesses: decrease onset to -, change the frequency to 1/round for 6 rounds, increase the ability damage to 1d3 points of damage (this option can be chosen multiple times to increase the damage to 1d4, 1d6, and 1d8), damage an additional ability score (using the same damage die as the primary ability damage effect), increase the cure to 2 consecutive saves.

Repositioning Attack: When it hits a creature of its size or smaller with a certain type of attack, the monster can immediately attempt a reposition combat maneuver check to push or pull that creature. Its CMB for this check increases by 4. The distance the monster pushes or pulls the creature can increase under certain conditions, such as if the monster has special appendages.

Sneak Attack: When flanking or attacking a foe denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, this monster deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 CR the monster possesses. Decrease the base damage of the monster's attacks by 2 points for every 1d6 of sneak attack it has.

Team Fighter: The monster gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against targets that are threatened by one of the monster's allies (other than itself ). This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 CR the monster possesses.

Trap Squares: The monster can trap any square adjacent to it as a standard action. Any creature that enters the trapped square takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the monster's CR of a damage type chosen by the monster while setting the trap. The trap is invisible and lasts for a number a rounds equal to the monster's CR. It can be found with a successful DC 25 Perception check and disarmed with a successful DC 25 Disable Device check. The monster can create three traps per day; at CR 10, this increases to five traps per day. This ability can be used for mundane or magical traps. For mundane traps, choose bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage; for magical traps, choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage.

Unflankable: The monster can't be flanked.
