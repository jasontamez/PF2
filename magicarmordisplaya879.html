Description

A suit of spell dodging armor makes it more difficult for attacks from spells and spell-like abilities to hit its wearer, often physically pulling and pushing its wearer out of the way of incoming magical attacks. The wearer gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC against attack rolls from spells and spelllike abilities (including touch attacks) and the attacks of summoned creatures.
