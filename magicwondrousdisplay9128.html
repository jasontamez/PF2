Description

When burned, this stick of incense releases a sharp smell and fills the surrounding air with bright orange and golden motes. A creature that lights this incense (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and breathes the smoke for 1 minute gains the fire subtype for 1 hour. This grants the creature immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold for the duration of the effect. The price listed is for a single stick of incense, which is enough for only one creature to use and benefit from as described.
