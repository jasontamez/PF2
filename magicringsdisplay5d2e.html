Description

This ring allows its wearer to persevere through physical or mental trauma that hampers his actions. Once per day, when the wearer gains the staggered condition from an enemy's attack, she can ignore that condition for up to 5 rounds. This does not prevent her from gaining the staggered condition again, and it does not protect her if she gained the staggered condition multiple times.
