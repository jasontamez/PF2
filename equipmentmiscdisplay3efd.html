Description

When first opened, this sealed jar releases such an overwhelmingly antiseptic odor that it covers other smells until it disperses (1d6 rounds after opening). Creatures within 20 feet of the jar get a +5 alchemical bonus on all saves against scentbased attacks while the sap's odor remains, but they automatically fail any scent-based Perception checks during that time.

Construction
