A shaman with this totem calls upon the cunning serpent, the stealthy deceiver who draws the weak minded in and strikes while they are unaware. Some hate its treacherous nature, while others praise its thoughtful pragmatism.

Nature Bond:  A serpent shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a snake. If choosing a domain, the serpent shaman must choose from the Animal, Charm, Trickery, and Water domains.

Wild Empathy (Ex):  A serpent shaman can use wild empathy with reptiles as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.

Totem Transformation (Su):  At 2nd level, a serpent shaman may adopt an aspect of the snake while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (climb speed 20 feet, swim speed 20 feet), scales (+2 natural armor bonus to AC), senses (low-light vision, scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4], poison [frequency 1 round (6), effect 1 Con damage, Cure 1 save, Con-based DC] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to grapple). While using totem transformation, the serpent shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (reptiles only) at will.

Totemic Summons (Su):  At 5th level, a serpent shaman may cast summon nature's ally as a standard action when summoning snakes, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.

Wild Shape (Su):  At 6th level, a serpent shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level - 2. If she takes on the form of a snake, she instead uses her druid level + 2.

Bonus Feat:  At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a serpent shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Combat Expertise, Improved Feint, Skill Focus (Bluff), Stealthy, or Strike Back. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.
