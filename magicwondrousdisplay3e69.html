Description

This fizzy, sky-blue liquid leaves its drinker feeling buoyant, yet bloated. The drinker gains a +4 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made to make high or long jumps and on Swim checks for up to 1 hour after consuming the elixir. As a standard action, the drinker can exhale a 15-foot-long gust of wind. The drinker can exhale up to three gusts, after which the elixir's effect is discharged and the skill bonuses end. Unused gusts dissipate after 1 hour.
