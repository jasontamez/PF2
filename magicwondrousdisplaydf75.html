Description

A rope of entanglement looks just like any other hempen rope
about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward
20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled
creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20
Escape Artist check.


A rope of entanglement has AC 22, 12 hit points, hardness
10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. The rope repairs damage
to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a rope of
entanglement is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is
destroyed.
