Versatile Summon Nature's Ally

You've learned to summon a wider array of creatures.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc78d.html?ItemName=Augment%20Summoning">Augment Summoning</a>, <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (conjuration)</a>, Knowledge (nature) 1 rank, Knowledge (planes) 1 rank.

Benefit:  When you summon one or more animals, humanoids, or vermin using a summon nature's ally spell (or an effect that mimics such a spell), instead of granting them the benefit from Augment Summoning, you can instead apply one of the following templates to them: aerial, aqueous, chthonic, fiery, or primordial. If you summon multiple creatures with one casting, they must all have the same template.
