Description

This armor allows the wearer to capitalize on her own injuries to heal her allies. Once per day as an immediate action, when an enemy confirms a critical hit against someone wearing martyring armor, the wearer can heal up to nine allies within 30 feet as if using the mass cure light wounds spell (1d8+9 hit points each). This special ability cannot be placed on armor that possesses an ability that reduces the chance of or negates a critical hit (such as the fortification special ability).
