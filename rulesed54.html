Skilled survivalists and trappers are adept at fashioning effective, if simple, traps from humble materials. A wilderness trap has an associated terrain wherein the raw materials for the trap are commonplace. Within these associated terrains, the base cost of each trap is calculated in sp rather than gp. Wilderness traps always have a CR of 5 or lower.

When in a trap's associated terrain, instead of paying one-third the item's price in raw materials, the trap maker can attempt a Survival check against the normal Craft DC of the trap + 2 ?? the trap's CR. If successful, the trap maker finds the necessary materials in the wild after 1d4 hours of foraging + 1 hour per CR of the trap. She can then attempt a Craft (traps) check, also at the normal Craft DC + 2 ?? the trap's CR, to build the trap, which takes another 1d4 hours + 1 hour per CR of the trap. Traps built with such crude materials don't last long without maintenance; they have a cumulative 20% chance to break for every day they go without being tightened and reset (which requires 10 minutes of work but no additional skill checks).

At the GM's discretion, other nonmagical mechanical traps may be considered to have associated terrains and use the wilderness trap construction rules. <ul><li><a href="trapsfbab.html?ItemName=Breakaway%20Vine">Breakaway Vine</a></li> <li><a href="trapsd0f5.html?ItemName=Musk%20Shower">Musk Shower</a></li> <li><a href="traps3ca1.html?ItemName=Spring%20Snare">Spring Snare</a></li> <li><a href="traps2db7.html?ItemName=Swinging%20Log">Swinging Log</a></li> <li><a href="traps8dc7.html?ItemName=Tar%20Snare">Tar Snare</a></li> <li><a href="traps6fd9.html?ItemName=Clam%20Clamp">Clam Clamp</a></li> <li><a href="trapsb088.html?ItemName=Razor%20Grass">Razor Grass</a></li> <li><a href="traps7b78.html?ItemName=Breakaway%20Log">Breakaway Log</a></li> <li><a href="trapsb0b8.html?ItemName=Spring-Arm%20Spike">Spring-Arm Spike</a></li> <li><a href="traps9b0c.html?ItemName=Deadfall">Deadfall</a></li></ul>
