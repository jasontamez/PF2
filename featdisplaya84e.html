Your thrown weapons become pure light, overcoming enemy defenses.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay708e.html?ItemName=Lantern%20Style">Lantern Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a>, good or lawful alignment, caster level 7th or monk level 7th.

Benefit: When you make a single ranged attack with a thrown weapon, that weapon temporarily transforms into pure holy light, overcoming the target's damage reduction, if any.
