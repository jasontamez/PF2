Hexing Attack (minor): You can touch one weapon and enhance it to inflict a minor curse on the next target it strikes. The struck target must succeed at a Will saving throw or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or ability checks (warpriest's choice) for 1 minute.

Retributive Curse (major): At 10th level, as a swift or immediate action, you can inflict a curse on any adjacent creature that scores a critical hit against you or deals precision damage to you. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be cursed. Select one of the following effects: the target takes a -2 penalty to one ability score of your choice (the ability cannot be reduced below 1); the target takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks; each turn, the target has a 25% chance of taking no action (otherwise, it acts normally). This curse lasts for 1 hour. A creature can be subjected to only one instance of retributive curse at a time. This otherwise functions as bestow curse.
