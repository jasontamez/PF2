Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This rugged leather baldric can hold one weapon in its sheath and has pockets sufficient to hold one of the following (or gear of an equivalent volume): two cases of bolts, one quiver of arrows, or 40 bullets or firearm cartridges. The wearer, as well as each item held in the baldric, gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws against the effects of primal magic (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 12). When a Garundi wearer attempts a concentration check to prevent a primal magic event from triggering, she gains a +2 competence bonus on the check; she can attempt the check even if she is not a spellcaster, treating her effective caster level as 5 and applying the highest of her Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma modifiers.
