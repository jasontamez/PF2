Description

Typically worn by senior members of a faith, these cumbersome but splendidly ornate garments create an aura of dignity and gravitas that few dare to challenge. When activated, the garments make you seem more impressive and worthy of respect to all viewers within 60 feet of you; you may make a single Diplomacy check to change the attitudes of these viewers as a swift action. You can only use this ability on a particular viewer once per day (additional attempts have no effect, though you can still persuade viewers normally without the help of the focus).
