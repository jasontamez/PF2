Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a>, any one performance feat.

Benefit:  You can make performance combat checks in any combat. When making a performance check outside of performance combat, you can pick a single performance feat to use. You automatically gain any bonus on the performance combat check the feat grants, and then you make a DC 20 performance combat check. On a success, you gain the full effect of the performance feat you chose.
