Some druids believe that dragons are the ultimate expression of nature, combining elemental fury with majestic beauty. These druids consort with dragons and eventually transform into draconic forms.


Drake Companion
: A draconic druid gains a drake companion instead of an animal companion.

This ability replaces nature bond, wild empathy, woodland stride, venom immunity, a thousand faces, and timeless body.


Dragon Sense: A draconic druid studies dragons and their history. She gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) checks.

This ability replaces nature sense.


Resist Dragon's Might: A draconic druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of dragons.

This ability replaces resist nature's lure.


Dragon Shape: A draconic druid can't use wild shape to change into any of the usual forms available to a druid. Instead, at 4th level, she can use wild shape to change into a dragon-scaled version of herself with long fangs, gaining a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC and a bite attack appropriate for her size (1d6 points of damage for a Medium druid) but otherwise retaining her usual form. At 10th level, she can spend two uses of wild shape to transform into a Medium dragon as per form of the dragon I, and at 12th level, she can spend two uses to change into a Large dragon as per form of the dragon II. Each time that a draconic druid uses wild shape counts as a separate casting of the spell for the purpose of refreshing her uses of her breath weapon.
