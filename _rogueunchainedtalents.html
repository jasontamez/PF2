Talents - Rogue (Unchained)









Rogue Talents


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained</a>
As a rogue gains experience, she learns a number of talents that aid her and confound her foes. Starting at 2nd level, a rogue gains one rogue talent. She gains an additional rogue talent for every 2 levels of rogue attained after 2nd level. A rogue cannot select an individual talent more than once.

Some talents add effects to a rogue's sneak attack. Only one of these talents can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.



Sneak Attack Talents


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Armor Piercer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s7z">Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 9</a>): A rogue with this talent can cause her sneak attacks to pierce through natural armor. When she hits with an attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo one or more of her sneak attack dice to reduce the target's natural armor bonus by that amount (minimum natural armor bonus of +0) until the end of her next turn. A creature cannot be affected by this ability again for 1 minute.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bleeding Attack (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 20</a>): A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue's sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Distracting Attack (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can make sneak attacks with subtle flourishes that disorient and distract her enemy. When she hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she can forgo the additional damage to cause the creature to become flat-footed against one target of her choosing until the beginning of her next turn. The rogue cannot designate herself as the creature gaining the benefit of this talent. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to distracting attack.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Emboldening Strike (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws for every 2 sneak attack dice rolled (minimum +1) for 1 round.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Extinguishing Strike (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, any nonmagical light sources worn or carried by the creature (such as lit torches, lanterns, or sunrods) are automatically extinguished. Once per day, the rogue can use this ability to also attempt a dispel check (as per dispel magic) against any magical sources of light a target carries, using her rogue level as the caster level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Focusing Attack (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  When a rogue selects this talent, she must choose the confused, shaken, or sickened condition. When the rogue has the selected condition and hits a creature with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage, the rogue no longer has that condition. A rogue can take this talent up to three times. Each time, she must select a different condition that she is able to remove from herself with a melee attack that deals sneak attack damage. Even if the rogue has taken this talent multiple times, she can remove only a single effect on herself with each melee attack that deals sneak attack damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Obscuring Blow (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  Once per day, the rogue can forgo her potential to deal sneak attack damage to attempt to cloud an opponent's vision. She must declare the use of obscuring blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage but, instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and any effect that triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack damage), the target treats all other creatures as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls for a number of rounds equal to half the rogue's level. A successful Fortitude saving throw reduces this effect to 1 round. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence modifier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Powerful Sneak (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  Whenever a rogue with this talent takes a full-attack action, she can take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. If she does, she can reroll any sneak attack damage dice that result in 1s. She can reroll multiple dice, but she can't reroll any individual die more than once per attack.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sever Alignment (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x05?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms">Distant Realms pg. 13</a>): When making a sneak attack against an opponent with an alignment subtype, a rogue with this talent can forgo her sneak attack damage to scramble the creature's metaphysical nature. If the attack succeeds, the rogue deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence modifier) or lose all damage reduction overcome by aligned weapons (such as DR 10/good), lose all regeneration overcome by aligned sources (such as regeneration 10 [good]), and lose the ability to cast spells and use spell-like abilities with alignment descriptors for 1 round for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage the rogue would have dealt (minimum 1 round). The rogue must have the aligned sneak attack talent to select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shadow's Chill (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  When a rogue with this talent hits a creature with a melee weapon that deals sneak attack damage, a number of points of the damage dealt equal to the number of sneak attack dice rolled is cold damage. The remainder of the sneak attack damage and the normal weapon damage are unaffected. The rogue must have cold resistance from a racial trait before selecting this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Silencing Strike (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide">Adventurer's Guide pg. 53</a>): Using magic stolen from the Hellknights, Council agents can render foes silent. When a creature is damaged by the rogue's sneak attack, the rogue magically renders the creature mute for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the rogue's level + the rogue's Charisma modifier). Silencing strike can be used a number of times per day equal to half the rogue's level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Slow Reactions (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  Opponents damaged by the rogue's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Underhanded (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon. Furthermore, if she makes a sneak attack during the surprise round using a concealed weapon that her opponent didn't know about, she does not have to roll sneak attack damage, and the sneak attack deals maximum damage. A rogue can only use the underhanded talent a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). </td>
</tr>

Other Talents


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Accurate Poisoner (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xa4?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Potions-Poisons">Potions and Poisons pg. 13</a>): A rogue with this talent delivers poisons with deadly precision. When the rogue successfully hits an opponent with a poisoned weapon and would deal sneak attack damage, she can forgo the sneak attack damage and increase the poison's potency. If she does, the poison's duration increases by 2 (for example, large scorpion venom lasts for 8 rounds instead of 6 rounds, and drow poison lasts for 4 minutes instead of 2 minutes).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Aligned Sneak Attack (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9x05?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Realms">Distant Realms pg. 13</a>): When making a sneak attack against a creature that has damage reduction that can be overcome by weapons of a particular alignment (such as DR 5/good), the rogue's attack reduces that damage reduction by an amount equal to the number of sneak attack dice rolled until the end of the rogue's turn.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ambuscading Grapple (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s7z">Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 9</a>): When a rogue with this talent succeeds at a combat maneuver check to grapple an unaware opponent, she can immediately deal her sneak attack damage to the target. This counts as having hit with a sneak attack for the purpose of other abilities and talents.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Aspexia's Mysticism (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide">Adventurer's Guide pg. 53</a>): The rogue has been trained in a minor occult technique. The rogue gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Assault Leader (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  Once per day, when the rogue misses with an attack on a flanked opponent, she can designate a single ally who is also flanking the target that her attack missed. That ally can make a single melee attack against the opponent as an immediate action.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bardic Pretender (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9wmy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-City-in-the-Lions-Eye">Pathfinder #130: City in the Lion's Eye pg. 76</a>): The rogue knows enough about music and performance to survive in a bardic college and can fake what she doesn't know. The rogue qualifies as having the <a href="classdisplayaec9.html?ItemName=Bard">inspire competence bardic performance class feature</a> for the purpose of meeting prestige class requirements, although this talent doesn't grant her the bardic performance ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Black Market Connections (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains better access to magic items from black market connections. She treats every settlement as one size greater for the purpose of determining the gp limit of the base value of items for sale, as well as the number of minor, medium, and major magic items for sale in the settlement. If the settlement is already a metropolis, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful Diplomacy check, the rogue can treat the settlement as two sizes larger. If the settlement is already a metropolis and she succeeds at the check, all magic items are for sale. If the settlement is already a large city and she succeeds at the check, all minor and medium magic items are for sale, as well as 3d8 major magic items. With a successful check, the rogue can also sell stolen items on the black market. If the check fails by 5 or more, the rogue does something to spook the market, and treats the city as normal for 1 week. Furthermore, those in control of the black market may alert the authorities to the rogue's presence in an act of reprisal for spooking the market or to divert attention away from their illicit activities. The DCs of the checks are by settlement size and are given in the table below.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Community Size</td><td> DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Thorp</td><td> 10</td></tr> <tr><td>Hamlet</td><td> 12</td></tr> <tr><td>Village</td><td> 15</td></tr> <tr><td>Small town</td><td> 18</td></tr> <tr><td>Large town</td><td> 20</td></tr> <tr><td>Small city</td><td> 25</td></tr> <tr><td>Large city</td><td> 30</td></tr> <tr><td>Metropolis</td><td> 35</td></tr></table></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Camouflage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>): A rogue with this talent can craft simple but effective camouflage from the surrounding foliage. The rogue needs 1 minute to prepare the camouflage, but once she does, it is effective for the rest of the day or until the rogue fails a saving throw against an area-effect spell that deals acid, cold, or fire damage, whichever comes first. The rogue gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks while within terrain that matches the foliage used to make the camouflage. This ability cannot be used in areas without natural foliage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Canny Observer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  When a rogue with this talent makes a Perception check to hear the details of a conversation or to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps), she gains a +4 bonus.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Careful Stab (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide">Adventurer's Guide pg. 53</a>): When a rogue with this talent reduces a creature to fewer than 0 hp with precision damage, she can choose to leave that creature at -1 hp and stable.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Castling (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qyb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Elemental-Masters-Handbook">Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 9</a>): The rogue treats soft cover granted by creatures of her size or larger as though it were cover instead. Cover the rogue gains from this talent does not allow her to attempt Stealth checks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Certainty (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  The rogue chooses one of the skills she selected with rogue's edge (see page 23). Once per day, the rogue can reroll a skill check she just made with the selected skill and take the better result. She can use this reroll with the selected skill one additional time per day at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter. A rogue can select this talent multiple times. Each time, the rogue must choose a different skill. A rogue must have the rogue's edge class feature before selecting this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Claimed Turf (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l37/discuss&amp;page=5?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Intrigue">Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 32</a>): The rogue is well known in a specific community in which she gains the benefits of renown. She gains the renown vigilante social talent (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 12). This community can be an entire settlement or portions of a settlement (such as a particular district or neighborhood), depending on the population as allowed by the renown social talent. Anytime she could select another rogue talent, the rogue can also select from the following list of social talents (from pages 10-13 of Ultimate Intrigue), using her rogue level as her vigilante level for the purpose meeting of prerequisites: celebrity discount, celebrity perks, gossip collector, great renown, incredible renown, loyal aid, and safe house. For the purposes of vigilante social talents, the rogue does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cloying Shades (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 7</a>):  When a rogue with this talent uses dimension door as a spell or spell-like ability, including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature, then all creatures adjacent to the rogue at the start and end of her teleportation are entangled by grasping shadows for 1 round (although the creatures are not anchored in place). A successful Reflex saving throw negates this effect. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). The rogue must have dimension door as a spell or spell-like ability (including the abundant step or shadow jump class feature) before choosing this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Coax Information (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  A rogue with this talent can use Bluff or Diplomacy in place of Intimidate to force an opponent to act friendly toward her. When the duration of the attitude shift ends, that opponents' attitude toward the rogue returns to its previous level, rather than dropping one level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Combat Swipe (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she is treated as if she met all the prerequisites for Greater Steal (although she must take the feat as normal).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Combat Trick (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  A rogue who selects this talent gains a bonus combat feat.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cunning Trigger (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can use a swift action to set off any trap within 30 feet that she constructed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dampen Presence (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 27</a>): A rogue who selects this talent gains Dampen Presence (Pathfinder Player Companion: Dungeoneer's Handbook 10) as a bonus feat. The rogue does not need to meet the feat's prerequisites. The rogue is also considered to have the Skill Focus (Stealth) feat for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisites of any feat that lists Dampen Presence as a prerequisite.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Deft Palm (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can make a Sleight of Hand check to conceal a weapon while holding it in plain sight, even while she is being observed. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Developed Poison Immunity (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9cro?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Wild">Heroes of the Wild pg. 21</a>): When this talent is taken, select a single animal or plant poison that the rogue has been poisoned with but survived. The rogue automatically succeeds at all Fortitude saves against exposure to the selected poison.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eerie Disappearance (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ghc?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Streets">Heroes of the Streets pg. 26</a>): As a full-round action, the rogue can move up to her speed. If she successfully reaches a location that offers her cover or concealment, any creature observing her must attempt a Perception check opposed by the rogue's Stealth check. On a failed check, the observer loses track of the rogue and fails to note where she moved to. The rogue does not take a penalty on this Stealth check for moving up to her speed. At the end of her movement, the rogue can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 60 feet who were aware of her at any point during her movement and are unaware of her current location. She rolls the Intimidate check only once and compares her result to the DC for each opponent. The rogue must be at least 6th level to select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eldritch Conduit (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 7</a>): Survival in the Mana Wastes between the nations of Nex and Geb can depend heavily on locating sufficient magical equipment, which sometimes involves stealing power from a wand or scroll to power a more necessary one. As a full-round action, a rogue with this talent can use two potions, two wands, or two scrolls. Each item is expended or loses a charge as if used normally. The rogue chooses to gain the magical effect of one, but calculates its effects using the caster level of the other. The rogue must still succeed at a Use Magic Device check to operate scrolls or wands unless some other ability allows him to do so, but makes only one skill check to operate both items.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Esoteric Scholar (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  A rogue with this talent can attempt any Knowledge skill check, even if she is not trained in that Knowledge skill.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Expert Cypher (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 7</a>): A rogue with this ability can attempt a Linguistics check to decipher a single page of text as a full-round action instead of taking 1 minute as normal. In addition, when the rogue attempts a Use Magic Device check to cast a spell from a scroll, she is treated as though she had the minimum score in the appropriate ability score to cast that spell. Finally, the rogue can choose to add her Intelligence modifier to her Use Magic Device skill checks instead of her Charisma modifier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Expert Leaper (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  When using the Acrobatics skill to jump, a rogue with this talent is always considered to have a running start and adds her rogue level to the check result. Whenever she deliberately falls, a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check allows her to ignore the first 20 feet fallen. For every 5 by which she exceeds the DC of this check, she can ignore an additional 10 feet of distance fallen.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Extra Earthcraft (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qyb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Elemental-Masters-Handbook">Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 9</a>): The rogue gains 2 additional earthcraft points each day. The rogue must have the earthcraft ability to select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>False Attacker (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ghc?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Streets">Heroes of the Streets pg. 26</a>): Whenever the rogue strikes a foe from hiding, she can attempt a Bluff check as an immediate action (opposed by the target's Sense Motive or Perception check, whichever has a higher bonus) before rolling damage to convince the foe that another creature was the attacker. This Bluff check applies the normal modifiers for convincing a creature of a falsehood, but can be accomplished with just physical trickery (a shared language is not required). If the Bluff is successful, and the rogue maintains concealment or cover, the rogue's stealth does not end.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fast Getaway (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  After successfully making a sneak attack or Sleight of Hand check, a rogue with this talent can spend a move action to take the withdraw action. She can move no more than her speed during this movement. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fast Stealth (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  This ability allows a rogue to move at full speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Favored Terrain (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9cro?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Wild">Heroes of the Wild pg. 21</a>): The rogue selects one terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list; she gains this as a favored terrain, as the ranger class feature. If the rogue also has or later takes the hide in plain sight advanced talent (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 71), her favored terrain must match a terrain she has selected for that advanced talent. If the rogue has ranger levels, her effective ranger level is equal to her ranger level + 5 for purposes of improving the bonuses from this favored terrain and gaining new favored terrains. A rogue must be at least 5th level to select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Feint from Shadows (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  A rogue with this talent can feint in combat using a ranged weapon against a target within 30 feet and cause the opponent to lose his Dexterity modifier against her next melee or ranged attack. The rogue must have concealment (but not full concealment) from the target of the feint.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Firearm Training (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms). </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Follow Along (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue">Ultimate Intrigue pg. 44</a>): A rogue with this talent is familiar enough with enchantment magic to fool it, using spellcasters' complacency to set them up for a surprise attack. Whenever she succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment effect, the rogue learns the spell's effect on a failed save, allowing her to play along and pretend to have failed her save. If she does so, the spellcaster does not learn that she succeeded at her saving throw, even if she was the only target, though she must succeed at an opposed Bluff check against a spellcaster's Sense Motive check to determine whether she is under the enchantment's effects. While this ruse is in place, the spellcaster is flat-footed against the rogue's first attack. If the spellcaster sees the rogue perform (or fail to perform) an action that would be impossible if she were under the enchantment's effect, he automatically discovers her ruse.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Follow Clues (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  A rogue with this talent can use Perception to follow tracks as per the Survival skill.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fortified Position (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qyb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Elemental-Masters-Handbook">Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 9</a>): Whenever the rogue gains a bonus on Reflex saves due to cover, she gains an equal bonus on Fortitude saves.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Getaway Artist (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent adds Fly, Handle Animal, and Ride to her list of class skills, and gains a +2 bonus on all driving checks. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Gloom Magic (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains the ability to cast darkness two times per day as a spell-like ability. The darkness created by this ability does not impair the rogue's vision. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. A rogue must have an Intelligence score of at least 12 and the minor magic rogue talent before choosing this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Greater Gloom Magic (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains the ability to cast deeper darkness once each day as a spell-like ability. The darkness created by this ability does not impair the rogue's vision. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. A rogue must have an Intelligence score of at least 13 and the gloom magic and minor magic rogue talents before choosing this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Green Tongue (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9cro?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Wild">Heroes of the Wild pg. 21</a>): The rogue gains Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Giant, Ignan, Sylvan, or Terran as a bonus language. In addition, the rogue can attempt a DC 15 Linguistics check to communicate basic concepts with magical beasts and monstrous humanoids with which she does not share a common language.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Grit (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains the Amateur Gunslinger feat and one grit feat of her choice. She must fulfill the prerequisites of the grit feat in order to choose it. A rogue must have the firearm training talent before choosing this one. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hairpin Trick (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide">Adventurer's Guide pg. 53</a>): The rogue is skilled at making do with anything she can find. She takes no penalty on Disable Device checks for using improvised tools, and can attempt such checks without any tools at a -4 penalty. She treats all non-improvised thieves' tools as masterwork and doubles the bonus she gets from masterwork thieves' tools from +2 to +4.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hold Breath (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  A rogue with this talent doubles the amount of time she can hold her breath.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Innocent Facade (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 27</a>): Once per day, a rogue with this talent can use innocence as a spell-like ability, using her rogue level as the spell's caster level. A rogue must have the minor magic talent before selecting this talent. An investigator can select the innocent facade rogue talent in place of an investigator talent. She must have the underworld inspiration investigator talent before selecting this talent, instead of minor magic.</td>

<td>Innocuous Servant (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l37/discuss&amp;page=5?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Intrigue">Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 32</a>): The rogue is an expert at appearing to be an unimportant servant, be it an attach??, bodyguard, driver, maid, kitchen assistant, or similar staff member. The rogue gains a +2 bonus on Disguise checks to appear to be a servant, but not to impersonate a particular servant. She also gains a +2 bonus on Bluff checks to lie to maintain this guise. While disguised as a servant, she gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information among servants. Because she is easily overlooked as a servant, she can gather information from those she serves without asking them questions directly or alerting them to her interest. Doing so takes 1d4 days and requires a successful Bluff check instead of a Diplomacy check. At 8th level, the bonuses granted by this talent increase to +4.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Iron Guts (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent has a cast-iron stomach or has trained herself to withstand poisons, especially ingested ones.

<td>Knockout Queen (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide">Adventurer's Guide pg. 53</a>): Sabriune has passed on the secret of swiftly manufacturing drow poison. Once per day, the rogue can create 1 or more doses of drow poison by spending 25 gp per dose; this process takes 30 minutes of work, regardless of the number of doses she creates. She can create no more than 1 dose for every 3 rogue levels she has (minimum 1 dose). Creating drow poison in this way does not require a skill check, but the created poison spoils if not used within 24 hours. (This spoilage means that selling doses of this poison for a profit to unsuspecting merchants might well result in unwanted repercussions and reprisals!)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Lasting Poison (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 21</a>):  A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a weapon in such a way that it is effective for a number of successful attacks equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum two) instead of one. This poison has a reduced effect, however, and saves made against the poison gain a +2 circumstance bonus. Applying poison in this way is a full-round action, or a standard action if the rogue has the swift poison rogue talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ledge Walker (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  This ability allows a rogue to move along narrow, uneven, or slippery surfaces (such as ice) at full speed using the Acrobatics skill without penalty. In addition, a rogue with this talent is not flat-footed when using Acrobatics to move along such surfaces, and retains her Dexterity bonus to AC.</td>

When she delivers a contact or injury poison, instead of the poison's normal onset time, the rogue can delay the poison's effects until up to 1 day from when it is delivered (minimum 1 round). The delayed poison can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and similar abilities.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Minor Magic (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains the ability to cast a 0-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. This spell can be cast at will as a spell-like ability. The rogue's caster level for this ability is equal to her rogue level. The save DC for this spell is 10 + the rogue's Intelligence modifier. A rogue must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 to select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Multitalented (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  The rogue can use her rogue talents more often. Once per day, she can use a rogue talent that is normally only usable once per day one additional time. At 10th level and 18th level, she can use this talent one additional time per day (for a maximum total of 3 additional uses of a rogue talent that can normally only be used once per day). The uses of this talent do not have to be spent on the same rogue talent. This ability cannot be used with an advanced talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Nimble Climber (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  Whenever the rogue fails a Climb check by 5 or more, she can attempt a Reflex save (using the same DC as the Climb check) to catch herself and avoid falling.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ninja Trick (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can choose a trick from the ninja trick list. The rogue cannot choose a ninja trick with the same name as a rogue talent. The rogue can choose but cannot use talents that require ki points, unless she has a ki pool. A rogue can pick this talent more than once. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Occult Dungeoneer (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 7</a>): Street thieves in Absalom expect wares to be securely locked, and sometimes it takes high-quality tools and magic training to ensure there's a meal at the end of the day. A rogue with this ability can use spell-trigger and spell-completion items as if the following spells were on a spell list to which he has access: detect secret doors, detect traps, knock, locate object, and obscure object. If the spell-trigger device allows a wielder to apply his own caster level (such as with a staff ), the rogue may use his class level as his caster level. The rogue may also use knock as a supernatural ability once per day, using his rogue level as his caster level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>One of Those Faces (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2w?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Spymasters-Handbook">Spymaster's Handbook pg. 21</a>): Each day, you can use disguise self as a spell-like ability for up to 10 minutes per character level. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 10-minute increments. Additionally, once you have used this ability, whenever you use it for the next 24 hours you must take the same alternate appearance.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Poison Use (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  The rogue is trained in the use of poison, and can't accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.</td>

The movement must end in a space adjacent to the creature hit with the melee attack. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Quick Disable (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  It takes a rogue with this ability half the normal amount of time to disable a trap using the Disable Device skill (minimum 1 round). When she uses Disable Device to open a lock that would normally take a full-round action to open, she reduces the duration to a standard action.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Quick Disguise (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can use the items at hand and seemingly innocuous material hidden on her person to create startlingly effective disguises, reducing the amount of time it takes to create a disguise using the Disguise skill.

The time needed for the rogue to alter her appearance in this manner is based on the complexity of the disguise, as noted on the following table. The times are cumulative, so if a female rogue wants to disguise herself as a male of a different race, that takes 2 minutes.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Disguise</td><td> Time</td></tr>  <tr><td>Minor details only</td><td> 1 full-round action</td></tr>  <tr><td>Disguise as a different gender</td><td> 1 minute</td></tr>  <tr><td>Disguise as a different race</td><td> 1 minute</td></tr>  <tr><td>Disguise as a different age category</td><td> 1 minute</td></tr>  <tr><td>Disguise as a different size category</td><td> 1 minute</td></tr></table></td>

To do this, she must purchase the components, spend the required time constructing the trap in advance, and have its components at hand. The type of trap that can be constructed in this way is subject to GM discretion.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rapid Perception (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 27</a>): A rogue with this talent can attempt a Perception check to intentionally search for a specific item or creature as a swift action instead of a move action. If she is intentionally searching for an invisible creature, the creature's bonus on its Stealth check from its invisibility is halved. An investigator can select this rogue talent in place of an investigator talent. She must have the expanded inspiration investigator talent before selecting this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Resiliency (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  Once per day, a rogue with this ability can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice her rogue level. Activating this ability is an immediate action that can be performed only when the rogue is brought to below 0 hit points. This ability can be used to prevent the rogue from dying. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. If the rogue's hit points drop below 0 due to the loss of these temporary hit points, she falls unconscious and is dying as normal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rogue Crawl (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  While prone, a rogue with this ability can move at half speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. A rogue with this talent can take a 5-foot step while crawling, and she reduces her attack roll and AC penalties for being prone by 2.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rope Master (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this ability can move at her normal speed when using rope on a Climb check, can take 10 when using Acrobatics to move over narrow surfaces even when in danger or distracted, and gains a +4 bonus when determining the DC to escape bonds when she ties up a creature.</td>

This talent wards the rogue and any objects she is holding or carrying. An investigator can select this talent in place of an investigator talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Scrying Familiarity (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2w?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Spymasters-Handbook">Spymaster's Handbook pg. 23</a>): You are well acquainted with scrying sensors. You can roll twice and take the better result on saving throws against divination (scrying) spells and effects, on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors, and on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance when you use a scrying spell or effect. If you notice a magical sensor, you can attempt a Stealth check opposed by the caster's caster level check to avoid being detected by the sensor.</td>

<td>Sczarni Smuggler (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l37/discuss&amp;page=5?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Intrigue">Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 32</a>): The rogue has picked up Sczarni tricks for making masterful forgeries and using bribery to evade trade rules. The rogue needs to learn only the approximate appearance of a document that doesn't require a particular person's signature to accurately forge the document with Linguistics (gaining a +8 bonus on the check to create the forgery, as if she had seen a similar document before). The rogue needs only a small sample of a person's handwriting to make a convincing forgery of great length in that person's handwriting. The rogue can always take 10 on Diplomacy checks to offer bribes. In addition, the rogue automatically gains an extra advantage at the start of a pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142) in an urban environment.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shades of Gray (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue">Ultimate Intrigue pg. 44</a>): A rogue with this talent uses mental and emotional tricks to protect herself from attempts to discern her alignment.

</tr><tr>
<td>Shadow Duplicate (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  Once per day as an immediate action when the rogue is hit, the rogue can create a single shadow duplicate of herself, as per mirror image. The GM randomly determines whether the attack hit the rogue or the shadow duplicate. The shadow duplicate lasts for a number of rounds equal to the rogue's level, or until the shadow duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. This ability does not stack with the mirror image spell. The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. A rogue can use this ability one additional time per day for every 5 rogue levels she has.</td>

<td>Sneak Training (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9wmy?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-City-in-the-Lions-Eye">Pathfinder #130: City in the Lion's Eye pg. 76</a>): The rogue counts as having the sneak attack class feature of a rogue of her level for the purpose of meeting prestige class requirements, although this talent doesn't improve the rogue's existing sneak attack ability or grant her the sneak attack class feature if she doesn't already have it. This talent is most useful for rogues that lack the sneak attack class feature, such as those with the <a href="archetypedisplay6a1d.html?FixedName=Rogue%20Phantom%20Thief">phantom thief</a> archetype.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spell Storing (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 7</a>): The rogue can store within himself a single targeted harmless spell of up to 2nd level. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action. Anytime a spell that meets these conditions is cast on the rogue, and he does not already have a spell stored, he can choose to store it rather than have it take effect immediately. Anytime afterward, as a standard action, the rogue can have the spell take effect (acting in all ways as if it had just been cast on him). A rogue must have 1 rank of Use Magic Device to select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stand Up (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  A rogue with this ability can stand up from a prone position as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity, or as a free action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</td>

<td>Strong Impression (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  A rogue who selects this talent gains Intimidating Prowess as a bonus feat. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Strong Stroke (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent rolls twice when making Swim checks and takes the better result. If she already rolls twice while making a Swim check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus on both of those rolls instead. If the rogue is under the effect of a spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making Swim checks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Superior Sniper (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 27</a>): A rogue who selects this talent gains Expert Sniper (Dirty Tactics Toolbox 10) as a bonus feat. If she already has this feat, she can instead select any feat that lists Expert Sniper as a prerequisite, as long as she meets the feat's prerequisites. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Suppress Poison (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xa4?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Potions-Poisons">Potions and Poisons pg. 13</a>): A rogue with this talent can stave off the effects of a poison. As an immediate action when she fails a saving throw against a poison, the rogue can attempt the saving throw a second time. If she succeeds at this second saving throw, the poison does not affect her for a number of rounds equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round), but this time it counts against the poison's duration. This talent has no effect on poisons with an onset longer than immediate.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Surprise Attack (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  During the surprise round, a rogue with this ability always considers opponents flat-footed, even if they have already acted. A rogue with this ability adds 1/2 her rogue level to her sneak attack damage rolls made during the surprise round.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Survivalist (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent adds Heal and Survival to her list of class skills.</td>

<td>Swift Poison (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can apply poison to a weapon as a move action, instead of a standard action.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Swift Tracker (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9cro?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Wild">Heroes of the Wild pg. 21</a>): While following tracks, the rogue can move at her normal speed without penalty while using the Survival skill.

</tr><tr>
<td>Terrain Mastery (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains a favored terrain, as the ranger class feature of the same name (Core Rulebook 65), but the bonus does not increase with her level. A rogue can select this talent multiple times, each time applying it to a new terrain.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>The Whole Time (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 7</a>): Mercenaries in the employ of the Aspis Consortium often use wands of invisibility to attack protected targets, then blend into the crowd to escape or disguise the source of the next attack. A rogue with this ability is practiced at attacking from magical concealment. He can use spell-trigger and spellcompletion items as if the following spells were on a spell list to which he has access: greater invisibility, invisibility, and vanish<sup>APG.

Additionally, if the rogue becomes visible as a result of a weapon or spell attack, he can sheathe his weapon as a free action and instantly adopt a neutral posture. With a successful Bluff or Disguise check (opposed by witnesses' Sense Motive or Perception checks, whichever is higher), there is no obvious sign that the rogue is the source of the attack (though a lack of any other reasonable candidate can still lead observers to draw the correct conclusion).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Thrill of the Chase (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l37/discuss&amp;page=5?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Intrigue">Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 32</a>): The rogue revels in the thrill and adrenaline rush of a challenging chase. When engaged in a chase (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232) or pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142), the rogue gains one d20 reroll which she can use at any time after the original roll is made but before the results of the roll are revealed; she must take the second result, even if it is lower. She can use this reroll once per chase or once per day during a pursuit. Additionally, she gains Run as a bonus feat.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Toxic Regurgitation (Ex)
(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xa4?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Potions-Poisons">Potions and Poisons pg. 13</a>): A rogue with this talent can drink a noninhaled poison as a standard action and suspend it within her body. She is not affected by the poison while it is suspended within her, and she doesn't need to attempt saving throws against it. She can suspend a poison within herself in this way for a number of hours equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1), after which she must immediately expel the poison or be affected by it as normal. At any time while the poison is suspended within her, the rogue can spit up the poison as a ranged touch attack at any creature within 10 feet. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. On a successful hit, the struck creature is exposed to the poison as if it were a contact poison. The rogue can maintain only a single suspended poison at a time. If she suspends a new poison, any older suspended poison immediately affects her as normal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Trap Spotter (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  Whenever a rogue with this talent comes within 10 feet of a trap, she can attempt an immediate Perception check to notice the trap. This check should be made in secret by the GM.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Umbral Gear (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  As a standard action while in an area of dim light or darkness, a rogue with this talent can coalesce wisps of shadow into a quasi-real, functional item. The rogue must choose whether to make a crowbar, 50 feet of silk rope, a glass cutter, a light melee weapon with which she is proficient, a reversible cloak, thieves' tools, or a wire saw; the GM may allow other similar items. The rogue can use such items for a number of minutes per day equal to 10 plus her rogue level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

An item created with this ability remains until the rogue is no longer touching it, or until the rogue runs out of duration for this talent, at which time it dissolves. A rogue can select this talent more than once, gaining an additional 10 minutes of duration each time this talent is selected. If a rogue has selected this talent at least twice, she adds 50 feet of silk rope with a grappling hook, a masterwork light melee weapon with which she is proficient, and masterwork thieves' tools to the list of things she can create.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Unbalancing Trick (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qyb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Elemental-Masters-Handbook">Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 9</a>): The rogue gains Improved Trip as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. At 6th level, she is treated as if she meets all the prerequisites of Greater Trip (although she must take the feat as normal to gain its benefits).</td>
</tr><tr>

At 6th level, she is treated as if she meets all the prerequisites for Greater Dirty Trick (although she must take the feat as normal). If she succeeds in giving her target the blinded condition, the target cannot remove the condition during the first round of blindness.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Wall Scramble (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent rolls twice when making Climb checks and takes the better of the two rolls. If she already rolls twice while making a Climb check because of another ability or effect, she gains a +2 insight bonus on both of those rolls instead. If the rogue is under the effect of a spell or ability that forces her to roll two dice and take the worse result, she only needs to roll 1d20 while making Climb checks. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Weapon Training (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 22</a>):  A rogue who selects this talent gains Weapon Focus as a bonus feat.</td>

The caster level for this ability is equal to the rogue's level. A rogue must have the major magic rogue talent to select this advanced talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Double Debilitation (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24</a>):  Whenever the rogue inflicts a penalty against a target using the debilitating injury class feature, she can select two penalties to inflict. The target can never be subject to more than two penalties in this way at one time. If any additional penalties are inflicted, any previous penalties immediately end. Any effect that heals damage to the target negates both of the penalties.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Aligned Disguise (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 8</a>):  When a rogue with this talent uses the disguise self spell-like ability, she can also alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as detect evil) for the duration of the disguise self effect. She can choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. The rogue must have disguise self as a spell-like ability before choosing this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Another Day (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  Once per day, when the rogue would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a melee attack, she can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. If the movement takes her out of the reach of the attack, she takes no damage from the attack. The rogue is staggered for 1 round on her next turn.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blinding Strike (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 9</a>):  A rogue who selects this talent gains Blinding Critical as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites. The rogue must have the obscuring blow rogue talent and be at least 15th level before choosing this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Cutting Edge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 23</a>):  A rogue with this ability immediately selects two additional skills with her rogue's edge ability. She can select this advanced talent multiple times.</td>

These can be separate poisons, in which case they both affect the target individually, or two doses of the same toxin, in which case the poisons' frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This talent is an exception to the rule that injury poisons can only be delivered one dose at a time.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Defensive Roll (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 23</a>):  The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. When she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If she succeeds, the rogue takes only half damage from the blow; if she fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll; if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since such damage would not normally allow a character to attempt a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Familiar (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent gains a familiar as the familiar option of the wizard's arcane bond class feature.

Once per day, she can choose a skill in which she has no ranks. After she spends 10 minutes communing with these mystical spirits, they grant her a luck bonus equal to her rogue level with that skill, and she can attempt checks with that skill as if she were trained in its use. The effects of founder's blessing last for 8 hours.</td>
</tr><tr>

</tr><tr>
<td>Grazing Shot (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9he0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Agents-of-Evil">Agents of Evil pg. 24</a>): The following rogue talent is available to drow rogues. Particularly deft rogues can
strike two foes with one well-placed shot. As a
standard action, a rogue with this talent can fire a
hand crossbow at an enemy who is granted cover
by another opponent. Make one ranged attack
roll and compare the result to each opponent's
AC. Each hit deals 1 point of damage. Any
special weapon properties or precision
damage apply to only a single target, but
any poison applied to the bolt affects all
targets struck. An unchained
rogue can select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hidden Mind (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue">Ultimate Intrigue pg. 44</a>): A rogue with this talent uses various devious techniques, including mental exercises and dusting her clothing with a small amount of lead, to protect herself from divinations, with the same benefits as if she cast nondetection on herself with a caster level equal to her rogue level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hide in Plain Sight (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can select a single terrain from the ranger's favored terrain list. She is a master at hiding in that terrain, and while within that terrain, she can use the Stealth skill to hide, even while being observed. A rogue may take this advanced talent more than once, each time selecting a different terrain from the favored terrain list.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hunter's Surprise (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  Once per day, a rogue with this talent can designate a single enemy she is adjacent to as her prey. Until the end of her next turn, she can add her sneak attack damage to all attacks made against her prey, even if she is not flanking it or it is not flat-footed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Improved Evasion (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24</a>):  This works like evasion, except while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack, she also takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Knock-Out Blow (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  Once per day, the rogue can forgo her sneak attack damage to attempt to knock out an opponent. She must declare the use of knock-out blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage, but instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and instead of any effect that triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack damage), the target falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this effect to staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence modifier.</td>

<td>Multitalented, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24</a>):  A rogue with this talent can use the multitalented rogue talent to gain additional uses of advanced talents. A rogue must have the multitalented talent to select this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Opportunist (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24</a>):  The rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as an attack of opportunity for that round and can't be used more than once per round.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pierce the Darkness (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ghc?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Streets">Heroes of the Streets pg. 26</a>): The rogue can extend her senses of hearing and smell in darkness or when blinded. She gains blindsense out to a range of 5 feet, but only against creatures concealed by darkness or her own blindness. She still suffers the normal miss chance for attacking creatures with concealment.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Quick Shot (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24</a>):  Whenever the rogue rolls initiative, she can also make a single attack with a ranged weapon as a swift action. She can use this ability only if she has a weapon in hand and it is loaded (if applicable). If more than one rogue has this talent, their initiative check results determine the order in which they make their attacks. After these attacks are resolved, the round proceeds as normal.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Redirect Attack (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  Once per day, when a rogue with this talent is hit with a melee attack, she can redirect the attack to strike at an adjacent creature with a free action. The creature targeted must be within melee reach of the attack that hit the rogue, and the creature that made the attack against the rogue must make a new attack roll against the new target. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Reflexive Shadow Shield (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 9</a>):  Once per day as an immediate action, the rogue can gain an amount of cold resistance or electricity resistance equal to half the rogue's level. This resistance lasts for 1 round. If the rogue has the shadowy resistance racial trait, the cold or electricity resistance stacks with the resistance that trait grants; otherwise, the energy resistance does not stack with any cold or electricity resistance the rogue has. The rogue must have the resiliency rogue talent before choosing this talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rumormonger (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can attempt to spread a rumor though a small town or larger settlement by making a Bluff check. She can do so a number of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4 days. A failed check means the rumor failed to gain traction, while failing by 5 or more causes the opposite of the rumor or some other competing theory involving the rumor's subject to take hold.

</tr><tr>
<td>Shrinewalk (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sjo?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Adventurers-Guide">Adventurer's Guide pg. 53</a>): Council agents can walk the mystic paths between Westcrown's shrines. A rogue with shrinewalk can create her own shrine simply by designating an area in any urban region by placing a unique marking or rune on a wall or the ground. This marking is not magical, and if it is defaced or erased, it can no longer be used by the rogue (the marking can be hidden from view without removing its usability, including painting over the marking in question). Once placed, the rogue can use word of recall once per day to return to the shrine. A rogue can maintain one shrine at a time; if a new marking is created in a new location, the previous shrine becomes inactive.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Skill Mastery (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24</a>):  The rogue becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. The rogue selects a number of skills equal to her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of the selected skills (or any of the skills selected through the rogue's edge class feature), she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue can gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for skill mastery to apply to each time.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Slippery Mind (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24</a>):  This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She can attempt only one additional saving throw against any given effect using this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stalker Talent (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6p?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Intrigue">Ultimate Intrigue pg. 44</a>): The rogue can select a vigilante talent. For the purposes of selecting and using this talent, she counts as a 10th-level vigilante with the stalker specialization, regardless of her actual rogue level. Her sneak attack counts as a hidden strike with reduced damage for the purpose of determining the effects of her vigilante talent, which means, among other things, that she can't apply any of the vigilante talents marked with an asterisk (*) to her sneak attacks.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stealthy Sniper (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1</a>):  When a rogue with this talent uses the Stealth skill to snipe, she only suffers a -10 penalty on the Stealth check, instead of -20. </td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Unlock Ki (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 27</a>): A rogue with this advanced talent increases the number of points in the ki pool that she gains from the ki pool rogue talent to be equal to 1/2 her rogue level + her highest mental ability score modifier (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). In addition, she can spend 2 points from her ki pool as a swift action to gain the skill unlocks (Pathfinder Unchained 82) for one skill of her choice as appropriate for her number of ranks in that skill. This benefit lasts for 1 minute. The rogue must have a ki pool before selecting this advanced talent.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Unwitting Ally (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 1</a>):  A rogue with this talent can spend a swift action to attempt to make an opponent act like an ally for purposes of providing a flank until the beginning of the rogue's next turn. The opponent must be able to hear and see the rogue, and the rogue must succeed at a Bluff check opposed by the opponent's Sense Motive. If the check succeeds, the opponent acts as an ally for the purpose of providing a flank. Whether or not the check succeeds, the rogue cannot use this trick again on the same opponent for the next 24 hours. If the rogue fails the check by 5 or more, she cannot use the unwitting ally ability on any opponent within line of sight of the failed attempt for 24 hours. </td>
</tr><tr>
