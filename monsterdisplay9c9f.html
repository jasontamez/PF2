Special Abilities

Sucking Maws (Su) A dark young of Shub-Niggurath that successfully pins a creature it is grappling automatically inflicts 1d4 points of Strength drain on that creature. A DC 24 Fortitude save reduces this effect to 1 point of Strength drain. A creature drained to 0 Strength does not die, but must make a DC 24 Will save at that point to resist being driven mad by the experience, as the foul green waste exuded from the same sucking mouths that drink life implant in the emptied shells strange visions and horrifying certainties. If you use the GameMastery Guide in your game, this madness manifests as schizophrenia, but with a save DC equal to the dark young's Strength drain save DC listed above (DC 24 for most dark young). One common result of this unfortunate madness is a strange desire to return to the site of their original encounter in hopes of being consumed entirely by the creature that only drank a part of their body and mind-many of those who survive this horrific ordeal go on to found dark young cults of their own. If you don't use the GameMastery Guide in your game, treat this madness instead as an insanity spell. The madness element of a dark young's sucking maws is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC for all of the saving throws involved with this special ability is Constitution-based.

Description

The Elder God known in whispered circles as Shub- Niggurath is reputed to have a thousand young, when in fact her spawn are myriad. Yet some of her children are more fecund and successful than others, and the monstrosities known as her dark young are perhaps the best known of this legion of monstrosities.

In combat, a dark young usually starts by using entangle and command plants to seize control of the surrounding terrain-its ability to constantly use freedom of movement affords it mobility through such regions, allowing it to move through the areas and select its prey with ease. Intelligent and canny, dark young know that spellcasters are more difficult to affect with insanity, and save that spell-like ability for use against rogues, fighters, and similar foes. Flight offers no guarantee of safety from the dark young, for they can pursue their foes through the air as surely as across land.
