Effect By hiding lengths of sharpened sticks or bones amid undergrowth (traditionally tall grass; when used in coastal or underwater areas, this trap is instead called a razor kelp trap), the trapper can lay a simple but effective trap. Whenever a creature moves into a square that contains razor grass, it takes 1d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or its speed is halved for 24 hours or until it receives magical healing or benefits from a successful DC 15 Heal check.
