Description

A cave dweller's greataxe appears to be a thin slab of stone crudely lashed to a bone haft. It's as serviceable as a metal weapon of the same type would be, and functions as a +1 greataxe. Once per day when the wielder of a cave dweller's greataxe hits a creature, the wielder can speak a command word to force the hit creature to attempt a DC 16 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it becomes slowed for 1 round. At the end of that round, the creature is no longer slowed, but it must succeed at a second saving throw or it becomes petrified for 1d4 rounds.
