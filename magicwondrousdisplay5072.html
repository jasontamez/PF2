Description

This single, seamless glove of gray calfskin is fitted with silver finger bones, covering the wearer's hand snugly yet stretching to accommodate movement. Once per day, the wearer of a glove of strength-stealing may spend a free action to activate a chill touch effect, as per the spell. Any Strength damage inflicted by the wearer's touch for the 6 rounds it remains in effect is added to his Strength score as an enhancement bonus (to a maximum of +6). This bonus fades 1 hour after the glove is activated.
