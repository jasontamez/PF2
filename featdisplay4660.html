You are a native of the wide and endless prairie, savanna, or steppe.

Prerequisites: Favored terrain (plains) class feature.

Benefit: You and a mount you are riding gain a +2 bonus on Constitution checks to avoid damage and fatigue from hustling or a forced march. In plains terrain, this bonus is doubled and also applies on Survival checks to avoid getting lost, to find food and water, to protect yourself from severe weather, and to predict the weather.
