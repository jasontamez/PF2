Description

Bound in bloodstained leather, this heavy tome is scarred like
the flesh of a seasoned warrior and contains many generations
of martial knowledge. Once per day, after studying the manual
for 1 hour, a fighter may exchange one of her fighter bonus
feats for another combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites
for this new feat and she cannot alter a feat she is using as a
prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability.
This change persists for 24 hours, after which time the fighter's
feats return to normal. The fighter may spend 10 minutes
studying the manual to end its effects early.
