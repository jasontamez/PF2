Shifter - Classes







Dwarf (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 31</a>): Add a +1/2 bonus on wild empathy checks to influence animals and magical beasts that are normally encountered in underground environments.
Elf (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 31</a>): Add 1 to the shifter's base speed. This has no ingame effect unless the shifter has selected this reward five times (or any multiple of five) to enhance her speed by 5 feet. For example, a 4th-level elven shifter who has selected this option four times has a base speed of 34 feet, but is treated as if she still had a base speed of 30 feet. When she reaches 5th level and takes this favored class option again, her base speed becomes 35 feet. This bonus applies only when the shifter is wearing no armor.
