There's something oddly wrong about aberrant companions. Yet though they're touched by eldritch magic or mutated by strange influences, they are still loyal, if unnatural, allies.

Aberrant Skills: Aberrant companions treat Escape Artist and Intimidate as class skills.

Not Quite Animal: The DC to use Handle Animal on an aberrant companion is 5 higher, as if it were a nonanimal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2.

Aberrant Sight (Ex): An aberrant companion gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

This replaces share spells.

Alien Mind (Ex): At 6th level, an aberrant companion is immune to mind-affecting effects that specifically target animals, such as charm animal. Anyone who attempts to use such an effect against it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (Will DC 20 half ).

This replaces devotion.

Fluid Bones (Ex): At 9th level, an aberrant companion gains compression as per the universal monster rule, though it can use the ability while carrying a rider only if the rider has compression.

This replaces Multiattack and the +2 natural armor increase at 9th level.
