Description

This iron staff, silvered and inlaid with diamonds, curves at one end like a shepherd's crook. It functions as a +1/+1 quarterstaff and grants an additional +2 bonus on drag and reposition combat maneuvers. However, its true power is to summon and command invisible forces, allowing the use of the following spells. <ul><li>Spiritual weapon (1 charge)</li><li>Spiritual ally (2 charges)</li><li>Summon monster VI (3 charges, invisible stalker only)</li></ul> Both the spiritual weapon and spiritual ally gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage, and any spiritual weapon or spiritual ally created by the crook is invisible as per greater invisibility, gaining the usual benefits when attacking creatures are unable to see it.

The wielder of a crook of unseen forces can spend 1 or more charges as a standard action to create an invisible wave of force in a 30-foot line. This wave of force attempts a drag, reposition, or trip combat maneuver (wielder's choice) against one creature in this line for each charge expended. This special combat maneuver check does not provoke attacks of opportunity and uses the better of the wielder's Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifiers in place of his Strength modifier to his CMB.
