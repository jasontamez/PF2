Description

A master's lash is a Large +5 flaming burst whip. In addition to the fire damage caused, any creature struck by a master's lash also takes 2d6 points of burn damage; this burn damage can be resisted with a successful DC 19 Reflex save. Three times per day, the wielder of a master's lash can command it to burn away the target's will to resist commands as well. Activating this is a free action-the target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or it takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves for 24 hours. These penalties can stack, and are a curse effect.
