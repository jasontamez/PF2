Description

This bizarre fruit appears to be carved from stone, though it has a lovely aroma and is easily consumed. Stone fruits occasionally sprout from the strange treelike monument known as the Celwynvian Charge (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments 29), where they are gathered by licensed vendors and sold to travelers. Eating a stone fruit hardens flesh and restores vitality. When a creature eats the fruit as a fullround action that provokes attacks of opportunity, it immediately recovers 2d6 hit points and gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its natural armor for 1 minute.
