Description

This +1 animal-bane boar spear has a wide crossbar engraved with symbols depicting an open hand. The boar spear increases the shield bonus to AC against a charging opponent hit with the spear by 2. If the dinosaur-killer is set against a charging foe and hits that foe, the wielder can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against the charging opponent as an immediate action after the charge attack is resolved. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
