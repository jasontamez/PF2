Description

A shield with this ability rings loudly when struck in combat. As an immediate action when the wearer is hit by an attack, the wearer can activate the shield to create a deafening bang equivalent to a thunderstone. If the attack is a critical hit, the wearer can instead create a sound burst (Fortitude DC 13 partial). The wearer decides the area for either effect, but must include the attacker in the area. Neither ability affects the wearer.
