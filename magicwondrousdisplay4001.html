Description

This belt functions as a serpent belt, except it grants the
wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity.
Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours
the belt is worn. When the wearer animates the belt as a
venomous or constrictor snake, she may speak a second
command word to give the snake the advanced, celestial,
entropic (Bestiary 2), fiendish, or resolute (Bestiary 2)
simple template. Adding a planar template changes the
snake's alignment to that of the corresponding planes.
