Your kinetic blast can drain your foes' vitality to replenish your own. If your blast hits (or the enemy fails its saving throw against a blast without an attack roll), you can activate the void healer utility wild talent on yourself by accepting its burn cost; you don't need to take an action to do so. The void healer utility wild talent heals you when used in this way even if you are a living creature.
