Like an archon's aura, the light of your thrown weapons can shake even the fiercest of foes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya84e.html?ItemName=Lantern%20Light">Lantern Light</a>, <a href="featdisplay708e.html?ItemName=Lantern%20Style">Lantern Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a>, good or lawful alignment, caster level 11th or monk level 11th.

Benefit: Creatures you hit with a thrown weapon as well as creatures within 20 feet of your target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier) or become shaken until they damage you or 24 hours have passed. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw or that damages you after becoming shaken becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.
