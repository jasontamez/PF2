Description

This ability can be placed only on a corrosive or corrosive burst weapon (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 138). When the wielder of a catalytic weapon hits a creature, the weapon triggers a devastating chemical reaction that burns the struck creature. The creature struck must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save, or take 1d6 points of acid damage at the start of its turn for 1d4 rounds. Successive hits with the catalytic weapon increase the duration but don't add to the damage. The creature can attempt to neutralize the reaction as a full-round action as if it were on fire (including bonuses for dropping and rolling on the ground or jumping into water). Anyone who hits a creature subject to this chemical reaction with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of acid damage.
