Description

This kit contains items to assist a courtesan in soothing the body and mind. For the body, the kit contains a razor, scented oils and salves, fragrances, a warming pot, and a variety of appealing outfits. Books of poetry, literature, and plays-often focusing on salacious topics and full of double entendres-entertain the mind.
