Description

This delicate tin music box can
produce a great volume of noise
at a specific time determined by
its owner. Four command words
determine what sorts of sounds it
is to play (battle, fire, massacre,
or riot), and a fifth determines the delay (anywhere from 1
round to 20 minutes) until the box begins to produce the desired
sound. The noise from the box is as loud as 40 people. The sound
persists for 2d6 rounds.
