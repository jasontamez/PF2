The force of your firearm strikes can drive back your foe or damage a second target.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay14f2.html?ItemName=Stock-Striker%20Style">Stock-Striker Style</a>, base attack bonus +7, pistol-whip gunslinger deed.

Benefit: When you are using Stock-Striker Style and successfully knock a target prone with the pistol-whip deed, as a swift action you can either push the target 5 feet away from you or perform the pistol-whip deed a second time against a foe that is adjacent to the first and within your reach. This second use of pistol-whip costs 0 grit points.
