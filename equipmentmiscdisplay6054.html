Description

Made with dragon's gall, which is harvested from a recently
deceased dragon's liver, Dahak's fire is a volatile alchemical
reagent. Though inherently inert, the substance ignites when
it comes into contact with fast-moving air, which makes it ideal
for application to blades or arrows. When applied to a weapon
or piece of ammunition as a standard action, the weapon deals
an extra 2d6 points of fire damage on the next successful hit.

The Dragoncrafting feat and a successful DC 20 Craft
(alchemy) check are required to convert 1 vial of dragon's
gall into 1 application of Dahak's fire.
