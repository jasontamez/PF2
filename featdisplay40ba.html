You can move easily with a grappled enemy in tow.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaye2e3.html?ItemName=Grabbing%20Style">Grabbing Style</a>, Improved Grapple; base attack bonus +8, brawler level 4th, or monk level 4th.

Benefit:  When you are using Grabbing Style, if you use the move grapple action, you can move both yourself and a single target that you're grappling your full speed instead of half your speed. After you have done so, you can use a move action to move yourself and the target of your grapple half your speed without needing to attempt an additional combat maneuver check. You cannot use this feat if you are grappling two targets.

After using the move grapple action and moving your full speed, you can spend 5 stamina points to move your full speed again (instead of half your speed) without the need to attempt another grapple check.
