You can augment your channeled energy in new ways.

Prerequisites: Channeling Variance or variant channeling ability, channel energy class feature.

Benefit: You gain one additional variant channeling ability that matches one of your deity's domains, subdomains, or areas of concern. Three times per day, you can apply the modifications of this variant channel energy, reducing the damage dealt or healing performed by your channeled energy as normal. You cannot apply more than one variant channeling ability to your channeled energy at once.

Special: You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, you gain another variant channeling ability. If you have chosen Channeling Variance twice, you can use any variant channeling ability chosen with this feat whenever you channel energy.
