Description

A merging shield can meld with a held one-handed or light weapon. The wearer chooses each round whether to attack with the weapon or defend with the shield. Melding or freeing the shield requires a command word. The shield must be worn to merge it with a weapon; reversing the melding means the shield is being worn again. While the shield is melded, the wearer can use that hand only to attack with the weapon or defend with the shield (and not to cast spells or manipulate objects, for example). Attack rolls with the weapon take a -2 penalty while merged with a light shield or a -4 penalty while merged with a heavy shield. If the wearer attacks with the merged weapon, she loses the shield's bonus to AC until the start of her next turn. A merged shield can't be used to shield bash. Only light and heavy shields can be merging shields.
