Tactics

Before Combat The druid casts barkskin and cat's grace. She casts endure elements every morning.
During Combat The druid keeps her distance from opponents. She casts freedom of movement, then wild shapes into an air elemental to fly away. Once she feels she has the tactical advantage, she relies on summon spells and ranged abilities to avoid melee.

Sasrukutenek

Sasrukutenek sells water at a trade stop on the overland route between two desert cities. She overcharges for this commodity, but since it's so scarce, her customers have very little choice.
