Description

A shield with this special ability is crafted to resemble an angel or other outsider holding a basin of some sort, and is engraved with holy symbols. The shield is keyed to either positive or negative energy when it is crafted. If the bearer can channel energy of the keyed type, three times per day he can increase the total number of dice of channeled energy by 1. The wearer also reduces any damage taken from energy of the type opposed to the keyed type by 10 points.
