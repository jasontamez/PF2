Remember that you're preparing so that things proceed smoothly at the game table. Over-preparation can ruin that. Instead, prepare just enough so that you can quickly deal with situations that you expect to arise, and so that you can handle the unexpected. Don't script your game so tightly that the players lose their sense of freedom or that your game's whole structure falls apart if your players fail (or refuse) to accomplish what you expect them to.

Likewise, don't create so many notes that you can't keep them organized. One page for each major encounter, event, or personality is generally plenty, and often less will do.
