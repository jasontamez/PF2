Description

The end of this +1 viridium long lash tail
attachment is a shard of toxic green
rock. As with any viridium weapon, a
successful hit with an irradiating tail causes
the target to contract leprosy-and a critical
hit can poison the target with greenblood
oil. However, unlike with most viridium weapons, the wielder of an
irradiating tail is magically immune to the weapon's toxic effects.
The viridium has been strengthened, so the weapon isn't fragile.
