In this system, the bonus a magic item grants corresponds to the item's starting market price as it appears in the item's original statistics. This price is shown on each table in this section in the "Starting Price" column. The second column shows the value of the bonus at a particular price range, and the header indicates to which statistics the bonus applies. In addition, any item that gains an innate item bonus also increases its market price by the amount shown on each table's "Price Increase" column.

For example, a belt of dwarvenkind isn't a popular choice, since players typically want a belt of giant strength +4 or similar item for close to the same price. When using innate bonuses, items such as the belt of giant strength-which only grants an enhancement bonus-wouldn't exist, and the belt of dwarvenkind would count as a body slot item (see the <a href="rules7c2d.html?Name=Wondrous%20Items&amp;Category=Innate%20Item%20Bonuses">Altered Item Slots section under Wondrous Items</a>). Since it costs 14,900 gp in the Core Rulebook, it would grant a +2 bonus to two ability scores in addition to its usual effects, and cost an additional 10,000 gp, for a total of 24,900 gp.

The price increase means that a significant range of prices doesn't come into play in a campaign that uses this system. For example, if a neck slot item would normally have a base market price of 2,000 gp, it would now grant an additional +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor, and its price would increase by 2,000 gp. That means a neck slot item can't have a final price between 2,000 gp and 3,999 gp. If you need treasure at a value in that range, look at items that don't grant innate bonuses.

To use this system, institute the following changes.
