Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with a range of personal, your skin toughens, granting you a natural armor bonus equal to the spell's level for 1d4 rounds. This bonus does not stack with any other natural armor bonuses you might have.

Bloodline Powers: The power of living things infuses every aspect of your magic, as you draw power from nature and its life energies flow through you.

Tanglevine (Sp): At 1st level, as a standard action, you can create a 15-foot-long, animated vine that springs from your hand. This vine lasts for 1 round and can be used to make a single disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuver, using your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier in place of your normal CMB. You can use this power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Photosynthesis (Ex): At 3rd level, you feed upon nature's raw essence. Your need to eat and sleep is reduced as if wearing a ring of sustenance, and you gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws made against poison and sleep effects. At 9th level, these bonuses increase to +4.

Massmorph (Sp): At 9th level, as a full-round action, you can alter the size and health of plant life, as if using plant growth or diminish plants. Alternatively, you can transform one willing non-plant creature per sorcerer level (no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart) as tree shape. You may transform creatures as plant shape I at 15th level, or plant shape II at 20th level. You can transform non-plant creatures using this power once per day.

Rooting (Ex): At 15th level, as a move action, you can extend roots into the ground. Your speed is reduced to 5 feet, but you gain a +4 bonus to natural armor and a +10 bonus to CMD against bull rush, overrun, reposition, and trip maneuvers. You also gain tremorsense 30 feet and fast healing 1. You can use this power for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

Shepherd of the Trees (Su): At 20th level, your verdant heritage fully manifests. You gain a +4 natural armor bonus. You gain immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning, and you gain tremorsense 30 feet even when not rooted.
