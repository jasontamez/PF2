Description

Technically not a unique kind of weapon, a stitched sling is a sling, staff sling, or double sling whose cup is sewn closed around the ammunition, creating a weak sort of light flail. The ammunition sewn into the sling is irrelevant to the type and amount of damage it causes. A stitched sling cannot be used to fire ammunition unless the thread or cord holding the cup closed is cut open (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity).
