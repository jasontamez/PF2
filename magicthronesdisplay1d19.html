Description

This heavy throne is made of elaborate wrought iron and decorated with shields bearing the ruler's heraldry. A ruler seated upon a throne of ardent defense gains the throne's continuous heroism effect. Acknowledging a ruler sitting upon the throne grants the ability to cast shield other as a spell-like ability once in the next 24 hours. The spell ends if the subject of the spell moves more than 50 feet from either the caster or the throne.
