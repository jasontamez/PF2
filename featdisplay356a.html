You can do more with your blade than slash and stab.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, base attack bonus +2.

Benefit: Choose one of the following combat maneuvers: disarm, reposition, steal, sunder, or trip. You gain a +2 bonus when performing the selected maneuver while wielding an Aldori dueling sword. This bonus does not stack with the bonus provided by a combat maneuver feat with "improved" in its name (such as Improved Trip).

Special: You can select this feat multiple times, choosing a different combat maneuver each time.
