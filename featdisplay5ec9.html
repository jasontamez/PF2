Through dedicated study and training, you can resist the control of possessing spirits.

Benefit: You gain a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to identify creatures with the incorporeal subtype, and can attempt Knowledge checks dealing with incorporeal creatures untrained. When affected by a dominate person, magic jar, or possession spell or a similar ability, your mind and soul remain aware within your body, at war with the invading consciousness. While dominated or possessed, you can attempt a Will save as a swift action to temporarily regain control over your body. On a successful save, you can act normally for 1 round. On a failed save, you cannot attempt to regain control for 1 hour, but the possessing consciousness can't take a swift action that round.
