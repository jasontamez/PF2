A manager is a competent employee qualified to run a business while you're gone, even for weeks or months at a time. A manager is authorized to make certain decisions about your property while you're away, such as paying tax collectors, banning cultists from your store, and handling emergency situations.

Having a manager delays capital attrition <a href="rules15bd.html?Name=Upkeep%20Phase&amp;Category=Downtime%20Phases">Upkeep phase step 3</a>) from 1 every 7 days to 1 every 14 days. As long as the manager's pay is up to date, having a manager look after your business prevents business attrition <a href="rules15bd.html?Name=Upkeep%20Phase&amp;Category=Downtime%20Phases">see step 4 of the Upkeep phase</a>).

Unlike a team, a manager requires daily wages paid in gp. It's customary to pay a manager in advance when you're going to be absent, or arrange to pay wages through a bank or accountant. If you trust the manager, you can even allow her to take wages out of your business's earnings or from money you've set aside for your building or organization.

It's a good idea to give a manager some means of contacting you while you're away, even just an address in a city near where you're adventuring. You might want to provide a magical means of contacting you (and leave funds set aside to pay for it) in case something requires your urgent attention.

A manager stat block is organized as follows.

Wage: This gp value is the manager's daily wage. This wage is for handling normal day-to-day operation of your business, and doesn't include costs for exceptional services. For example, just because you pay your abbot a daily wage doesn't mean you can bring him on adventures to cast spells (in fact, most of his spells are probably used in the course of doing his job managing your Temple).

Skills: This indicates the main skills the manager has ranks in, allowing you or the GM to make skill checks for the manager if an event or encounter requires it. The manager might also have ranks in other skills that aren't relevant to employment duties. The managers here are examples; a specific manager you hire could have different class skills more closely suited to your business. A manager is typically a 3rd-level character with 3 ranks in the appropriate skills and the <a href="rules8e2f.html?Name=Step%202:%20Determine%20Ability%20Scores&amp;Category=Creating%20NPCs">basic NPC ability score array</a>, giving the manager a +7 or +8 for class skills and a +4 or +5 for non-class skills. Many manager roles are similar to specific teams. For example, an Abbot is a Priest who is qualified to run a Temple or religious organization. The primary difference between an Abbot and Priest is that you pay the Abbot a wage to look after your building or organization while you're away, whereas the Priest might be just one of several people with similar duties in your organization. With the GM's approval, you may convert a team to an appropriate manager by paying the NPC (or NPCs) a wage, or vice versa.

You can select a cohort or notable follower to be a manager, but you still must pay a wage. Having a cohort or follower as a manager means you know the manager is loyal to you-it doesn't mean that she'll work for free while you're off adventuring.
