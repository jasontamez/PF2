Description

Rabbits are often raised or hunted for their meat and skins, though some people keep the skittish mammals as pets. Though they are often confused with hares, rabbits are distinctly different in that they make their homes in burrows beneath the ground, and they are usually smaller than hares. Rabbits have the same statistics as rats (see the Bestiary).
