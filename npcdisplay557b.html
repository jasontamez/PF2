The blackscale sorcerer channels the powers of corruption and sloth.

Brax Swampblack

Brax was born in an inbred human village tainted by swamp magic and a forgotten legacy of despicable acts. He is primarily driven by hunger and the urge to corrupt others, though his sloth often gets the better of him. He is equally comfortable sleeping in a bed, in a sewer, or on a pile of corpses. When his laziness overcomes his violent tendencies, he is talkative but dull, concerned more with his inflated ego than anything of consequence.

Combat Encounters: Brax is usually a loner, but he may browbeat simple creatures, such as boggards, orcs, or trolls, into serving him.

Roleplaying Encounters:When Brax is feeling particularly sated, flattery could convince him to work with the PCs, especially if their goal is removing threats to his territory.
