Teisatsu are specialized vigilantes who focus on infiltrating social scenes and high-society gatherings on behalf of the feuding lords of Minkai. Trained as assassins and spies, they cultivate a suite of personalities and study secret arts that hone their bodies into deadly weapons.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Teisatsu are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, short sword, shortbow, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light and medium armor, but not with shields.

This replaces the vigilante's normal weapon and armor proficiencies.

Infiltrator (Ex): A teisatsu is required to choose stalker as his specialization.

This alters vigilante specialization.


Ki Pool (Su): At 2nd level, a teisatsu gains a ki pool, identical to the ninja class feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 14), using his vigilante level as his effective ninja level.

This ability replaces the vigilante talent gained at 2nd level.


Teisatsu Talents: A teisatsu selects vigilante talents as normal. He can't select the rogue talent vigilante talent. He can, however, select either of the talents below, which are unique to the teisatsu.

This ability alters vigilante talents.

Ki Power (Su): The teisatsu gains a single ki power of his choice from the list available to the unchained monk class (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 14).

Shadow Tricks (Ex): The teisatsu gains a single ninja trick (but not a master trick) of his choice. He cannot select a rogue talent in place of a ninja trick in this manner. If he selects a ninja trick marked with an asterisk (*), that talent applies to his hidden strikes instead of to sneak attacks, and the talent counts as a stalker vigilante talent with an asterisk (*) for the limitation of applying only one effect to a single hidden strike.
