Description

The Clavis Somnus is a large, ornate, silver and mithral key. It is very cold to the touch and always gives off a faint vapor of condensation. Its construction and value satisfy the focus component of the breach the veil of dreams occult ritual (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 209) and grants a +5 competence bonus on the primary caster's skill checks to perform the ceremony.

The key also grants its wielder a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist illusion effects, as well as on Charisma checks made in the Dimension of Dreams. But the key imposes a -2 penalty on saving throws against sleep effects, and its holder is considered to have 2 fewer Hit Dice for the purpose of determining the number of Hit Dice used in sleep effects and the number of creatures affected. The key's holder is always counted first when determining which creatures are affected.
