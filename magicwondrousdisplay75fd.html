Description

This leather collar is studded with red and black heliotropes and fastened with an iron clasp. It functions only when worn by a spellcaster's familiar or spirit animal. If a familiar wearing a bloodstone collar is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, the familiar immediately stabilizes at -1 hit points, and any remaining damage is dealt to the familiar's master. The master can refuse this damage, but the feedback of doing so immediately slays the familiar. Each time a bloodstone collar activates, one of its heliotrope studs cracks; once a third stud cracks, the collar becomes a ordinary nonmagical collar. A bloodstone collar is not triggered by death effects or other damaging effects that do not deal hit point damage.
