You possess draconic defenses and a draconic breath weapon.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay37a7.html?ItemName=Draconic%20Aspect">Draconic Aspect</a>, kobold.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus against sleep and paralysis effects. You gain a breath weapon that is determined by your scale coloration by either the Draconic Aspect feat or the dragon-scaled racial trait. Using a breath weapon is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use your breath weapon once per day. Creatures within the area of your breath weapon who succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + your character level + your Constitution modifier) take only half damage.

Black (Su): You breathe a 30-foot line of acid that deals 2d6 points of acid damage.
Blue (Su): You breathe a 30-foot line of electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage.
Green (Su): You breathe a 15-foot cone of acid that deals 2d6 points of acid damage.
Red (Su): You breathe a 15-foot cone of fire that deals 2d6 points of fire damage.
White (Su): You breathe a 15-foot cone of cold that deals 2d6 points of cold damage.

Special: Kobold sorcerers with either the Draconic or Kobold bloodline can use their Charisma modifier instead of their Constitution to determine the DC of this breath weapon.
