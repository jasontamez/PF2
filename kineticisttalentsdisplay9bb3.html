Element air; Type utility (Sp); Level 6; Burn 0
Prerequisite engulfing winds
You can call forth mighty winds in an enormous area. As a standard action, you can alter the wind around you as if using control winds, but the change remains only for as long as you continue to take a standard action to concentrate on this effect. If you accept 1 point of burn, you can extend the duration to 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess without your needing to concentrate.
