You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. After you use Second Chance, you can spend 5 stamina points to still make an attack at your second-highest attack bonus after rerolling your first attack.
