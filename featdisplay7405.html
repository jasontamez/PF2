You are able to implant tricks in yourself in the blink of an eye.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist tricks class feature.

Benefit: Whenever the triggering condition for one mesmerist trick that you have not implanted in yourself occurs, you can implant that trick in yourself as an immediate action. You can then immediately trigger the mesmerist trick as if it were implanted in you when the triggering condition occurred. You can't use this ability if you have already implanted the maximum number of mesmerist tricks in yourself.
