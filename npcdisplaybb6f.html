Esheyna

Esheyna has always had a knack for spotting the weak points in structures, a talent she has long put to use to sabotage enemy siege engines. Now a legendary mercenary, she enjoys bashing apart teams of iron golems just to see how they're supposed to fit together.

Combat Encounters: Esheyna might battle the PCs for control of an ancient juggernaut just so she has bragging rights about destroying it.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Esheyna offers advice and assistance to the PCs about ancient war machines or clockwork invaders from another plane.
