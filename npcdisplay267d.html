Divine loremasters support allies with divinations and healing rather than slinging combat spells or taking up arms in melee.

Onora Goldenfields

Onora never wanted to be an adventurer. Loving knowledge for its own sake, she joined the clergy of the god of wealth so she-d have good connections and resources to help her collect rare books and increase the stores of knowledge she's already begun to accumulate. But as her studies progressed, she became weary of the inaccuracies and blatant lies she found in secondary sources, and decided she needed to seek out knowledge in a more direct way. Now she travels with any adventuring group that will journey to a place where she can gain knowledge of the world or history firsthand. She swears that her own historical and philosophical treatises and volumes will be far more accurate than the ones written by her predecessors.

Combat Encounters: Nearly always supporting a group of adventurers, Onora cares more about accumulating knowledge than the goals of the group she's joined. Though she usually provides support via spells, she's been known to slip away and pilfer books from an enemy spellcaster's library while her allies fight the menace.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Honest to a fault, Onora is never stingy with her knowledge. She believes everyone should have access to the truth-and that truth should be unvarnished and free of all the inaccuracies, alterations made by political powers, and rampant hyperbole that plague so many publications claiming to be factual.
