Ears are the organs used to hear. Creatures without visible ears generally aren't susceptible to called shots to that location. Called shots to the ear are challenging (-10 penalty).

Called Shot: A called shot to the ear deafens that ear for 1 round, and imposes a -2 penalty on Perception checks. A creature that loses hearing in all ears is deafened until hearing is returned by way of the remove blindness/deafness spell or a similar effect.

Critical Called Shot: A critical hit to the ear deafens that ear for 2d6 minutes and leaves the target staggered for 1 round. The target also suffers the effects of a called shot to the ear for that duration.

Debilitating Blow: A debilitating blow to the ear destroys that ear and stuns the target for 1 round, then leaves it staggered for 1d4 rounds, and deafened until removed with the <a href="spelldisplayb16b.html?ItemName=remove%20blindness/deafness">remove blindness/deafness</a> spell or a similar effect. A successful Fortitude saving throw deafens the creature until it is restored by the <a href="spelldisplayb16b.html?ItemName=remove%20blindness/deafness">remove blindness/deafness</a> spell or a similar effect.
