Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplayc15b.html?ItemName=Nimble%20Moves">Nimble Moves</a>, woodland stride class feature.

Benefit:  You can move at full speed even through thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion, even if those areas confer the entangled condition.
