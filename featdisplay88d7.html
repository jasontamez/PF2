Distance can't sever the bond between you and your familiar.

Prerequisites: Intelligence 13, must have a familiar.

Benefit:  You retain your empathic link to your familiar regardless of distance, though lead blocks the link at distances greater than 1 mile (similar to the way lead blocks detect magic effects).
