A character wakes up in a claustrophobic space, walls barely a hand's breadth above his face and to either side. The air is already growing sour, and his increasing heart rate and frantic breathing aren't helping the situation. There's only one thing to do: he has to escape.

By the Rules: In a coffin, a character's ability to move is restricted by the tight confines. Even if he's able to move, the coffin itself and the earth beyond present nearly insurmountable barriers to escape. Relevant to these challenges are the <a href="skillsd16a.html?ItemName=Escape%20Artist">Escape Artist skill</a>, <a href="rulesfb33.html?Name=Smashing%20an%20Object&amp;Category=Breaking%20and%20Entering">rules on hardness</a>, and details on <a href="rules0de5.html?Name=Cave-Ins%20and%20Collapses%20(CR%208)&amp;Category=Dungeon%20Terrain">cave-ins and collapses</a>, as well as the <a href="monsterdisplaydc47.html?ItemName=Gravebound">bury alive ability of the gravebound</a>, which uses the aforementioned systems to determine the ability's effects, including the amount of time it takes to dig up a buried character, with or without a shovel.

Extrapolation: The Escape Artist skill allows a character to move through a tight space by spending 1 minute and succeeding at a DC 30 Escape Artist check. This seems similar to the difficulty of moving within a coffin. As such, the GM might rule that for any action requiring motion to be successful'such as producing an item, making an attack, casting a spell, and so on-the character must spend 1 minute and succeed at this check.

As for the coffin itself, a normal casket is probably of similar quality to a good wooden door or treasure chest, which would mean it has a hardness of 5 and 15 hit points. As soon as the coffin is broken, though, things get much worse for the character who was buried alive. According to the rules on cave-ins and collapses, characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. If such a character falls unconscious, he must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution check each minute. If he fails this check, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute until freed or dead. Thus, a GM might rule that a character can attempt a DC 20 Strength check every minute. If the character succeeds, he manages to clear enough dirt to drag himself upward 1 foot. At that rate, then, it would require six successful Strength checks for a character to dig himself free from a coffin buried 6 feet underground. This, of course, assumes that loose dirt covers the coffin. Other substances, like rocks or metal slabs, would make such a dig far more difficult, at the least, if not outright impossible.

Horror Considerations: The experience of being buried alive can be all the worse if a character isn't alone. Tiny or smaller creatures would not have their movement restricted in a coffin constructed for a Medium creature. <a href="monsterdisplayf6e2.html?ItemName=Crawling%20Hand">Crawling hands</a>, <a href="rulesbe60.html?Name=Rot%20Grubs%20(CR%204)&amp;Category=Sample%20Hazards">rot grubs</a>, <a href="monsterdisplaycb06.html?ItemName=Scarlet%20Spider">scarlet spiders</a>, and <a href="monsterdisplay84bd.html?ItemName=Viper">vipers</a> all make particularly horrible coffinmates, particularly if they're crawling all over the character in swarms. Additionally, breaking out of a coffin and finding himself underwater, buried in a walled-off enclosure, or at the bottom of a tank of flesh-eating beetles might make a character quickly regret his escape.
