Dungeon Guides

Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8wfn?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Dungeoneers-Handbook">Dungeoneer's Handbook</a>
Each dungeon guide can grant bonuses on up to three very specific skill checks both in and out of the dungeon. A PC who has ranks in the guide's associated skill can attempt a check with that skill while using the guide, which takes 1 minute. If she succeeds, she gains a circumstance bonus on one of the guide's listed skill checks (the amount of the bonus is listed with each skill), which the PC must make within 10 minutes. Failure indicates that the guide doesn't include helpful details pertaining to that specific check or that the PC was unable to understand the guide well enough to gain a bonus from it at that time. A PC cannot try again to improve a skill check, though she can attempt to gain the skill bonus on a different check. For example, a PC who fails to gain a bonus from her dungeon guide on dismantling a wooden trap may try to improve a later check with a different wooden trap. A PC cannot gain more than one bonus from a dungeon guide at a time.

Notable Dungeon Guides

The following examples are but a few of the dungeon guides the PCs might encounter while adventuring. Each of these guides is keyed to a specific dungeon on Golarion, and can be a great boon to PCs delving into such sites. GMs can create their own dungeon guides by referencing these examples, which use the following format.

Dungeon Guide Title: Either the title of the dungeon guide or the name most commonly associated with the text if it lacks a title.
Price: The cost of a dungeon guide if it is available for purchase. A character may resell a dungeon guide for half of this amount.
Accuracy: The accuracy bonus of the dungeon guide. This value is added to the guide's accuracy checks.
Associated Skill (DC): A skill keyed to the dungeon guide and the DC of the skill check. If the character consulting the dungeon guide succeeds at an optional check for this skill, there's no chance he'll receive misleading information should the guide fail its accuracy check by 5 or more. A PC must succeed at an associated skill check in order to benefit from a guide's skill bonuses.
Description: A description and brief history of the dungeon guide and which dungeon or dungeons it covers.
Skill Bonuses: The kinds of skill checks bolstered by referencing the guide, the circumstances in which the skill checks must be made, and the bonuses granted on these checks.
