Psychovore Strike - Feats







Psychovore Strike (Combat)

You can land blows that confuse your enemies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaya796.html?ItemName=Psychovore%20Style">Psychovore Style</a>, Sense Motive 9 ranks.

Benefit: When you strike the creature you are gaining a dodge bonus to AC against from Psychovore Style with your unarmed strike, you can force that creature to attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A creature who fails its save is confused for 1d6 rounds. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Wisdom bonus (minimum once per day), and no more than once per round. This is a mind-affecting effect, and a creature confused in this way never attacks you.
