Description

Opponents who swing too hard at targets wearing this armor often regret it'striking jarring armor sends a shock up the arm. Whenever an opponent makes a melee attack against you using the Power Attack feat and misses by 5 or fewer, he must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the bonus that Power Attack would have applied to the attacker's weapon damage roll) or be sickened for 1 round.

Drawback

Jarring armor reduces your speed by 5 feet.
