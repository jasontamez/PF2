Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Wind spirit can select from the following hexes.

Air Barrier (Su): The shaman creates an invisible shell of air that grants her a +4 armor bonus to AC. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2. At 13th level, this barrier causes incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks requiring an attack roll against her to suffer a 50% miss chance. The shaman can use this barrier for 1 hour per shaman level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments.

Sparking Aura (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. Though this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benef it from concealment or invisibility. Furthermore, while the aura lasts, whenever the target is hit with a metal melee weapon, it also takes an amount of electricity damage equal to the shaman's Charisma modifier. The sparking aura lasts a 1 round for ever 2 shaman levels the shaman possesses. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Vortex Spells (Su): Whenever the shaman confirms a critical hit against an opponent with a spell, the target is staggered for 1 round. At 11th level, the duration increases to 1d4 rounds.

Wind Sight (Su): The shaman ignores the penalties on Perception checks caused by wind and the first 100 feet of distance. At 7th level she can, as a standard action, hear or see into any area-as clairaudience or clairvoyance, using that spell's range-provided that there's an unobstructed path for air to travel between the shaman and the target area. This doesn't require line of effect, meaning the path can turn corners and go through spaces as narrow as 1 inch in diameter. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Wind Ward (Su): The shaman can touch a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a ward of wind. This ward lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. When a warded creature is attacked with an arrow, ray, or other ranged attack that requires an attack roll, that attack suffers a 20% miss chance. At 8th level, the ward lasts for 1 minute for every level the shaman possesses. At 16th level, the miss chance increases to 50%. Once affected, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal crackles with electrical energy when it moves, giving off light like a candle. This electricity deals no damage to the animal or any creature that touches the animal. The animal gains electricity resistance 10.

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Wind spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Shocking Touch (Su): As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a shocking weapon.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Wind spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Spark Soul (Su): The shaman gains electricity resistance 10. In addition, as a standard action she can unleash a 20- foot line of sparks from her fingertips, dealing 1d4 points of electricity damage per shaman level she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between each use.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Wind spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Elemental Form (Su): As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) lightning elemental, as if using elemental body IV with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a being of air and electricity. The shaman gains electricity resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any air or electricity spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. She doesn't need to possess these feats to use this ability.
