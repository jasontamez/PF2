Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This small mithral anvil is sized for fine jewelry work and small enough for adventurers to carry. A command word causes it to grow large enough for crafting weapons and armor; a second command word causes it to shrink again. When enlarged, the anvil is a typical heavy anvil of mithral, weighing 200 pounds. When a dwarf crafts a magic item on the anvil while adventuring, she gains full progress for the hours she spends, rather than half.
