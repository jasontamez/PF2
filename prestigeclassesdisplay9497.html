Daivrat

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/store/downloads/pathfinder/pathfinderCompanion/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88zq">Qadira, Gateway to the East pg. 20</a>
The empire of Kelesh is built by genies, who create towering spires and opulent palaces for the padishah emperor in the hopes that a future ruler will set their kinsfolk free. But not all Qadiran mages see genies as creatures to be bested and enslaved. Instead of potential slaves, these daivrat ("brothers of genies") treat genies as powerful allies, wise counselors, and comrades-in-arms. Though few are foolish enough to consider liberating the thralls of the emperor, each daivrat considers herself a soldier, servant, or cousin to the genies.

Many are the names of the genies, and so similar that most cannot discern them. Yet the daivrat knows a djinni from a janni and the difference between a half-janni and a suli-janni. The daivrat is distinctly Qadiran, for no other land in Avistan or Garund has such a tradition of treating with the genie races. Good and neutral-aligned genies welcome a daivrat as a friend, and even hateful efreet know they can rely on their daivrat "friends," sometimes to the daivrat's detriment.

Role: Daivrat fill the same role as standard spellcasters, plus they are effective as diplomats among the genie races and those allied with genie-kind.

Alignment: Daivrat are respected by genies for their willingness to treat them as equals rather than potential slaves. They are never evil.

All of the following are Class Features of the daivrat prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A daivrat gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.

Spells: At the indicated levels, a daivrat gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a daivrat, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Elemental Focus (Su): At 1st level, the daivrat gains a measure of connection with elemental powers. Choose one of the following descriptors: acid, air, cold, earth, electricity, fire, or water. When casting spells of the chosen descriptor, the daivrat is considered to possess the Spell Focus feat for that spell. Only one Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus applies to the casting of a spell.

Genie-Tongue: A daivrat is well-versed in communicating with genies and genie-kin. A daivrat gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence the attitudes of genies and allies of genies, and a +4 bonus to Knowledge checks regarding genies.

Spell-Fetch (Su): Once per day, while preparing spells (or spell slots, for spontaneous casters), a daivrat can conjure a minor genie to find an unusual spell for him. The daivrat chooses one spell he does not know, such as a spell from a prohibited school or from another class's spell list, and sends the genie to fetch magical energy matching that spell. The genie returns after 10 minutes and presents the daivrat with the matching spell energy.

If the daivrat casts spells like a wizard, for the next 24 hours he can prepare the fetched spell as if it were in his spellbook. If he casts spells like a sorcerer, for the next 24 hours he may cast the fetched spell as if he knew it.

At 2nd level, the genie can retrieve any spell of 3rd level or lower. At 5th level, the genie can retrieve any spell of 6th level or lower. At 8th level, the genie can retrieve any spell of 8th level or lower. The genie is incorporeal and has no other powers or abilities (it cannot be used to scout, send messages, and so on) and vanishes once it delivers the spell.

Preparing or casting the fetched spell is more difficult than using spells the daivrat actually knows. If the fetched spell is on the daivrat's spellcasting class's spell list, it is treated as 1 spell level higher than normal; otherwise it is treated as 2 spell levels higher than normal.

Genie's Friend (Su): At 3rd level, a daivrat gains a +2 bonus to his caster level when conjuring genies. At 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.

Elemental Attunement (Ex): At 4th level, the daivrat gains energy resistance 5 against acid, cold, electricity, or fire.

Zhyen Familiar: At 6th level, a daivrat can select a zhyen (see the Bestiary chapter) to serve as his familiar, replacing any familiar he already possesses, as if he had the Improved Familiar feat.

Greater Elemental Focus (Su): At 7th level, the daivrat's connection with his chosen element deepens. When casting spells with the descriptor chosen for his elemental focus ability, the daivrat is now considered to possess the Greater Spell Focus feat. Only one Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus applies to the casting of a spell.

Genie-kin (Ex): At 10th level, the daivrat's type changes to outsider (native). He gains acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 5, resistance 10 against his chosen energy type from his elemental attunement ability, and damage reduction 5/-.
