Description

A knobkerrie, or iwisa, is carved from a single piece of hardwood with a shaft 2 to 4 feet long surmounted by a bulbous knob. The knobkerrie is a traditional hunting weapon among the Zenj people of the Mwangi, but it's also used as a symbol of authority. Many tribal elders use decorated knobkerries as scepters or canes. A knobkerrie is thrown end-over-end. If you are proficient, you gain a +1 bonus on ranged attack rolls with a knobkerrie against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields. If you aren't proficient with a knobkerrie, treat it as a club.
