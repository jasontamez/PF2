Description

Extracted from bioluminescent jellyfish, plankton, and other marine organisms that glow in the ocean's depths, this ink is refined in a process that makes the ink stable and long lasting. This colorful ink glows gently like a candle, so it is easier to discern any writing at a distance, especially in the dark. The ink's glow lasts for about 1 year, after which time the writing remains colorful but no longer glows. Bioluminescent ink is typically stored in a waterproof bladder.
