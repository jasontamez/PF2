Description

This set of mithral masterwork thieves' tools springs to life
in the hands of a skilled user. If the user attempts to use
the tools to disarm a trap or other device, he may spend
a standard action beginning the disarm attempt, after
which the tools continue on their own without being held.
Thereafter, the bearer may perform other actions or even
move away while the tools work. The tools make a Disable
Device using the bearer's skill bonus plus the +2 for being
masterwork thieves' tools, taking the normal amount of time
to disable the device. When the skill check is completed, the
tools remain in place until removed from the device. The tools
can animate for up to 10 rounds per day. They can take 10 but
cannot take 20. If there aren't enough rounds left in the tools to finish a particular check, the bearer can continue where
the animated tools left off as long as she is in the square with
the tools when the animation duration runs out.
