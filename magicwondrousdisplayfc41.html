Description

This item appears to be nothing more than a
string of prayer beads until the owner casts a
divine spell while the beads are carried. Once
that occurs, the owner instantly knows the
powers of the prayer beads and understands
how to activate the strand’s special magical
beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with
a different magic power selected from the following list.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Special Bead Type</td><td>Special Bead Ability</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bead of blessing (CL 1st)</td><td>Wearer can cast bless.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bead of healing (CL 5th)</td><td>Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/deafness, or remove disease.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bead of karma (CL 9th)</td><td>Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bead of smiting (CL 7th)</td><td>Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order’s wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bead of summons (CL 17th)</td><td>Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons
to summon a deity’s emissary
frivolously, the deity takes that
character’s items and places a
geas upon him as punishment at
the very least.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bead of wind walking (CL 11th)</td><td>Wearer can cast wind walk.</td></tr></table>
A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and
a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of
healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater
strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of
karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking.

Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the
bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes
nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind
walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma
and summons can be activated by any character capable of
casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the
strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he
carries it somewhere on his person.

The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the
strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is
missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead
of blessing –600 gp, bead of healing –9,000 gp, bead of karma
–20,000 gp, bead of smiting –16,800 gp, bead of summons
–20,000 gp, bead of wind walking –46,800 gp.
