Description

This drab brown, hooded cloak acts as a cloak of resistance +1 but also quickly absorbs any liquids poured onto it, drying in moments. Three times per day, the wearer can pour a vial of holy water onto the interior lining of an aspergillum cloak, causing its outer surface to glisten and drip. The holy water cannot be recovered once absorbed. For 7 minutes, the garment is soaked in holy water, dealing 2d4 points of damage to any undead or evil outsider that strikes the wearer with an unarmed strike or a natural weapon. An aspergillum cloak can also absorb unholy water instead, dealing damage to good outsiders instead. An aspergillum cloak gains no special abilities from absorbing any other liquid.
