Description

The weapon's blade inflicts wounds that bleed profusely. Only piercing or slashing melee weapons can have a serrated edge. This modification can be added to a sawtooth sabre or rhoka sword without increasing its weapon category, but doing so increases the cost of modification by 2,000 gp. When you make an attack with a weapon with a serrated edge, you can take a -2 penalty on the attack roll. If you do and the attack deals damage, the weapon also inflicts 1 point of bleed damage. This bleed stacks with itself (to a maximum equal to the weapon's critical multiplier), but does not stack with bleed from other sources.
