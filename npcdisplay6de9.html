A death priest serves the goddess of plague and undeath, and seeks to infect, kill, and animate anyone who stands in her way. She might desire to one day become undead, but remains alive for now so she can carry out tasks in places that would never allow the undead.

Relyk Zahim

Relyk obsesses over death and undead, and is in love with her goddess. She longs to become her favored servant and lover, and bestows her strange affections on corpses and undead that remind her of the dark goddess. Relyk always has a bit of a cold or some other minor sickness, though these never debilitate her or affect her abilities in any way; her symptoms might merely be affectations to ward off the unwary or show her devotion. She helps those who want to become undead do so, and is willing to assist other members of her church. However, she watches for anyone who might pass her in prominence within the church. Rivals for her god's affection or attention find that Relyk quickly becomes a devious, heartless enemy.

Combat Encounters: Relyk can be used as a solo opponent, but is much more dangerous with undead allies. Because she is healed by negative energy, she can sustain herself and multiple undead with her channel energy ability, and may pretend to be undead to gain an advantage over gullible enemies.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Relyk can be an advocate for a country ruled by undead, the commander of a large tribe of underground ghouls, or a daytime liaison for a cabal of vampires. When she defeats an enemy, she "graciously" offers to raise him as undead.
