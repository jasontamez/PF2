Description

This disk of paper or light cloth is stretched over a frame of thin wooden supports, with tubes of paper or cured hide spaced evenly around the rim. The whole firework is mounted on a spike or peg and placed on the ground. At the end of the round when it's lit, it spins rapidly and sheds a curtain of dazzling sparks 15 feet wide. The curtain of sparks obscures vision, granting concealment against creatures on the opposite side. A sparking pinwheel burns for 1d4+1 rounds, and any creature that begins its turn adjacent to the curtain of sparks takes 1 point of fire damage and is dazzled for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates). Creatures that pass through the curtain of sparks take 1d4 points of fire damage and are blinded for 1 round (a successful save halves the damage and negates the blindness). If not mounted on a solid, immobile object, a sparking pinwheel cannot spin smoothly and instead fills a single 5-foot square with a shower of sparks; its effects are otherwise unchanged for creatures adjacent to or passing through that square.
