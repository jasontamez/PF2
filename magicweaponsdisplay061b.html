Description

A patriotic weapon radiates with the collective power and
strength of a particular nation of people. If the wielder is a
member of that nationality, he gains several benefits. First,
the wielder gains a +4 insight bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and
Sleight of Hand checks to conceal the weapon from members
of other nationalities. On a successful hit against a flat-footed
target of a different nationality, the target must succeed at DC
13 Will save or be shaken for 1 minute. Finally, the wielder
receives a +2 bonus to confirm critical hits against members of
other nationalities.

The nationality affected must be determined at the patriotic
weapon's creation and cannot be altered. At the GM's discretion,
the nationality named may be a specified human ethnicity, such
as Chelaxian or Shoanti.
