Battle Spirit

A shaman who selects the battle spirit gains scars from every wound she takes, and the grit of battle always seems to cling on her body. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, she grows in stature-becoming taller and more muscular, with a grimace of rage stretching across her face.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Battle spirit can select from the following hexes.

Battle Master (Ex): The shaman makes an extra attack of opportunity each round. This ability stacks with the attacks of opportunity granted by the Combat Reflexes feat. At 8th level, the shaman gains the Weapon Specialization feat in a weapon of her choice as a bonus feat. At 16th level, the shaman gains the Greater Weapon Focus feat as a bonus feat, for the same weapon chosen for Weapon Specialization. The shaman doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these feats.

Battle Ward (Su): The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a battle ward. The next time a foe makes an attack roll against the target, the ward activates and grants a +3 def lection bonus to the warded creature's AC. Each subsequent time she's attacked, the defection bonus reduces by 1 (to +2 for the second time she's attacked and +1 for the third). The ward fades when the bonus is reduced to +0 or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. At 8th level, the ward's starting bonus increases to +4. At 16th level, it increases to +5. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Curse of Suffering (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to take more damage from bleed effects and causes its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Eyes of Battle (Su): The shaman's senses become magically heightened in the heat of battle. As a swift action, she can grant herself a +10 insight bonus for 1 round on Perception checks made to notice and pinpoint invisible creatures within 30 feet. She can instead use this ability as a swift action to ignore the affects of cover or partial cover (but not total cover) on her next attack, as long as that attack is made before the end of her next turn. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her shaman level.

Hampering Hex (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to take a -2 penalty to AC and CMD for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw reduces this to just 1 round. At 8th level, the penalty becomes -4. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature affected by a hampering hex cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal looks like a fiercer version of its species, with rippling muscles and a stockier frame. It gains a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. If it already has a natural armor bonus, the bonus increases by 2 instead.

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Battle spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Battle Spirit (Su): A shaman surrounds herself with the spirit of battle. Allies within 30 feet of the shaman (including the shaman) receive a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level and 16th level, these bonuses increase by 1. The shaman can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Battle spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Enemies' Bane (Su): As a swift action, the shaman imbues a single weapon she's wielding with the bane weapon special ability, choosing the type of creature affected each time she does. The effect lasts for 1 minute. If the weapon already has the bane weapon special ability of the type chosen, the additional damage dealt by bane increases to 4d6. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Battle spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Paragon of Battle (Su): As a standard action, the shaman assumes a form that combines the effects of enlarge person and deadly juggernaut for 1 minute or until dismissed. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of battle. As a full-round action, she can make a full attack and move up to her speed (either before or after the attacks). Whenever she scores a critical hit, the attack ignores damage reduction. She gains a +4 insight bonus to AC for the purposes of confirming critical hits against her. If she is reduced to below 0 hit points, she does not die until her negative hit point total exceeds double her Constitution score.
