Description

When activated, this small masterwork metal gong remains charged with power for 8 hours. When the gong is struck softly, it emits a clear and pleasing tone that instantly focuses the striker's thoughts and mental energy. If the creature striking the gong has a ki pool and worships Irori, she regains 1 ki point. This use expends the power within the gong.
