Description

Rather than narrowing to a single point, a pronged arrow has a wide face with two points resembling a crescent or V-shape. Originally used for hunting game, a pronged arrow deals damage as if one size category smaller, but you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against creatures or objects one or more size categories smaller than you.
