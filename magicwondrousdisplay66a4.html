Description

This amulet grants an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack
and damage rolls with unarmed attacks and natural weapons.

Alternatively, this amulet can grant melee weapon
special abilities, so long as they can be applied to unarmed
attacks. See Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities for a list
of abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for
determining the market value of the item, but do not modify
attack or damage bonuses. An amulet of mighty fists cannot
have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special
ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. An amulet of
mighty fists does not need to have a +1 enhancement bonus
to grant a melee weapon special ability.
