Description

These firecrackers are covered in magical runes and are mixed with ghost salt. One round after you light a spirit firecracker in an adjacent square, the firework detonates and deals 1d4+1 points of damage to incorporeal creatures in the same space. In addition, an affected incorporeal creature with light sensitivity, light blindness, or sunlight powerlessness becomes blinded for 1 round. A spirit firecracker has no effect on corporeal creatures.
