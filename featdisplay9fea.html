Shadows rise and fall at your whim.

Prerequisites: <a href="prestigeclassesdisplay7b69.html?ItemName=Shadowdancer">Shadow illusion class feature.</a>

Benefit: Your shadow illusion ability can encase you in shadows as the <a href="spelldisplay47a2.html?ItemName=darkness">darkness</a> spell, using your shadow dancer level as the caster level. As a standard action, you can raise or lower the illumination level of the effect, from darkness up to normal light.
