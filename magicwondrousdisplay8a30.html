Description

A greater assassin's sight is similar to the standard assassin's sight, but it has a noticeably sleeker design and provides its wielder greater range. It has three settings: 0-30 feet, 30-60 feet, and 60-90 feet. In addition, setting the range on a greater assassin's sight is a standard action (though it still provokes attacks of opportunity). Finally, a greater assassin's sight grants a +4 competence bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits within the set range
