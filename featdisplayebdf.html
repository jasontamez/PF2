Dispelling Critical - Feats







Dispelling Critical (Critical)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 97</a>
Your blows attack the physical and arcane forms of your enemies at the same time.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a>, base attack bonus +11, ability to cast dispel magic.

Benefit:  If you have dispel magic prepared or can cast it spontaneously, when you score a critical hit against an opponent, you may use a swift action to cast dispel magic to make a targeted dispel against that opponent.
