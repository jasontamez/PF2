To determine the price when creating a new scaling item, determine the cost of the base item without any of the level-based upgrades, and increase that price based on each additional ability as described below.

Pricing the Base Item: First, decide whether the new item is a wonder (best for major items), a prize (best for utility items), or a bauble (suitable for items that are interesting but not significant). Price the base item according to the <a href="rules3cd2.html?Name=Magic%20Item%20Gold%20Piece%20Values&amp;Category=Magic%20Item%20Creation">normal rules for creating magic items</a>. Then, using the column on <a href="rulesd734.html?Name=Adjusting%20Treasure&amp;Category=Scaling%20Items">Table 4-13</a> that corresponds to the item's category, find the lowest gp value that includes that initial price. Use that value to determine the item's starting caster level.

Adding Scaling Abilities: Use the following steps to assign additional abilities and spells, and the levels at which those abilities unlock.

Adding Unlockable Abilities: Determine the first unlockable ability or increase in power. Price the item again, using the new ability plus all the abilities of the base item; you will use this price to determine the level at which the ability unlocks (see below). However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a <a href="spelldisplay3e9a.html?ItemName=burning%20hands">burning hands</a> effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements <a href="spelldisplay3e9a.html?ItemName=burning%20hands">burning hands</a> so well.

Adding Spells: Assign a price for any spells the item allows its owner to use. Table 4-14: Spell Prices includes the typical prices of one daily use of spells at different caster levels. Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>. Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level.

Remember to readjust the price at each further power unlock level, since the caster level of the item will match the owner's level. On a worn item, waive the standard 50% price increase on the additional spells.

Assigning an Unlock Level: Now that you have a cost for the next scaling ability, assign a level at which that ability unlocks. This follows the same process as the Pricing the Base Item step, but using the new cost. You should usually round down, but if you're almost at the higher-level price, bump up the level. For example, a prize that priced out at 8,000 gp at a given set of powers would unlock those powers at 9th level (6,900 gp), but if the price hits 9,000 gp, the abilities should instead unlock at 10th level (9,300 gp).

Completing the Item: Repeat this process for each set of new powers. Try to add a new unlockable ability every 2 to 4 levels. It's not necessary to scale every item all the way to 20th level, however'stop when the set of abilities feels complete.
