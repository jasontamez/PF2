Description

This extravagant, ridiculous, and mostly ineffective kit is touted by nobles seeking to venture into the wilderness. It consists of a complex banner (depicting a family crest or symbol of the presiding noble), four bedrolls (for servants), four blankets (for servants), two cots (for nobles), two winter blankets (for nobles), 10 cups of coffee, a royal outfit, two large tents, and a pavilion tent.

Anyone with a modicum of wilderness experience should recognize that the kit's contents are of little use on a prolonged journey. Oftentimes, the actual necessities of wilderness survival are left to the servants to handle.
