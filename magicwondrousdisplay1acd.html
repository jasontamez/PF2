Description

The brass buckle on this stout leather
belt is fashioned to resemble three
demonic faces. Once each round, this
belt's buckle can animate, lashing out
at a creature that provokes an attack of
opportunity within 5 feet. This attack uses its wearer's base
attack bonus and Strength modifier, with a +4 competence
bonus. It deals damage as a bite attack made by a creature
of its wearer's size (1d6 for a Medium wearer; see Table
3-1: Natural Attacks by Size, Bestiary 302) plus the wearer's
Strength modifier. This belt does not add to the normal
number of attacks the wearer can make in a round; it offers
another way in which to make attacks of opportunity.
