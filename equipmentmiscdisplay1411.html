Description

One of the oldest known dwarven ales, longbeard lambic is fermented with wild airborne yeasts and cultures, especially those that proliferate in the dank caves where it has been brewed since long before the Quest for Sky began. Longbeard lambic has a bracing effect that shocks the system. If the drinker is fatigued, shaken, or staggered, she can ignore these conditions for 1d4 rounds after imbibing longbeard lambic. In addition, a dose of longbeard lambic can reduce the exhausted condition to fatigued or the frightened condition to shaken (drinker's choice) for the same duration. If you consume a second longbeard lambic within 1 minute of the previous dose, you must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The DC increases by 5 for each dose imbibed within the same time span. Dwarves gain a +5 racial bonus on this saving throw.
