Boons

1: Focus of Mind (Su) You gain one gaze ability from the list detailed as part of the assiduous gaze class feature of the Hellknight signifer prestige class (Pathfinder Campaign Setting Paths of Prestige 29). You can choose only a gaze that a Hellknight signifer could choose at 4th level. If you already have the assiduous gaze ability, you can select one additional gaze. Additionally, if you do not already have one, you receive the mask described in the prestige class's signifer mask class feature (and also detailed on page 63), as well as the benefits of the Hellknight signifer prestige class's signifer mask supernatural ability; you must be wearing a signifer mask to use this ability.
2: Armored Spellcasting (Ex) You have mastered the delicate and yet taxing art of casting spells in your Hellknight armor. You can ignore the spell failure chance of any armor with "Hellknight" in the name.
3: Unfathomable Gaze (Sp) You are able to focus your staunch Hellknight training into a spell-like ritual that allows you to glean information that could be vital to your mission of enforcing the law. Once per day, while wearing a signifer mask, you can use vision as a spell-like ability, treating your total character level as your caster level. Unlike casting the spell normally, you are not fatigued after this ability is complete, as your training allows you to shake off what might tire lesser individuals.Order of the Gate Hellknights seek to curb and prevent lawlessness through magic and manipulation. They have reputations as mysterious, emotionless, and sometimes cruel magic-users. Many are convinced that the Order of the Gate's Hellknights are spying on them or already know their secrets. Sometimes this fear is true, as the order's members prefer preventing crime to punishing it and often use manipulation, information-gathering, and spying to further their agenda.
