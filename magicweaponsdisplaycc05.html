Description

This +1 cestus of blackened leather is reinforced with strips of dark iron over the fingers and cruel spikes along the back of the hand and forearm. With a mental command, the wearer can cause a series of cords, chains, and braces around the palm to lock a held weapon in place, gaining a +10 bonus to her CMD to prevent that weapon from being disarmed. While the cestus is locked in this manner, the wearer can't use the hand wearing it to complete the somatic component of spells or for skill checks. Locking or unlocking a weapon is a move action.

If the wearer drops the weapon or is disarmed, regardless of whether the cestus was locked, a leather strap attached to the weapon prevents it from moving farther than the wielder's square, and the wielder can recover the weapon as a move action. As a move action, the wearer can issue a mental command that causes the strap to detach from the weapon. As with a weapon cord (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 75), the wearer cannot otherwise switch to a different weapon in that hand unless the strap is detached or cut (a move action or an attack, hardness 1, 5 hp). If the strap is damaged or destroyed, the cestus's wearer can spend 1 minute wrapping a mundane weapon cord around the cestus, in which case the cestus absorbs the weapon cord into itself and the leather strap mends itself completely.
