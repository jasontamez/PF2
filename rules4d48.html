These options are most appropriate for monsters with high Strength or that rely on overwhelming physical attacks.

Awesome Blow: As a standard action, the monster can attempt an awesome blow combat maneuver. If it succeeds, the target takes damage as if it had been hit by one of the monster's attacks, is knocked 10 feet in a direction of the monster's choice, and falls prone. The target must be moved in a straight line; if it hits an obstacle, both it and the obstacle take 1d6 points of damage.

Bleed: The monster's attacks deal 1d6 points of bleed damage. This increases to 1d8 at CR 6, 1d10 at CR 11, 2d6 at CR 16, and 3d6 at CR 21. Bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or with any magical healing.

Burn: This uses the same damage values as the bleed option (see above), but deals fire damage and requires the target to succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire.

Constrict: Whenever this monster succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver, it deals its high weapon damage.

Critical Striker: The monster gains a +4 bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits. This monster also doubles its critical threat range with one of its attacks.

Defense Breaker: When this monster hits an opponent, that opponent is flat-footed for the next attack made against it. If the monster makes a full-round attack, this takes effect after all its attacks and affects all targets hit.

Power Attack: The monster's main attack uses the low attack value, but deals 50% more damage.

Powerful Charge: The monster's charge attacks deal 50% more damage.

Quivering Palm: Once per day, the monster can use this option when it makes an attack against a target that is not immune to critical hits. On a hit, the target is affected by the monster's quivering palm. At any point within a number of days equal to the monster's CR, the monster can force the target to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5). The target dies on a failure, and ends the quivering palm effect on a successful one.

Rage: This monster can fly into a rage as a free action, either at its choice (as the barbarian class feature) or on the turn after it takes damage in combat (as the <a href="umr4783.html?ItemName=Blood%20Rage">blood rage</a> universal monster rule). While raging, the monster gains additional hit points equal to double its CR, and deals 3 extra points of damage on Strength-based attacks. The monster also gains a +2 bonus on Will saves and takes a -2 penalty to AC. The rage lasts until the end of the battle or for 1 minute, whichever comes first.

CR 10: The monster instead gains hp equal to triple its CR, deals 4 extra points of damage on Strength-based attacks, and gains a +3 bonus on Will saves.

CR 19: The monster instead gains hp equal to quadruple its CR, deals 6 extra points of damage on Strength-based attacks, and gains a +4 bonus on Will saves.

Rend: If the monster hits the same target with two or more attacks in 1 round, it rends-dealing its high weapon damage. It can do this once per round.

Slaying Attack: Once per day as a standard action, the monster can make a single attack that can kill a creature outright. On a hit, the attack deals normal damage and the target must succeed at a save or die. The type of save is either Fortitude or Will, chosen when the monster gains this option. This option typically appears only on monsters of CR 19 or higher.

Stun Attack: The monster can make one of its attacks a stun attack once per round. On a hit, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) or become stunned for 1 round. A creature is immune to this ability if it is a construct, ooze, plant, or undead, or if it is incorporeal or immune to critical hits. The monster can use this option a number of times per day equal to its CR.

Trample: The monster can automatically overrun creatures smaller than itself as a full-round action. It automatically deals its high weapon damage to each creature it runs over in this way (dealing damage only once per round to any given creature). A creature being trampled can either attempt an attack of opportunity at a -4 penalty or attempt a Reflex save (DC = 2 ?? the monster's ability DC - 10) to take half damage.
