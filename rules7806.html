Loci spirits can't be damaged conventionally, but are susceptible to corruption if certain actions occur within their areas. Each loci spirit has a number of hit points equal to twice its CR, which it uses to resist corruption. Certain particularly vile acts reduce a loci spirit's hit points and bring it closer to corruption, while certain acts of good can restore hit points and protect the loci spirit from corruption.

If a loci spirit is reduced to 0 hit points, it becomes corrupted; thereafter, it acts as a <a href="rules2924.html?Name=Haunts&amp;Category=Advanced%20Topics">haunt</a> of the same CR and loses any loci spirit permanent effects. Once a loci spirit has been corrupted, its effects instead manifest as mind-affecting fear effects. These new effects should have a similar power level to that of the ceremonial effect the loci spirit previously manifested. A corrupted loci spirit has the aura of an evil outsider for the purposes of <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a> and similar effects. Unlike a haunt, a corrupted loci spirit can't take the tricked by <a href="spelldisplay31d1.html?ItemName=hide%20from%20undead">hide from undead</a> weakness, but it can take most other haunt modifiers as long as its CR remains the same. The haunt has the same number of hit points as the loci spirit originally did; these are separate from its loci spirit hit points, which remain at 0 until the loci spirit is purified.

Corrupted loci spirits can be neutralized or destroyed in the same fashion as haunts. While a corrupted loci spirit is inactive because of being neutralized, characters can use effects that restore a loci spirit's hit points to attempt to purify it (see the table in the previous column). For the purpose of purification, increasing the loci spirit's hit points does not restore the haunt's hit points. If a character manages to restore the full hit points of the uncorrupted loci spirit, the character has purged the corruption entirely, and the loci spirit returns to its former benevolence. This could potentially occur over the course of multiple encounters with the corrupted spirit. Until then, the haunt continues to reset.
