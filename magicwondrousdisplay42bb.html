Description

This exotic, fur-trimmed cloak is decorated with golden filigree. In addition to offering magical protection, the cloak guides a skilled wearer's blade to block attacks. Such cloaks are often commissioned by Aldori Academy graduates when they attain swordlord status.

A swordlord's cloak acts as a cloak of resistance. In addition, whenever the wearer is benefiting from the defensive parry class feature, he receives an insight bonus to his AC equal to the cloak's resistance bonus.
