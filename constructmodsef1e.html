Description

This modification allows a construct to alert its creator with a mental alarm. The creator sets a specific password for the construct. Any creature it encounters that does not speak the password within 1 round causes the construct to activate the mental alarm, which alerts the creator so long as the creator is within 1 mile. The mental alarm awakens the creator from nonmagical sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. The creator can deactivate or reactivate a construct's alarm feature as a standard action. The maximum distance of the mental alarm can be increased by paying an additional 250 gp for each additional mile of maximum distance.
