Description

This roll of flexible green leather can be easily wrapped around the stump of a severed limb (a finger, toe, hand, foot, arm, leg, tail, or even neck-though the last works only in the case of multi-headed creatures). The body part regrows over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquet is not removed. While a creature wears a trollskin tourniquet, it does not need to remain entirely still. However, if it sustain an amount of hit points of damage equal to or greater than 3 ?? its Hit Dice, the tourniquet is jostled out of position and must be reset. This also resets the regrowth time period required; the tourniquet must remain on the stump for 24 hours from the time it was reset to regrow the limb.

While a trollskin tourniquet can't restore a dead creature to life, it can repair a corpse to make it easier to resurrect. This requires at least a partially whole decomposed or skeletonized inanimate corpse, and the tourniquet must be placed around an intact limb, the chest, or some other portion of the corpse. The corpse regenerates over a period of 24 hours as long as the trollskin tourniquetis not removed (if the tourniquet is jostled, the regrowth time resets, as described above with regard to a living creature). At the end of this time, the corpse becomes whole and any missing parts are restored. The deceased creature is treated as having been dead for no more than 1 day for the purposes of resurrection magic. Each trollskin tourniquet is usable once.
