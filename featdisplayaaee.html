Your curled fingers can tear into opponents' flesh and snatch free grappled allies.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, Escape Artist 1 rank.

Benefit: You can choose for your unarmed attacks to deal slashing damage. If you strike a target that has another creature grappled or pinned, as a swift action you can immediately attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against the target's CMD. If you succeed at the check, you can force the target to release a grappled creature or switch a pinned creature to being merely grappled.
