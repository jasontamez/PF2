Description

This red-and-black naval ensign displays the grinning skull and crossed manacles of the Shackles. While the flag feels as sleek as silk, the material is stronger than the toughest sail canvas. Openly flying a Shackles ensign improves the initial attitude of most hostile or unfriendly pirates by one step, and worsens the starting attitude of those opposed to piracy by one step. The ensign has no effect when not properly mounted on a ship.

Once per day, a Shackles ensign can be hoisted and unfurled on a ship to impose a sinister sense of doom upon an opposing ship's crew. It takes two full-round actions to raise the flag. All non-pirate creatures (defined at the GM's discretion) within 300 feet who are able to see the flag take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute. This is a visual mindaffecting effect. In addition, all allied creatures aboard the ship flying the Shackles ensign gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1 minute.
