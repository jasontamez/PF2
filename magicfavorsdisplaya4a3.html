Description

This favor is a pretty button that does not need to be donned, but merely placed in a pouch or pocket and carried by the recipient. A lucky button is activated as soon as it is given by the presenter. When the presenter bestows a lucky button, he names a single skill. For 1 week, the recipient gains a +2 luck bonus on skill rolls of that type.
