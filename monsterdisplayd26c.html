Yethazmari - Monsters







Herald, Yethazmari

Double the size of a man at its shoulder, this creature looks like a gigantic, starving jackal, but from its back beat the tattered black wings of a monstrous bat. A canine head sprouts from where it would be natural for one to rest, but behind, where the creature's tail should begin, instead sways the sleek, strong coils of a viper, ending in a fanged head that arcs over the monster's back. Twin trails of thin smoke, like those from dying embers, rise from where the thing's jackal eyes should be, roiling up from depthless hollows gaping in the horror's snarling visage.

Yethazmari CR 15

Special Abilities

Bay (Su) When a yethazmari howls or barks, all creatures except other evil outsiders within a 300-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 25 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same yethazmari's bay for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Maddening Vision (Su) A yethazmari can unleash a blast of abyssal smoke from its eyes (25-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 12d10 fire, Reflex DC 25 half). Creatures of an alignment other than chaotic that are damaged by this effect must make additional DC 25 Will saves as their minds are assaulted with unspeakable visions. Those who fail this save are affected as per the spell confusion for 1d6 rounds. These save DCs are Constitution-based.

Poison (Su) Contact or injury, Fortitude DC 25, initial damage 2d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Poison Gout (Su) A yethazmari can use its serpentine head to spit a gout of burning, acidic poison at a creature within 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack that deals 6d10 points of acid damage. Any creature damaged by the attack is affected by the yethazmari's poison.

Soul Scream (Su) Any time a yethazmari takes piercing or slashing damage from any source, the wounds created in its flesh unleash a terrifying cacophony. This is terrible noise has the same effects as the creature's bay special attack. Creatures within 10 feet of the yethazmari take a -4 penalty on their save versus this effect.

Description

Said to howl through the lightless sky on the nights of lunar eclipses, hunting for lone travelers to drag back to Lamashtu's realm, the yethazmari is the herald of the Mother of Monsters. A 14-foot-tall poisonous jackal with a snake for a tail and wings as black as pitch, the yethazmari is known to be among Lamashtu's favorite offspring, as well as her lapdog. Having hunted at the Demon Queen's side for untold centuries and witnessed some of her most profane atrocities, the thing's eyes have burnt to smoldering coals, loose in the depths of its skull. Now it sees only worlds undone, endless ruinous visions of reality rent at the claws of the Mother of Monsters.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
