Benefit: Whenever you deal piercing or slashing damage with your primary natural weapons, your opponent takes 1d6 points of bleed damage at the start of his turn each round, in addition to the damage dealt by the attack. Bleed damage can be stopped with a successful DC 15 Heal skill check or any magical healing.
