Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

This ritual conjures forth a restless spirit or otherworldly entity to harass and sabotage a target of the caster's choice. The ritual must take place in an environment pleasing to the nemesis creature (an allip must be called in an asylum, a gremlin must be called in a clocktower or site of misfortune, etc.). The caster supplicates before a representation- usually a statue or tapestry-of the nemesis creature, reciting a long litany of the target's real or imagined sins and how deeply the target deserves to suffer.

Success conjures up the nemesis creature chosen from the list below, which goes forth to harass the victim to the best of its abilities. A pugwampi will hide and subject its victim to bad luck, while a lovelorn will stalk the victim and undermine his relationships.

Nemesis creatures do not kill their victims, and they avoid doing anything that might result in their victims' deaths (though they have no rules against killing others).

Beyond defining the nemesis creature's target, the ritual casters have no special control over or connection to the conjured beast.

A nemesis creature always knows its victim's location, but it must travel to the victim under its own power (or its creator's power). A victim can conceal itself from the nemesis creature's senses for 24 hours by succeeding at a Will saving throw each day at dawn. Should the nemesis creature be discovered and slain, its spirit returns to the depiction used to conjure it, where it re-forms after 1d4 days per Hit Die. Once re-formed, the nemesis creature emerges from its depiction to resume its campaign of subterfuge. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a miracle or wish spell. If the depiction of the nemesis creature is destroyed or if it is targeted with a remove curse or break enchantment spell, the nemesis creature is immediately destroyed and the curse ends.
