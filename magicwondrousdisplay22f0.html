Description

These worn, shapeless leather slippers magically shrink or enlarge to fit any foot placed within, and are as comfortable as a wellbroken- in pair of boots. When worn by a halfling, the slippers fade from view almost entirely, manifesting as strips of soft leather wound around the ankles so as to allow the halfling to enjoy the comforts of being barefoot while still wearing them.

A pair of subtle slippers conceal their wearer's passage, leaving no footprints or scent trail, as per the spell pass without trace, regardless of terrain. They also grant the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Once per day as a standard action, a character wearing subtle slippers can select up to four other creatures within 30 feet to gain a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus lasts for 1 hour, but is suppressed for any creature who moves more than 30 feet away from the character wearing the slippers. If that creature returns to a position within 30 feet of the wearer of the slippers before the effect's duration expires, the bonus reactivates for that character. The effect ends at once for all affected if the wearer of the slippers removes the footwear, is knocked unconscious, or is killed.
