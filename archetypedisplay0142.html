Firearms can be potent tools for striking fear into the hearts of enemies, and canny vigilantes use this to their advantage. Gunmasters brandish firearms like extensions of their will, taking down their foes with deadly accuracy and skill.

Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: A gunmaster is proficient with all firearms but not with martial weapons or medium armor.

This alters the vigilante's weapon and armor proficiencies.

Gunmaster: At 1st level, a gunmaster gains the gunslinger's gunsmith ability (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 9). Additionally, the Gunsmithing bonus feat allows the gunmaster to repair and restore his initial battered firearm as if he were a gunslinger. At 5th level, and every 4 vigilante levels thereafter, the gunmaster gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with all firearms.

This ability replaces vigilante specialization.

Gunmaster Talents: A gunmaster can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.

This alters vigilante talents.

Deadeye (Ex): Once per day, the gunmaster can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing one increment beyond his firearm's first range increment. The gunmaster still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls for shooting a target outside the firearm's first range increment. At 6th level and every 4 vigilante levels thereafter, he can use this ability one additional time per day. A gunmaster can spend multiple daily uses to resolve an attack at a further range increment (for instance, he can spend three uses to resolve an attack three increments beyond his first range increment).

Death's Shot (Ex): Three times per day, as an immediate action when the gunmaster scores a critical hit, he can attempt to kill his enemy instantly. When the gunmaster uses this talent, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunmaster's vigilante level + his Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies instantly. A gunmaster must be 20th level to select this talent.

Gunmaster Initiative (Ex): The gunmaster gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if he has the Quick Draw feat, his hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, he can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check. A gunmaster must be at least 4th level to select this talent.

Lightning Reload (Ex): A number of times per day equal to half his vigilante level, a gunmaster can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a swift action once per round. If he has the Rapid Reload feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), he can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round instead. Using this talent does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A gunmaster must be at least 12th level to select this talent.

Quick Clear (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, the gunmaster can remove the broken condition from a single firearm he is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. Starting at 12th level, once per day, when the gunmaster rolls a misfire with a gun that has the broken condition, she can prevent the gun from exploding, though it retains the broken condition.

Nimble (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a gunmaster gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC while wearing light or no armor. Anything that causes the gunmaster to lose her Dexterity bonus to AC also causes the gunmaster to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 vigilante levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of +3 at 16th level).

This ability replaces unshakable.
