Description

This spell enables you to converse with creatures associated with a chosen element, including but not limited to true elemental creatures. This spell gains the elemental subtype based on the version of the spell you cast. Elemental speech does not guarantee a friendly reaction; it merely enables communication. You may converse with all creatures of the selected type with an Intelligence score of 1 or greater, even if they do not understand one another.

When cast as an air spell, you can converse in Auran and with any creature that has the air subtype or a fly speed.

When cast as an earth spell, you can converse in Terran and with any creature that has the earth subtype or a burrow speed.

When cast as a fire spell, you can converse in Ignan and with any creature that has the fire subtype.

When cast as a water spell, you can converse in Aquan and with any creature that has the water subtype or a swim speed.
