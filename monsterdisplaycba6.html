Creating a Mummified Animal

"Mummified animal" is an acquired template that can be added to a creature of the animal type. A mummified animal uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: HD 4 or fewer, as base creature; HD 5 to 10, as base creature +1; HD 11 or more, as base creature +2.
Alignment: Neutral evil.
Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skills.
Senses: A mummified animal gains darkvision 60 ft.
Defensive Abilities: A mummified animal gains damage reduction based on its Hit Dice: one with 5 or fewer Hit Dice gains DR 2/-, one with 6-10 Hit Dice gains DR 5/-, and one with 11-20 Hit Dice gains DR 10/-.
Speed: Winged mummified animals can still fly, but their maneuverability drops to clumsy. Retain all other movement types.
Special Attacks: A mummified animal retains all special attacks except those dependent on a living body to function, such as a snake's poison or a skunk's revolting musk. A mummified animal also gains the following special attack.
Servant's Curse (Su): Once per day, a mummified animal can touch a creature or hit a creature with one of its natural attacks to deliver a curse. Any living creature struck by this attack must succeed at a Will save or take 1d3 points of Dex and Wis damage. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the mummified animal's Hit Dice + the mummified animal's Charisma modifier.
Abilities: A mummified animal loses its Constitution score, and its Charisma score becomes 14.
