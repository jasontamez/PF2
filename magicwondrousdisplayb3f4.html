Description

This unassuming cloak initially appears to be made of plain
leather. When the wearer speaks the command word,
however, the cloak of the scuttling rat wraps itself around
her, transforming her into a dire rat as if using beast shape
I. The wearer can remain in dire rat form for up to 5 minutes
per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be
used in 1-minute increments.
