Originally trained and employed by the enforcers of the Pure Legion seeking to defend Rahadoum from divine spellcasters, Rahadoumi spiritslayers have proven so invaluable in culling ghosts, shadow demons, and other incorporeal creatures that their techniques have spread across the Inner Sea region and beyond. Ironically, most now are trained and employed by the church of Pharasma to cull wicked spirits.


Spirit Sense (Ex)
: At 2nd level, a spiritslayer manifests an uncanny sixth sense regarding the presence of invisible creatures. He gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat and ignores the usual +20 bonus to the DC of any Perception check to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. If the spiritslayer manages to pinpoint an invisible creature's location using a Perception check, he can study that creature with his studied target ability as a swift action.

In addition, whenever the spiritslayer studies a possessed creature, he can automatically switch his studied target from the possessed creature to the possessing entity should that entity be expelled from his studied target. A spiritslayer adds his studied target bonus on attack rolls to all saving throws he attempts against possession effects used by his studied targets.

This ability replaces the slayer talent gained at 2nd level.


Spiritslayer Talents
: A spiritslayer can select the following slayer talents, in addition to general slayer talents.

Disrupt Possession (Ex): Whenever a spiritslayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage to a creature that is being possessed, he also deals his sneak attack damage to the possessing entity. Once per round, a possessed creature that is damaged by disrupt possession can attempt a new Will saving throw to end the possession, gaining a +1 bonus on its save for each sneak attack damage die the spiritslayer rolled. This talent alters the spiritslayer's sneak attack, and doesn't stack with other talents that alter sneak attack. A spiritslayer must be at least 8th level before selecting this talent.

Greater Spirit Sense: A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Greater Blind-Fight as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level to his Perception checks to pinpoint the location of ethereal creatures, and once per round he can attempt a Perception check to pinpoint the locations of all invisible creatures within 30 feet of him without needing to take an action. A spiritslayer must be at least 10th level and have the improved spirit sense spiritslayer talent before selecting this talent.

Improved Spirit Sense: A spiritslayer who selects this talent gains Improved Blind-Fight as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. In addition, he adds 1/2 his slayer level on Perception checks to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature. He can use Perception to pinpoint the location of an ethereal creature, but he doesn't gain this bonus on Perception checks when doing so. A spiritslayer must be at least 6th level before selecting this talent.


Ghost Slayer (Ex)
: At 7th level, whenever a spiritslayer makes an outsider or undead creature with the incorporeal subtype his studied target, his attacks count as magic for the purpose of striking that creature (though this doesn't give his attacks an enhancement bonus) and he can deal precision-based damage to such creatures (though his precision damage is reduced by 50% unless he has a means to bypass the creature's reduction in damage from corporeal sources, such as a ghost touch weapon). At 14th level, the spiritslayer's attacks against outsiders or undead creatures with the incorporeal subtype ignore the 50% reduction in damage from magical corporeal sources that such creatures have and can deal precision-based damage to incorporeal creatures.

This ability replaces stalker.
