Bigger than others of its kind, a bully is used to winning fights and displays of dominance for its choice of mates, territory, or other privileges.

Bully Feats: In addition to the standard feats available to animal companions, a bully can select Greater Bull Rush, Greater Overrun, Greater Reposition, Greater Trip, Improved Reposition, and Improved Trip. It can use Power Attack instead of Combat Expertise as a prerequisite to qualify for feats on this list.

This replaces share spells.

Bullying Thrill (Ex): At 9th level, whenever a bully succeeds at a bull rush, overrun, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check, after fully resolving the combat maneuver, it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls until the end of its next turn.

This replaces Multiattack.
