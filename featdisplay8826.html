The boulders you hurl burn so hot that they smoke.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +11, heated rock special ability.

Benefit:  When you throw a rock as part of an attack action and hit your target, you can cause the boulder to emit a 10-foot-radius spread of heavy smoke. The smoke lasts for 1d4 rounds. (See page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for rules on smoke effects.)
