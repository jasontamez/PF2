Description

This large wood-and-hide shield is similar to other Mwangi shields, but the totem animal painted on the shield's face seems to move when the shield is carried. Crafted by Mwangi shamans to grant its wielder the power of tribal totem spirits, a Mwangi spirit shield functions as a +1 ghost touch light wooden shield. Once per day on command, the shield can grant its bearer bull's strength for 1 minute.

Other versions of the Mwangi spirit shield exist; some are known to grant cat's grace or bear's endurance to their wielders instead of bull's strength.
