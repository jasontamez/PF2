The GM rolls this type of Finesse check in secret so you don't know whether you're successful. If you succeed, you disable the device. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't disable it, but can try again. If you fail to disable a trap by 5 or more, the trap triggers. If you fail to sabotage a different type of device by 5 or more, you think you succeeded but the device actually functions normally.

You can attempt to leave no trace of your tampering, but this increases the DC by 5. You can rig simple devices (such as saddles and wagon wheels) to function normally and break after some period of time (usually 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Device</td><td>Time</td><td>Finesse DC</td><td>Example</td></tr> <tr><td>Simple</td><td>1 round</td><td>10</td><td>Jam a lock</td></tr> <tr><td>Tricky</td><td>1d4 rounds</td><td>15</td><td>Sabotage a wagon wheel</td></tr> <tr><td>Difficult</td><td>2d4 rounds</td><td>20</td><td>Disarm or reset a trap</td></tr> <tr><td>Extreme</td><td>2d4 rounds</td><td>25</td><td>Disarm a complex trap, cleverly sabotage a clockwork device</td></tr> </table>

Action: Varies (see table). Beginning or continuing the process of disarming is a full-round action.

Try Again: Yes, but only if you fail by 4 or less.
