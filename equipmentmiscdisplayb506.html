Description

Bearing a marked resemblance to an anthropomorphic wind chime, this complicated arrangement of strings, sticks, and bells is hung from a ceiling or branch and has a purse or money-pouch deep inside. The trick is to silently steal a coin from Billy Ten-Bells, as the slightest movement will set the bells ringing. Veteran thieves sometimes decorate Billy with scraps of stolen clothing for good luck. Training with Billy Ten-Bells requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to pick pockets. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Sleight of Hand check.
