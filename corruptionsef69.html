Corruptions









Corruptions

Even the most pure creature can succumb to tides of darkness. What begins as a minor malady or errant idea can grow into something malignant-a spreading corruption that can obscure your morals, cloud your judgment, and ultimately devour your soul. There are a number of different types of corruptions, from the hunger of vampirism to the horrifying transformation of the promethean. Living with a corruption is often a terrifying experience, but also offers the temptation of dark gifts. Hosts sometimes choose not to fight the corruption, but rather accept it and allow it to progress. These unfortunate folk either succumb to lust for the corruption's power or attempt to control the stain of corruption and use its gifts for some greater good.<a href="rules415e.html?Name=Corruption&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Corruptions.</a>

While even the noblest heroes can fall victim to corruption of body, mind, or spirit, antiheroes who tread ethically gray waters are often at higher risk of losing themselves to the moral decay detailed below.

When an otherwise upstanding person turns to evil deeds to achieve his goals-whether by accident, due to sinister influence, or through desperation-he begins to slip, every excuse and justification furthering his descent into evil.


Catalyst

This corruption often begins when you allow an evil force into your life to help you accomplish an otherwise noble goal. In the name of helping a community or saving a loved one, you may have fallen in league with a disguised succubus or made a desperate deal with a dark power.

Characters wh0 are already neutral or evil cannot gain this corruption.


Progression

The progression of this corruption is tied to evil actions taken to achieve a significant benevolent goal (identified when you gain this corruption), especially when such actions provide an easier road to success than good actions. A significant goal might be deposing a tyrant or rescuing a prisoner of war, but it is up to the GM to determine what qualifies. Whenever you commit an evil act in pursuit of your significant goal, you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). You must also attempt this saving throw after any month in which the number of evil acts you performed in pursuit of your goal is less than your manifestation level. If you fail any of these saving throws, you are overcome with the urge to commit a wantonly evil act that does not significantly advance your benevolent goal; this also causes you to progress to the next corruption stage. If others prevent this wantonly evil act, you shake off this urge, but the DC of future saving throws to prevent the corruption's progress increases by 2; this increase stacks each time you shake off the urge, but it resets when you reach the next corruption stage.

Performing a wantonly evil action for your own enjoyment automatically progresses the corruption to the next stage.

Corruption Stage 1: The first time you engage in an evil act to further your goal, your alignment shifts one step toward evil.

Corruption Stage 2: The second time you engage in such an act, your alignment shifts another step toward evil, you take on a sickly pallor, and your pupils turn dark red.

Corruption Stage 3: The third time you engage in such an act, evil behavior becomes a casual part of your actions and you think nothing of the suffering caused to bring about your goals-after all, it will be worth it. However, you might lose sight of your original purpose in favor of mean-spiritedness. You become an NPC under the GM's control.


Removing the Corruption

This corruption is difficult to remove, since it is based in part on your self-delusions. You must first be convinced that you are going too far to achieve your goal, and even then, full recovery requires atoning (as per atonement) or going through a similar redemptive arc, with the potential of remission subject to the GM's discretion.


Manifestations

The following are manifestations of the amoral corruption.


Clandestine Dealings

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 20</a>
You begin to see the value in the methods of your enemies, and this intrigues them.
Gift: When you attempt a Diplomacy check to influence the attitude of an unfriendly or hostile creature, the DC is reduced by 5.
Stain: The hypocrisy of your methods begins to catch up with you. Good-aligned weapons and damaging effects deal one additional die of damage to you, even if your current alignment is good. (For example, a +1 <a href="magicweaponsdisplay86e5.html?ItemName=Holy">holy</a> longsword deals 2d8+1 points of damage to you if you are not evil, and it deals 2d8+2d6+1 points of damage to you if you are evil.)


Evidence Eraser

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
You fear discovery of your crimes, so you work with obsessive zeal to cover your tracks, though this makes you paranoid.
Gift: You gain a +4 profane bonus on Bluff checks to obscure or destroy evidence, as well as on Stealth checks. At manifestation level 3rd, this bonus becomes +8.
Stain: You constantly second-guess the motives of others. If you attempt a Sense Motive check against a character who is not being deceptive, you must succeed against a DC equal to 15 + your manifestation level or you form some outlandish theory about the character's behavior that paints her as an obstacle to accomplishing your goal.


Evidence Forger

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
You don't care about truth; you care only that the "facts" support your agenda, and you are adept at making such falsehoods seem true.
Prerequisite: Manifestation level 3rd, evidence eraser.
Gift: When attempting a Linguistics or similar check to create a forged piece of evidence, you can roll twice and use the higher result. You can use this gift a number of times per week equal to your manifestation level.
Stain: You can no longer discern between reality and a plausible lie. Whenever you attempt either a Will saving throw to disbelieve an illusion or an opposed Sense Motive check, you roll twice and take the lower result.


Forbidden Magic

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
You find your magic to be insufficient for reaching your goal, so you begin to draw from darker sources.
Prerequisite: Manifestation level 3rd.
Gift: When you are the target of a damaging or healing spell, before the damage or healing is rolled, you can choose to take one fewer die of damage (for a damaging spell) or add one die of healing (for a healing spell).
Stain: Each time you use forbidden magic's gift, you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or you progress to the next corruption stage.


Greater Clandestine Dealings

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
Fiends have taken notice of your wavering beliefs, and they seek to entice you.
Prerequisite: Manifestation level 3rd, clandestine dealings.
Gift: The benefits of clandestine dealings also apply to evil outsiders, regardless of their initial attitude. Furthermore, such outsiders are always willing to offer bargains, whether they are encountered normally or called by planar binding or similar methods.
Stain: You count as evil for the purposes of spells that have alignment-based effects.


Overwhelming Hate

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
You cannot abide those who would oppose your goals-the very thought makes your blood boil.
Prerequisite: Manifestation level 6th.
Gift: Once per day, you can declare an enemy to be a threat to your goal, allowing you to add your manifestation level as a bonus on damage rolls against that enemy. At manifestation level 8th, this extra damage is doubled.
Stain: When you encounter a significant setback in reaching your goal (as determined by the GM), you must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). On a failure, you attempt to take revenge on the party you consider responsible within the next few days, and your corruption progresses to the next stage.


Self-Righteous Fury

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
Your fury at being vexed knows no bounds, and you sometimes slip into violent rages.
Prerequisite: Manifestation level 6th.
Gift: Three times per day, you can gain the benefits of the <a href="spelldisplay77eb.html?ItemName=rage">rage</a> spell with a caster level equal to your manifestation level. At manifestation level 8th, you also gain the benefits of the <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a> spell for as long as your rage lasts.
Stain: Your temper is difficult to control. Whenever you fail an ability check or skill check by 5 or more, you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or you immediately lash out at a creature or object involved in the situation (determined randomly if there are multiple targets), attacking it with a weapon or otherwise attempting to damage it. You are not compelled to continue attacking the target.


Sociopathic Liar

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
You have become so adept at spinning mistruths that it becomes nearly impossible for others to understand your true motives.
Gift: Whenever you attempt a Bluff check to lie, you gain a +4 bonus on the check. At manifestation level 3rd, this bonus increases to +8.
Stain: Whenever you are telling the truth and a creature attempts a Sense Motive check, the creature suspects you are lying regardless of the check's result.


Sudden Betrayal

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s2i?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Antiheros-Handbook">Antihero's Handbook pg. 21</a>
Your allies never suspect that you will betray them in an instant if they get in your way.
Prerequisite: Manifestation level 6th.
Gift: When you initiate combat against your allies, each one is staggered for the first normal round of combat.
Stain: You don't count other creatures as allies for the purposes of abilities and effects that don't directly target them (excluding the gift of this manifestation).
