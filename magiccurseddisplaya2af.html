Description

This pistol acts as a normal +2 pistol, but it has a strange
aversion to talk of peace. Anytime the wielder or an ally within
line of sight that the wielder can hear attempts to improve
a creature's initial attitude with the Diplomacy skill, without
spending an action, the pistol leaps into the wielder's hand
and takes a single shot at the creature the wielder or ally is
using Diplomacy against. If the wielder or ally is attempting
to affect multiple creatures, the gun shoots a random member
of the group. This occurs even if the pistol is unloaded, as the
pistol's curse magically loads itself with a normal bullet and
black powder when the action is taken.
