You and your animal companion work together to make coordinated strikes against your enemies.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, must have or be an animal companion.

Benefit: Once per round while using this style, when an ally with this feat hits a target that you both threaten using a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus on attacks of opportunity made against that target for 1 round. Enemies that provoke attacks of opportunity from your ally also provoke attacks of opportunity from you so long as you threaten them (even if the situation or an ability would normally deny you the attack of opportunity).

Special: Animal companions with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can take this feat.
