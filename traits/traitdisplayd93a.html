Requirement(s) Minata
The hidden coves and bays of the island of Belem have been your home throughout most of your career as a pirate, and the winding waterways of Minata have trained you well in the art of sailing. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks and Profession (sailor) checks, and one of these skills becomes a class skill for you.
