Category Basic (Faith)
You were raised with heretical views
that have made it difficult for you to accept most religious
beliefs and often caused you or those you love to be treated
as pariahs. As a result, you have turned your back on
religious teachings. As long as you do not
possess any levels in a class that grants
divine spellcasting power, you gain
a +1 trait bonus on all saving
throws against divine spells.
