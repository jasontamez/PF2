You have long served at a temple
in a city, where you picked up on many of the nobility's
customs in addition to spending much time in the temple
libraries studying your faith. You gain a +1 trait bonus
on Knowledge (nobility) and Knowledge (religion) checks,
and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill
for you.
