You are a member of one of Magnimar's wealthiest families' or rather, you used to be. A falling-out left you disowned and disinherited. Now you hope to get away from the city and find fortune enough to shame your former kinsfolk-goals which led you to the Pathfinder Society. Despite your exile, your name still carries considerable weight in Magnimar, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made within the city. Additionally, you start play with a noble's outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. Your last name is probably Derexhi, Kaddren, Mindurian, Niroden, Scarnetti, Valdemar, Vanderale, or Versade (but may be another of your choosing; see Magnimar, City of Monuments).
