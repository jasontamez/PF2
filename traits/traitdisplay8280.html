Requirement(s) Plane of Water
Your long years of studious research into the drifting trade city of Vialesk, a neutral ground for planar travelers on the Elemental Plane of Water, has made you an expert on all manner of aquatic creatures. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks to identify outsiders with the water subtype. In addition, you treat your caster level as 1 higher when casting conjuration (summoning) spells to summon outsiders with the water subtype.
