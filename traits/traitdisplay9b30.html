Requirement(s) Vildeis
You were slain by evil forces as a child, but a follower of Vildeis restored you to life. Now you live on in service to the Cardinal Martyr, battling the forces of evil so no other child will know the icy grip of death. You gain a +2 trait bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits against any creature that has at least a faint evil aura (see detect evil).
