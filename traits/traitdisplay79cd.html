You have an innate talent for using
magical weaponry and those weapons capable of becoming
magical. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Craft checks made
to craft magic or masterwork weapons. In addition, when
you use your arcane pool class ability to grant a weapon
an enhancement bonus, that bonus lasts for 2 minutes
instead of 1.
