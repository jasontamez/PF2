Requirement(s) Characters from Qadira who have had family members, neighbors, or friends affected by Taldan aggression or who have fallen victim to this hatred themselves.
You have spent your adult life waiting for Taldor to give you an excuse to fight. You gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks, and if you are able to act during the surprise round of an encounter, you can draw a weapon (but not a potion or magic item) as a free action during that round.
