Requirement(s) Bard who hails from the Shackles or who has lived there for at least 1 year
Abandoned by a traditional healer at a critical time, you improvised a tale or jokes to keep up the spirits of someone in dire health. Once per day as a standard action, you can attempt a DC 15 Perform check with an audible component (such as comedy, oratory, sing, or with any instrument) to stabilize a dying creature that can hear you within 30 feet. You can also attempt Perform checks instead of Heal checks to provide long-term care.
