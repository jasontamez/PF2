Category Race
Requirement(s) Human-Ombo
You may never have participated in a single slave raid, but members of other tribes recognize you as Ombo, and they fear and distrust you accordingly. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Intimidate checks to influence non-Ombo Mwangi, but you suffer a -2 penalty on Bluff or Diplomacy checks to influence them.
