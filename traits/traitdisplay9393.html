Category Basic (Faith)
You have spent many years studying the tenets of your faith, and now believe that the dominant factions within the church have deviated from its true meaning and purpose. Rather than breaking with your misguided church, you've decided to stand up and fight to reform the organization you love. You have fervently studied scripture and steeled your will to combat the divergent beliefs of your peers. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks that pertain to your own religion or spiritual practice, and you gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against spells cast by others who worship your god or adhere to your philosophy.
