You inherit your forebears' ability to fight off terror with bragging or insults. As a swift action, when you have the frightened condition, you can function as if you only have the shaken condition for 1 round by shouting at the source of your fear. You must be able to see the source of the fear condition. You can use this trait only once per fear effect. This trait grants no benefits against the shaken or panicked conditions.
