You were introduced to an individualistic belief as a youth. Thriving under the promise of control of your own destiny, you soon began to demonstrate the truth of this ideal. Though others may mock you for your unwillingness to go along with a group or accept the easy security and comfort promised by more ecclesiastical faiths, you know that the revelations and destiny you seek can only be brought about through your own actions and individual search for meaning. Once per day, after you roll a saving throw against a compulsion effect, you can choose to roll again as an immediate action before the result of the saving throw is announced. You must keep the new roll, even if it is worse.
