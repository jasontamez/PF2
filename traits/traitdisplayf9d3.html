You might face dangerous situations with bravado, but you are constantly afraid. Your base speed when frightened and fleeing increases by 5 feet, and the penalties you take from having the cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken conditions increase by 1. If you would normally be immune to fear, you do not take these penalties but instead lose your immunity to fear (regardless of its source).
