The rumble in your voice and the spark in your eyes hint at a lineage of lightning and thunder, possibly tracing back to lightning elementals from the Plane of Air, or else to a magic-touched birth during a powerful thunderstorm. Once per day when you cast a spell that deals electricity damage, you can choose to make half of the damage electricity damage and the other half sonic damage.
