As a result of your attempts to understand a rare encounter with the unearthly divine magic or secretive movements of coastdwelling giants, you have learned to carefully consider all facts related to a mystery and form deductions after taking time to mull over an unanswered question. Whenever you fail a Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (religion) check, you can attempt the check again in 24 hours with a +2 bonus to represent your careful formation of a new deduction. Additionally, you can attempt such skill checks untrained when the checks involve giants.

Likely Regions: Katapesh, Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Mwangi Expanse, Rahadoum, the Shackles, Varisia.
