You inherited your janni parent's knack for reversing a tense situation. Once per day, you can treat an Intimidate roll to improve a creature's attitude toward you as if you had used Diplomacy instead. You must use this ability after making the check but before the GM has revealed the result. If you continue threatening the target after making the check, the check automatically fails.
