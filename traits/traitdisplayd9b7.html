Much of Kintargo's history is lost or hidden. You know because you've made a point of seeking out those secrets. Local urban legends and bits of strange historical rumors have long fascinated you-who knows what amazing truths about Kintargo's past have been lost forever to the redactors of House Thrune? What caused Professor Mangvhune of the Alabaster Academy to become the city's most infamous serial killer? Who were the dragons Adrakash, Ithanothaur, and Rivozair, and what were their ties to Kintargo? Why do the Devil's Bells of the Temple of Asmodeus seem to ring at random times, and is there a pattern to the peals? Who were the Silver Ravens who defended Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, and why did they vanish so soon after that war's resolution? So many mysteries, and who better than you to find the answers?

Pick one of the questions above as your focus. Answers to these questions can be discovered at different points during Hell's Rebels, but don't expect to learn these answers any time soon! More important, your choice of focus grants you a +1 trait bonus in a particular Knowledge skill check associated with that focus (pick one of the two options provided below for your question). That Knowledge skill is always a class skill for you. Once per day, when you attempt a Knowledge skill check in either of the types associated with your focus, you can roll twice and take the better result as your actual result.

Devil's Bells: Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (planes).
Local Dragons: Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history).
Professor Mangvhune: Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (planes).
Silver Ravens: Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (history).
