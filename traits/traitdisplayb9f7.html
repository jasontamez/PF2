Whether from working with dwarven merchants or being one yourself, you've developed a distinctly dwarven business sense. You receive a +2 trait bonus on Perception checks to notice coins, gems, jewelry, and valuable trade goods. You gain a chance to notice such goods whenever you pass within 10 feet of them, whether or not you are actively looking.
