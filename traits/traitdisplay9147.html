Blessed with good looks, you've come to
depend on the fact that others find you attractive. You
gain a +1 trait bonus when you use Bluff or Diplomacy
on a character that is (or could be) sexually attracted to
you, and a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of any language-dependent
spell you cast on such characters or creatures.
