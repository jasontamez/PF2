You are sensitive to the presence of all elements, allowing you to find water, landmarks, and evidence of prior camps or settlements. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks. Whenever you succeed at a Survival check to follow tracks in desert terrain, you can always tell how long ago the tracks were made (though supernatural abilities and spells still impede this ability as appropriate).
