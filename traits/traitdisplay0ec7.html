Your eidolon-and your connection
to it-makes others ill at ease. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
Intimidate checks, and Intimidate is always a class skill
for you. In addition, if your eidolon is summoned and
within 30 feet, and its size exceeds your own, use its size
modifier on any Intimidate checks you make.
