Whether you were on your way to becoming a drow slave or slated for the ghoul chattel pits, you very narrowly avoided a life of miserable captivity. You make a habit of avoiding restraints or tight spaces, gaining a +1 trait bonus on Escape Artist checks and a +2 trait bonus to CMD to avoid being pinned.
