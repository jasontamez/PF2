A portion of your ancestor's fell curse still courses through your blood. Once per day as a standard action, you can share a portion of your accursed heritage with a willing ally by dealing 1 point of damage to that ally with a natural weapon. The ally gains a natural bite attack, as if from your skinwalker ability, for 2 rounds.
