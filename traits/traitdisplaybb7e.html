Requirement(s) [Halfling] Isger
Everyone in Isger knows how to make do with substandard equipment, and you can improvise tools and materials in order to keep a damaged object working for just a little bit longer. Once per day, you can tinker with a broken object to allow anyone who uses it to ignore the penalties for its broken condition for 24 hours (this does not affect the object's hit points). At the end of this time, it regains the broken condition (but you can use this trait on it over and over again).
