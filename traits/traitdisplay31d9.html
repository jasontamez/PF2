Category Basic (Combat)
Divine powers smile upon you each
time you grievously wound a favored enemy. When you
confirm a critical hit against a favored enemy, you may
extend the duration of any divine spell affecting you by
1 round. The benefits from multiple critical hits stack.
Divine spells with an instantaneous duration can't be
extended in this manner.
