That which has marked you for power has also given you proof to show others. You may cast light three times per day as a spell-like ability, but this ability only targets the palm of your hand, and it manifests as a glowing sigil representing your ominous birth-a holy or unholy symbol, a demonic symbol, or perhaps some other distinctive marking established by you and your GM. Those who recognize this symbol have a starting attitude toward you of one step closer to friendly (if they are followers of or scholars studying the sign) or one step closer to hostile (if they are opposed to the sign or its followers).
