Requirement(s) Goblin
You are a repulsive little freak whose origins are unclear. Your head is small for a goblin and your mouth oddly narrow, allowing you to pass in urban environments as an unidentifiable mongrel, providing you keep a low profile. However, if examined closely, your goblin origins are revealed. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks, and Disguise is a class skill for you.
