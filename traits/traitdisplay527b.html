You are determined to ward off the Bleaching, and get a certain thrill out of being forced to experience negative emotions. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against a spell with the emotion descriptor (see Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic), you can gain 1d6 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.
