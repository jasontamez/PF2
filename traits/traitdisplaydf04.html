You were rewarded as a child for flaunting
your victory over others as completely as possible, and you
discovered you enjoyed the feeling of rubbing your foes'
faces in the dirt. Whenever you are engaged in combat and
there are dying or helpless foes within 30 feet, you take a -2
penalty on attack rolls against foes who are neither dying
nor helpless.
