You discovered or were given a secret
to make your mutagens more unstable-but also more
potent. Once per day, you can create an unstable mutagen.
It is like a normal mutagen in most ways, but also gains a
single benefit or hindrance due to its instability. Roll 1d6
to determine the result of the instability.

<table class="inner">
<tr><td>d6</td><td>Result</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>The unstable mutagen lasts for 5 minutes per
alchemist level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The unstable mutagen lasts for 20 minutes per
alchemist level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The unstable mutagen does not grant a natural
armor bonus.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>The natural armor bonus granted by the
mutagen increases by 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The penalty that the mutagen applies to the
corresponding mental ability score increases by 2.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The unstable mutagen does not apply a penalty
to the corresponding mental ability score.</td></tr>
