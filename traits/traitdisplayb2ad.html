One of your parents was a gifted
spellcaster who not only used metamagic often, but also
developed many magical items and perhaps even a new
spell or two-and you have inherited a fragment of this
greatness. Pick one spell when you choose this trait.
When you apply metamagic feats to this spell that add at
least 1 level to the spell, treat its actual level as 1 lower for
determining the spell's final adjusted level.
