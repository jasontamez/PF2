Requirement(s) The Shackles
You are used to sailing in the terrible winds that roll out from the Eye of Abendego, and can apply the skills you've learned to any storm. You treat wind effects as one wind force category less than they actually are, both for any personal checks you must make and for any you make to captain or steer a ship.
