You have learned how to work a crowd in Magnimar's mock-gladiator fights. Choose one weapon. You take no penalty on attack rolls when dealing nonlethal damage with that weapon, and once per day if you score a critical hit with the weapon, you can immediately attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize your target.
