Category Basic (Combat)
You have a strong
sense of self-preservation, believing it is more
important to safely extract yourself from a fight that has turned hopeless than to stubbornly stand your
ground and risk death-for when you're dead, you can't
protect the innocent. When using the withdraw action,
both the first and second squares of your movement are
not considered threatened by any opponents you can see,
rather than just the first square.
