Requirement(s) Mwangi shamanistic faith
You are a devotee of the shamanistic practices of the Mwangi, having little use for the deities of the colonials. You gain a +1 racial bonus on Will saves against divine spells and spell-like effects employed against you by clerics or paladins of Aroden, Abadar, Iomedae, Gozreh, and Shelyn-but you suffer a -1 penalty on Will saves against divine spells cast by devotees of Mwangi faiths.
