Requirement(s) Kitsune
You are talented with kitsune magic. You gain a +1 trait bonus on caster level checks for your racial spell-like abilities as well as those from the Magical Tail feat (Advanced Race Guide 193). Additionally, you can select Magical Tail as a bonus feat whenever your favored class grants you a bonus bloodline feat, combat feat, or metamagic feat instead of the normal type of feat granted by that class. You cannot exchange specific feats granted by a class or race for Magical Tail in this manner; for instance, a monk cannot exchange his Stunning Fist feat for Magical Tail.
