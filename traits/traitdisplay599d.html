You grew up in a culture where the touch of totem spirits was felt in everyday life, their subtle urgings constantly guiding you and keeping you safe. As a result, you learned quickly to ask for their help when trouble arises. Once per day, you may call upon your totem's wisdom as a standard action. You gain the benefits of guidance, except that the granted competence bonus is equal to half your character level (minimum +1). This is a supernatural ability.
