Requirement(s) Nirmathas
You have spent many years living under the canopy of the Southern Fangwood, during which you and your comrades clashed regularly with the soldiers of imperialist Molthune. After years of guerrilla warfare, you've learned to interpret the sounds of the forest to detect signs of enemies. You gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks when in a forest. Once per day when in a forest, you can designate yourself or an ally to roll twice for initiative and take either result.
