You feed intelligence to the Thrice-Damned House of Thrune for your own gain or ideological reasons and are given valuable clues gathered by other Chelish spies in exchange. Once per month while in an Inner Sea region settlement of at least 2,000 people, you can call upon these connections to gain an edge in a verbal duel (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 176) or gain a +2 bonus on one Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check.
