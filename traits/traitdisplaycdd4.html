Weapon of Peace

Category Basic (Combat)
Even though you are
a trained combatant, proficient with any number of
weapons, you don't relish killing your enemies. It's
not that you're afraid of seeing blood, but rather that
disabling a foe is superior to killing someone capable of
admitting defeat. When using a melee weapon that deals
lethal damage to instead deal nonlethal damage, you take
only a -2 penalty instead of -4.
