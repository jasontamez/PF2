You've always found yourself
in positions where others look up to you as a leader,
and you can distinctly remember an event from your
early childhood where you led several other children to
accomplish a goal that each of you individually could not. All cohorts, followers, or summoned creatures under your
leadership gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves to avoid
mind-affecting effects. If you ever take the Leadership
feat, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your Leadership score.
