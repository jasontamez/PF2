You've sat on your favorite barstool at the Rusty Dragon every night for as long as you can remember- and some nights you can't remember thanks to a few too many drinks. In your various hazes, You've gotten to know the tap house's proprietor, Ameiko, or one of her regulars, Sandru, quite well. Additionally, you're well acquainted with a variety of uses for strong drink. Any time you have an alcoholic beverage on hand, you can expend one use of it to grant you a +2 trait bonus on a Heal check. This bonus increases to +4 if you're treating your favorite drinking buddy (your NPC of choice). NPC Choices: Ameiko, Sandru.
