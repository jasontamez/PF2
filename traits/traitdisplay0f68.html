Category Drawback
You were touched by terrible horrors
that live in the darkness just outside the human sphere,
such as shadow-beasts or aberrations linked to the Dark
Tapestry, and feel your life-force ebb away ever so slightly
whenever you return to the shadows. Whenever you are in
an area of dim light or darkness, you take a -1 penalty
on saving throws.
