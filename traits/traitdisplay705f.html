Category Basic (Combat)
As a youth, you often leaped and ran
at treacherous heights, either because it was the only
place with enough freedom for you to play or because it
was not a good idea to play any lower. You gain a +2 trait
bonus on Acrobatics checks to keep your balance or jump,
and Acrobatics becomes a class skill for you.

Suggested Characters: Chelaxians, gnomes, Korvosans.
