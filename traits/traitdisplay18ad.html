Requirement(s) Shizuru
You come from an especially esteemed family, religious order, school, or other group that worships Shizuru, and draw upon that tradition to maintain your identity. The first time each day that you fail a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, you can reroll that saving throw. If you do so, you gain a +2 trait bonus on this roll and use this result as the actual result for that saving throw.
