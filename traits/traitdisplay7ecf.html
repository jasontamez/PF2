Exposure
to the constant hazards of airborne particles (such as during
a sandstorm or cave-in) has made your eyes less susceptible to
irritants, such as sand, dust, and even liquids and gases. You
gain a +2 trait bonus against being blinded by foreign objects
(such as from a Dirty Trick combat maneuver) and you halve
any reductions in visibility from the environment (such as
from certain storms) and their corresponding penalties. For
example, if you were in a sandstorm that normally reduces
visibility to 25 feet and imparts a -4 penalty on Perception
checks, you reduce visibility to 50 feet and take only a -2
penalty on Perception checks.
