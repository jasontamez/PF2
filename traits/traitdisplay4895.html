Requirement(s) Osirion
You see the interactions between elementals as the epitome of balance; you've studied the traditional elemental bindings of Ancient Osirion and can draw upon their power. As an immediate action, once per day when you cast a spell with the air, earth, fire, or water descriptor, you can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell's level. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
