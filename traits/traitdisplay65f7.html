Category Drawback
After suffering terribly for not being tightlipped
enough as a child, such as when you accidentally
exposed your family to enemy inquisitors, you developed
a habit of being overly cautious with your words. You
take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy checks and must speak
slowly due to the concentration required. Unless stated
otherwise, you are assumed to not be speaking at a
volume above a whisper.
