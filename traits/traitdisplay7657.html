Category Campaign
You were raised deep in the Fangwood Forest, but in your childhood the Darkblight overtook your community, and blighted fey attacked your friends and family. Even after escaping, you barely survived infection by the otherworldly fungal disease and still bear a terrible scar from your ordeal. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws against disease or poison (your choice), and your scar now throbs painfully in the presence of unnatural creatures, immediately alerting you to their presence. This sixth sense alerts you to the presence of aberrations, oozes, and all creatures with the <a href="monsterdisplaye67b.html?ItemName=Blighted%20Fey%20(Satyr)">blighted fey</a> and <a href="monsterdisplay9258.html?ItemName=Fungal%20Nymph">fungal creature</a> templates within 30 feet (though it doesn't indicate their exact location). You can always act during the surprise round against such creatures, and you aren't considered flat-footed against such creatures in the first round of combat.
