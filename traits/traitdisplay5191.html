You were raised, either wholly or in part,
by a magical creature, either after it found you abandoned
in the woods or because your parents often left you in
the care of a magical minion. This constant exposure to
magic has made its mysteries easy for you to understand,
even when you turn your mind to other devotions and
tasks. Pick a class when you gain this trait-your caster
level in that class gains a +2 trait bonus as long as this
bonus doesn't raise your caster level above your current
Hit Dice.
