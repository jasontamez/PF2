Category Basic (Combat)
As a child, you learned the power of a simple
expression of faith in another when you gave a hero the
inspiration to fight on in the face of terrible odds and
save you from danger. As a standard action, you can speak
words of encouragement to grant a +1 morale bonus to an
ally within 30 feet who can see and hear you. The ally can
use this bonus on any d20 roll of her choice before the
start of your next turn. You cannot use this trait to grant
a bonus to yourself or to an ally who has already benefited
from this trait within the last 24 hours.

Suggested Characters: Eagle Knights, Iomedaeans,
Mendevian crusaders.
