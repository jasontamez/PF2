Category Drawback
You draw magical power from a source, such as a mysterious eidolon, shame-filled phantom, or First World patron, who insists that its identity remains secret. You take a -1 penalty on concentration checks, and you must invoke the entity's name by word or text each day or be unable to regain spell slots that day. You must be able to cast 0-level and 1st-level spells as a class feature to select this drawback.
