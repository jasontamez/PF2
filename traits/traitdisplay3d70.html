You enjoy luring slave ships to you. Sometimes you run a pirate flag to lull criminals into a false sense of security; other times you disguise yourself as a merchant ship. You gain a +2 bonus on Disguise checks made to disguise yourself as a pirate or merchant sailor. In addition, you can take 5 minutes to alter your ship's appearance to add +2 to the DC of any check made to identify your ship's allegiance or purpose.
