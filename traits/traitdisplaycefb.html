As a follower of Razmir, the Prophecies of Kalistrade, or some other tradition that preaches self-reliance, you make a point of not seeking divine aid for minor matters. When you gain this trait, choose one of the following 0-level spells: create water, mending, purify food and drink, or stabilize.
