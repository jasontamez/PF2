You are learned in the secret lore of the forge, rituals handed down for generations that some say come from Torag himself. Whenever you use the Craft skill or a crafting feat to make a stone or metal item, you reduce the cost of making the item by 5%. This includes metal-headed weapons with nonmetal parts, such as axes and spears.
