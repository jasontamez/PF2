Requirement(s) Sarenrae
In order to maintain your devotion to Sarenrae in Taldor and stay alive, you and your fellow worshipers developed a complex system of hand signs and facial gestures to identify yourselves as faithful in the Cult of the Dawnflower. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff and Sense Motive checks. One of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
