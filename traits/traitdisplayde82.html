You're going to win the Golden Goblin's upcoming "Cheat the Devil and Take His Gold" tournament one way or the other. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Profession (gambling) checks, and creatures searching you for objects hidden on your body don't gain the usual +4 bonus on their Perception checks. Additionally, you begin play with a "fixed" six-sided die (it has two -6s' and no -1-) and a dagger.
