Category Basic (Combat)
You know that you could be exposed at any time. Even your closest friends could someday become enemies, and so you have trained yourself to never be surprised by a betrayal. At the beginning of combat, before initiative checks are revealed, you can select one opponent you are aware of to be the subject of this trait. If you succeed at a Wisdom check opposed by the subject's initiative check, you are not considered flat-footed against this subject for this combat, even if you normally would be. You can use this trait in a surprise round, even if you cannot otherwise act that round.
