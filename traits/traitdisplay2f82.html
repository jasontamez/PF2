Requirement(s) Iobaria
Your nomadic tribe
wanders the Ice Steppes of Iobaria. They live in constant
fear of the great white wyrm Sjohvornor and feel helpless
to stop the dragon's aggression. Your tribe is filled with
wise sages and great warriors, and they resent being
cowed by any foe. You vowed that one day you would not
have to be afraid of Sjohvornor or any other wyrm. You
gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against any dragon's
frightful presence.
