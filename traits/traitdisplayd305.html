You've been a slave your whole life, and have passed from master to master more times than you can count. Some of those masters were cruel, others kindly. In all cases, You've yearned to be free. When your most recent master fell on hard times, he sold many of his slaves to the city government, and as luck would have it, a recent opportunity to earn your freedom has manifested. The Pactmasters of Katapesh are looking to revitalize an old trade route to Osirion, and a band of mercenaries and guards is gathering to go out and supplement forces already in place near the ruined village of Kelmarane, now said to be infested by gnolls. You've secured a place among those mercenaries, under the watchful eye of Garavel. If you help in retaking Kelmarane, You've been promised your freedom. In any event, your life as a slave has toughened you and made you more resistant to hardship. Choose one of the three categories of saving throw; you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws of that type.
