Requirement(s) Half-Orc
Most people expect half-orcs to be savage and violent, and you're used to working a little harder to overcome their assumptions. Unfortunately, you're still working on keeping patient when they ignore your efforts. Once per day, you may choose to gain a +5 trait bonus on any Diplomacy check, but if it fails, you take a -2 penalty on all Charisma-based checks for the next 10 minutes.
