You have
always been intrigued by magic,
possibly because you were the child
of a magician or priest. You often snuck
into your parent's laboratory or shrine
to tinker with spell components and magic devices, and
frequently caused quite a bit of damage and headaches
for your parent as a result. You gain a +1 bonus on Use
Magic Device checks, and Use Magic Device is always a
class skill for you.
