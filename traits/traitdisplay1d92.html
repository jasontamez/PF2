You are one of the few remaining descendants of the lost civilization of Lirgen. Growing up learning of your people's history has granted you a fine understanding of celestial divination as well as a deep-seated hatred of the demon-worshiping monsters that have come to rule your ancestral lands. While under starlight, the caster level of all your divination spells is increased by 1. If the target of your spell is a demon, the caster level is increased by 2.
