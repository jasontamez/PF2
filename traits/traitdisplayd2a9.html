Either your parents sent you to be raised in a monastery, or you traveled there yourself later in life in order to escape the conf lict and distractions of the greater world. There you learned to eschew the material concerns that plague so many and cloud their minds, instead embracing an ascetic lifestyle. You readily let go and step away from trouble, free from any tie or baggage that might slow your path to enlightenment-figuratively or literally. Once per day as a swift action, you gain a +1 trait bonus to Armor Class as long as you are wearing no armor, not using a shield, carrying a light load, and have nothing in your hands. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.
