You are born under the auspice of the mounted caravan guard, whose very presence deters danger. Once per day, when you succeed at a Ride check, you can attempt an immediate Intimidate check against the nearest foe. If you fail this check, the DC of your next Intimidate check against that opponent does not increase (as it normally would).
