Your nomadic culture gives you a profound knowledge of and respect for the horses that roam your homelands. You begin play with a combat trained light horse (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 177). While riding this horse bareback, you are treated as though you were riding it with a riding saddle (placing any actual saddle upon the horse negates this benefit). The horse can fend for itself outside of settlements in all but the most hostile environments. If whistled for outside of a community, the horse typically arrives within 1d6 minutes. If your horse is slain, you may receive a new horse by returning to your clan and performing a vigil for its spirit (a rite that costs 100 gp in rare herbs and incense).
