Digging
tunnels near a body of rushing water has taught you how to
use water as a means of travel and escape. Others whisper that
you must have been born with webbed feet. You gain a +1 trait
bonus on Swim checks, and Swim is always a class skill for
you. You increase the speed of any raft, barge, keelboat, or
rowboat you pilot by 4 miles per day (1/2 mile per hour).
