Your belief in reincarnation, as taught by the Sangpotshi philosophy and in lands that were once Imperial Lung Wa, has been reinforced by personal experience. In moments of great stress, you sometimes experience flashes of d??j?? vu in which you recall information you don't remember ever having known. Once per day while you are in danger or distracted, you gain a +3 bonus on a single Knowledge skill check.
