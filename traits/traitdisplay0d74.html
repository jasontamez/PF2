Through pacts with eldritch beings or a simple quirk of circumstance, your voice has an uncanny rapport with those swept up in madness. Once per day as an immediate action, you can issue a command to a confused creature within 30 feet. This allows the creature to immediately reroll on the confused condition table on page 566 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, and you can pick which of the two actions-the action of its initial roll or that of the reroll-the creature takes. Confused creatures do not need to understand you for this trait to take effect.
