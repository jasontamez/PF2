Category Basic (Combat)
You are dedicated to defending members
of your family. When you use the aid another action to give a
member of your family a bonus to AC, increase the bonus by
2. This increase is a trait bonus (and therefore doesn't stack
with increases granted by other family members using this
trait). This trait has no effect when using the aid another
action to increase a family member's next attack roll.
