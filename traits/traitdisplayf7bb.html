You maintain a sense of direction, even on planes where direction is relative. If you are on a plane that has no analogue to north, you automatically know the direction toward the plane's major dominating feature (for instance, Pharasma's Spire in the Boneyard, or the sun in Nirvana). If there is no such dominating feature, you instead know the direction of the closest feature significant to one of the plane's divinities or demigods.
