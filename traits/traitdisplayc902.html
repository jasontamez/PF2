You come from a family whose ancestors worked in the platinum mines near Tar Urkatka, now known as Zolurket. Your parents never explained why they've never returned to Zolurket, but they did make sure that you knew your way around a fight against undead foes. You gain a +1 trait bonus to weapon damage against undead.
