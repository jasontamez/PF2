You've always hated dragons. Perhaps one of your ancestors was a well-known dragonslayer, or a rampaging dragon killed your family or friends. Maybe the stories you grew up hearing about knights rescuing captive princes and princesses from the clutches of evil dragons inspired you to slay dragons. Whatever the reason for your obsession, it has driven you to study how to fight dragons and defend yourself against their fearsome attacks. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against creatures with the dragon type and a +2 trait bonus on Reflex saves against breath weapon attacks.
