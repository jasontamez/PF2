Category Campaign
No crime is too despicable for Gaedren Lamm and his thugs-a gang of lowlife murderers, kidnappers, and drug dealers that operate in Korvosa's Midland district. You've lost someone to Lamm and now you're out for revenge. While Lamm remains alive and free, you are not slain until your hit point total reaches a negative number equal to your Constitution score + 3. Once Lamm is imprisoned or killed, you lose the former benefit but gain 3 permanent hit points.
