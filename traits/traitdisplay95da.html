Requirement(s) Undine
Your tight-knit undine community helped you practice your water magic safely. Whenever you cast a spell or use a spell-like ability that has the cold or water descriptor and affects an area, you can choose one square within the area. The spell or spell-like ability does not affect that square or creatures in it.
