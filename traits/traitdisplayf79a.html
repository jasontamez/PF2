Category Drawback
You have a strong emotional attachment to  a person or object that you're terrified of losing. The GM  chooses the object of your attachment. Whenever the  object of your attachment is either threatened, in danger, or in someone else's possession, you take a -1 penalty on  Will saves and a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects.  If the person or object to which you're attached is ever  lost, killed, or destroyed, exchange this drawback for the  Doubt drawback.
