You claim a tangential but legitimate connection to one of Brevoy's noble families. If you aren't human, you were likely adopted by one of Brevoy's nobles or were instead a favored servant or even a childhood friend of a noble scion. Whatever the cause, you've had a comfortable life, but one far from the dignity and decadence your distant cousins know. Although you are associated with an esteemed name, your immediate family is hardly well to do, and you've found your name to be more of a burden to you than a boon in many social situations. you've recently decided to test yourself, to see if you can face the world without the aegis of a name you have little real claim or care for. An expedition into the storied Stolen Lands seems like just the test to see if you really are worth the title "noble." Choose one of the following noble families and associated benefits.
