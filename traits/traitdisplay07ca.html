Requirement(s) Katapesh
You spent a portion of your childhood working for the Duskwalkers, the guild responsible for policing and watching over all trade that takes place in Katapesh's notorious Nightstalls. You have quite a bit more spending cash than most others of your age as a result, and start with twice the normal amount of starting gold. In addition, your reputation remains strong in the Nightstalls, and any transactions you make there are always beneficial to you; items you sell net you an additional 10% profit, and items you purchase there are 10% cheaper than normal. This discount also applies to your starting gear.
