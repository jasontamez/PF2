Category Basic (Combat)
When deprived
of magic, you fight harder. You gain
a +1 trait bonus on weapon attack
and damage rolls while within
an area of antimagic such as that
created by an antimagic field. You also
gain this bonus for 1 round after you are
subject to an area or targeted dispel magic
spell, regardless of the effect's success
or failure in dispelling your spells
and magical effects.
