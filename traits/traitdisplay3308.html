Your faith teaches you to push magical servants to the limit. When you cast a spell that creates a loyal servant to fulfill a specific or mindless task (such as unseen servant, mount, or spiritual weapon, but not summon monster spells), you may choose to increase its duration by 50%. This does not stack with the Extend Spell feat. The effect weakens the spell, however; dispel checks against spells you cast in this manner gain a +4 bonus.
