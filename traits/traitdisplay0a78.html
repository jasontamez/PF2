Category Basic (Combat)
You were trained from a young age to ambush the enemies of your order or organization, which makes you hard to trust for most outside your organization if they learn your affiliation. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against flat-footed foes, as long as they have not seen you make an attack with this bonus before.
