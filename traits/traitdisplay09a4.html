Requirement(s) Sarkoris or the Worldwound
Having grown up near the Worldwound, you have a rough understanding of the demons' guttural babble. You add Abyssal to your list of languages known, though you take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Bluff checks made while speaking Abyssal, as well as a -2 penalty on Linguistics checks made to read Abyssal text. If you gain Abyssal as a language again at a later time (such as by taking a rank in Linguistics and selecting Abyssal as a learned language), these skill check penalties become +2 trait bonuses instead.
