As a native of the North, you have acquired the ability to tread lightly on snow. You ignore difficult terrain caused by snow, and it costs you only 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered in heavy snow, rather than 4 squares of movement. This benefit only applies when you are not carrying a medium or heavier load.
