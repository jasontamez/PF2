You don't have a place, but the frontier seems comfortable enough for now. Maybe you're too informal for city life, too selfish for Lastwall's general culture of camaraderie, or too scarred by things you've seen to entirely trust another person. You are accustomed to moving without drawing much attention to yourself, gaining a +1 trait bonus on Stealth and Survival checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Accustomed to working alone, you gain only half the benefit (+1) from aid another actions, but you're accustomed to doing the job right the first time and so increase the bonus you provide by 1 when aiding another character.
