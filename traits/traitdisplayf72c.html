Category Drawback
You were publicly linked, truthfully or not, to a crime of significant infamy. You draw attention wherever you go and risk imprisonment or worse in the jurisdiction where the crime was committed. You and your apparent allies take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy checks to interact with law-abiding citizens (except enemies of the authority that accused you).
