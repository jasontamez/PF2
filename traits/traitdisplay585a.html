Requirement(s) Razmiran
You are trained in the methods of Razmir's priesthood, and can use your arcana to fuel minor healing powers. Once per day as a full-round action, you can sacrifice a prepared arcane spell or spell slot to manifest healing magic. This acts as cure light wounds, except you heal 1d6 points of damage per level of the spell or spell slot sacrificed (maximum 5d6) and the hit points healed are temporary (lasting 1 hour).
