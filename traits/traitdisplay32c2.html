You've spent more of your life around animals than people, and find them easier to understand. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Handle Animal checks, and Handle Animal is always a class skill for you. Your trait bonus increases to +5 whenever you attempt to "push" a wild animal to perform a trick for you, so long as its attitude is indifferent or friendlier. You may target creatures of the animal type with charm or compulsion spells as if they were humanoids, but unless you have another ability to make yourself understood to animals, you must still succeed at a Handle Animal check to "push" your target in order to communicate specific requests.
