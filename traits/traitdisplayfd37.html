Category Basic (Social)
Growing up in a land where paranoia
fills the air and any accusation of heresy or dissent can
spell doom for whole families, you learned very quickly
to keep a secret. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks
and a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against divinations,
domination effects, and effects that would compel you to
speak the truth.

Suggested Characters: Chelaxians, Galtans, Nidalese.
