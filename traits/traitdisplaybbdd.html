Rivethun is an ancient tradition of dwarven shamans who learned to listen to and affect the world around them by reflecting on the friction between body and spirit. As someone who feels a similar friction between your inner spirit and physical body, you have picked up some old rivethun meditation techniques, even if you aren't a dwarf. While you suffer a physical ailment, such as disease, poison, or ability damage to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (but not  including hit point damage), you gain a +2 trait bonus on Will saving throws. While you suffer a mental ailment, including insanity, any charm or compulsion effect, or ability damage to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws.
