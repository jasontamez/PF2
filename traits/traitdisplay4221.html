Category Drawback
You had a traumatic
experience with a spirit at a young age
that colors your reactions to such creatures even to this
day. Whenever you perceive a fey, outsider, or undead
from within 60 feet, you become shaken for 1d4 rounds
unless you succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to 15
+ the creature's Charisma modif ier. Immunity to fear
effects does not allow you to forgo this saving throw;
even if you are immune to fear, you must roll the Will
saving throw for this drawback when applicable, albeit
with a +4 bonus.
