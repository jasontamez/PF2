Category Basic (Combat)
You wouldn't have lived to make it
out of childhood without the aid of a sibling, friend,
or companion you could always count on to
distract your enemies long enough for you
to do a little bit more damage than normal.
That companion may be another PC or an
NPC (who may even be recently departed
from your side). When you hit a foe you
are flanking, you deal 1 additional point
of damage (this damage is added to
your base damage, and is multiplied on
a critical hit). This additional damage is a
trait bonus.
