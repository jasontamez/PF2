You felt lost and aimless in your youth until a patron's emotional intervention showed you the power of throwing yourself completely into what you do. Once per day, you can add a +2 trait bonus on any attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. You must choose to apply this bonus before rolling the die. When you use this ability, you take a -2 penalty to your AC and on saving throws until the end of your next turn.
