You were badly burned once by volcanic ash,
torch-wielding mobs, or some fiery accident, and the scars
pain you terribly you whenever you are too near to fire.
You take a -1 penalty on saving throws against fire effects.
In addition, whenever you are adjacent to open flames or
are on fire, you take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, saving
throws, and skill checks until you spend an entire round
away from fire. These penalties are not cumulative. (An
instantaneous fire effect adjacent to you or affecting you
causes this penalty to apply until 1 round after it is gone.)
