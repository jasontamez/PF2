Requirement(s) Gathlain
You can get anyone's attention, even when they are focused elsewhere. You can make Bluff checks to create a diversion for allies within 30 feet to hide (provided they readied an action to hide), and you can make Bluff checks to feint for one adjacent ally of your choice. Either use of this ability is a standard action.
