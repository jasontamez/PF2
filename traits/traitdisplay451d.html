Category Basic (Magic)
A traumatic experience in your childhood, such as surviving a violent earthquake, fleeing a shipwreck, escaping a devastating fire, or getting struck by lightning, caused you to develop a fear of the corresponding element. You can instinctively shield yourself against elemental dangers of that type. Select acid, cold, electricity, or fire at character creation (once chosen, this damage type can't be changed). Once per day when you are subjected to an attack or effect that deals energy damage of that type, you can gain resistance 10 against that damage type for 1 round as an immediate action. This resistance does not stack with any existing resistance you might have against that energy type.
