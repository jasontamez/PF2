Firearms you wield are especially dangerous to you and everyone nearby. Whenever a firearm you wield misfires or explodes, roll a d%. On a result of 1-25, the misfire or explosion is delayed; reroll the attack with a -5 penalty (penalties from the broken condition are not applied to this reroll, and a firearm that was already broken does not explode). After the reroll is resolved, apply the effects of the misfire or explosion as normal. (If the d% roll result is 26 or higher, the misfire or explosion happens as normal.) Whenever a firearm you wield explodes due to a misfire, increase the explosion's damage by 1d6 plus 1d6 for every 4 character levels you have.
