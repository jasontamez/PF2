Your eidolon excels at a movement
type you do not possess. Your eidolon receives a foot
enhancement bonus to one type of speed it has that you
do not, such as a climb or swim speed. If your eidolon doesn't already possess such a mode of movement, you
may apply this trait bonus later if it gains an evolution
that grants it such a mode. Once this bonus is applied to a
mode of movement, it can't be switched to another mode.
