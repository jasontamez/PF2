You are skilled at discovering the true names of outsiders. Choose a plane other than the Material Plane. When attempting to discover the true name of an outsider from the chosen plane, you halve the amount of research time required and gain a +4 trait bonus on the Knowledge (planes) check made to learn the outsider's name. For more information on binding outsiders using their true names, see page 101 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic.
