You grew up around those
who fight the demons streaming out of the Worldwound,
and from their stories you learned about the demons'
weaknesses. You are likely from Mendev or have joined that
nation's cause as a crusader. Once per day when fighting
demons, you gain a +4 trait bonus on a single attack roll.
