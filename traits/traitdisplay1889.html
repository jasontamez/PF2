Requirement(s) Camel
Once per hour, a Keleshite trade camel can regurgitate the contents of its stomach, spitting the foul material at a single target within 10 feet as a ranged touch attack. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the camel's Hit Dice + the camel's Constitution modifier) or be nauseated for 1 round.
