As a child in Magnimar, the city's ancient monuments inspired you with wonder. Your fascination with these relics has only grown in the years since, encouraging you to join the ranks of the Pathfinder Society so you can further quench your thirst for knowledge. Though you know little about the actual lore of the monuments, you've studied these colossal works extensively, developing an in-depth knowledge of some of the city's most famous landmarks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) checks made in Varisia due to your familiarity with its historical remnants. This bonus increases to +2 if the check relates to the city of Magnimar. Additionally, you gain a +2 trait bonus on any skill check made to receive a boon from one of Magnimar's magically imbued monuments (see Magnimar, City of Monuments for more details).
