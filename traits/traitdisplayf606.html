You come from a long line of hale and long-lived people. Growing up, you rarely got sick and had enough energy to run all day if it suited you. You don't get as tired as other people and repeated physical activities don't seem to bother you much. You were selected as part of the expedition because the Bountiful Venture Company saw great importance and promise in your robust health.

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves, Swim checks to prevent nonlethal damage from fatigue after swimming for more than an hour at a time, and Constitution checks to prevent fatigue. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 3 times your Constitution score.
