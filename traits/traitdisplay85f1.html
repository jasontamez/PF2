Requirement(s) Settlement Near a Famous Dungeon
As a youth, you marveled at the crusaders, spelunkers, and lore seekers who came through your town on their way to the nearby dungeon, tomb, or ruins. One such intrepid role model in particular was of great import to you. On the last day you ever saw your hero, the adventurer gave you a unique dungeon guide (see page 14) worth no more than 750 gp and with an accuracy modifier of no greater than +2. Suggestion: With the help of your GM and using the examples in this book, construct a unique dungeon guide tied to the dungeon near where you grew up.
