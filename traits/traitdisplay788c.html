Your intense training with
the Swords has taught you how to infiltrate otherwise
inaccessible ruins and extract their treasures without
too much exertion. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Strength
checks made to break doors and lift portcullises, and
you treat your Strength score as 2 higher for the purpose
of determining your carrying capacity.
