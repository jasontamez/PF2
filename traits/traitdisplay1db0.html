You've always seemed to have trouble keeping money. Worse, you always seem to have debts looming over your head. When you heard about the "Cheat the Devil and Take His Gold" gambling tournament, you felt in your gut that your luck was about to change. You've always been optimistic, in fact, and even though right now is one of those rare times where you don't owe anyone any money (you just paid off a recent loan from local moneylender Lymas Smeed), you know that'll change soon enough. Better to start amassing money now when you're at one of those rare windfall times! You've set aside a gold coin for the entrance fee, and look forward to making it big-you can feel it in your bones! This time's gonna be the big one! Your boundless optimism, even in the face of crushing situations, has always bolstered your spirit. Effects that grant you morale bonuses persist 1d4 rounds longer than they normally would as a result.
