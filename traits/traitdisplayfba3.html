Category Basic (Faith)
You cling tenaciously to a faith that is doubted by many, perhaps based around a god who has vanished, or was never a god in the first place. You refuse to forsake your beliefs despite all evidence, perhaps due to a need to belong, respect for tradition, or a religious experience. As a result, it is nearly impossible to convince you of your deity's absence. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Will saving throws against fear effects.
