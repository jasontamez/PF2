Requirement(s) Plane of Earth
Perhaps you worship the Elemental Lord of Earth, or perhaps you have gleaned your fated powers via some other means of interacting with the Eternal Delve. Your divine powers are infused with the elemental powers of the Plane of Earth. Whenever you channel positive energy to heal living creatures, affected targets gain a +2 profane bonus to CMD to resist bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers. Alternately, if you channel negative energy to harm living creatures, affected targets take a -2 penalty to CMD against such combat maneuvers. This effect lasts 1 round.
