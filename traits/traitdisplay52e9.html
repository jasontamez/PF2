Requirement(s) Elion
You have traveled far with only your compass and faith as your guides. You begin play with a compass, and any compass or wayfinder in your possession also functions as a holy symbol of Elion. Either Knowledge (geography) or Survival becomes a class skill for you. Once per day you can consult your compass or wayfinder as a fullround action to gain a +2 trait bonus on one Knowledge (geography) or Survival check.
