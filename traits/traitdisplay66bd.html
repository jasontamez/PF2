You love your country, its history, and its people... even though they may not love you back. Whether you're a bureaucrat, a minor noble, or a soldier, you want your community to be the best it can be and you channel that love into a position in service to the people of Taldor. You gain a +1 bonus on all Sense Motive and Knowledge (history) checks, and these skills are always class skills for you. In addition, once per day you can recall a specific fact about a Taldan noble's personality-quirks such as a hobby or pet peeve- including information you would normally learn as a discovery check in social combat.
