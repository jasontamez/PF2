You, or perhaps your family, were once worshipers of <a href="deitydisplay813c.html?ItemName=Iomedae">Iomedae</a>, but something happened that made you lose your faith. Perhaps your family was accused of being dishonorable or cowardly, or maybe one of your family members was the victim of church "justice." Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth-that the Inheritor's so-called honor, valor, and justice are just tin plating on a strict dogma that seeks to control people by restricting their free will. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was subjected to scorn and holier-than-thou disapproval. Ever since, you've vowed to some day get revenge against the church of Iomedae-and with the current situation brewing in Cheliax, you might finally have the opportunity.

Choose one: against followers of Iomedae, including many (but not all) archons and angels, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, or you gain a +1 trait bonus on the save DCs of your spells.
