You have put in many hours practicing with flashy alchemical items that enhance your Perform skill. When you use an attention-getting alchemical item such as a flask of alchemist's fire, smokestick, thunderstone, or another appropriate alchemical item (GM's discretion) as part of a performance, you gain a +2 trait bonus on your Perform check for the duration of that performance. The item is expended without its normal effects and only serves to make your performance more impressive; for example, you could pretend to ignite yourself with alchemist's fire as part of a Perform (comedy) check or make a dramatic appearance with a smokestick as part of a Perform (act) check, but you would not actually take fire damage or gain concealment from smoke.
