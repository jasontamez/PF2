The end times are coming, and the shadow in the sky over Riddleport is just the first piece of proof. Convinced that the end of the world is nigh, you've decided to take part in the Golden Goblin's gambling tournament-after all, what do you have to lose? Whenever you roll a -1- on an attack roll, you gain a +1 trait bonus on your next attack roll so long as it is made within 1 minute. You also begin play with a placard bearing an apocalyptic slogan of your choice-this wooden sign can be used as a club.
