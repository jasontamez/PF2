Your study of monsters keeps you well informed. Choose either Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), or Knowledge (nature). Whenever you succeed at a Knowledge check to identify a creature and its special powers-or vulnerabilities-with the chosen skill, you gain one additional piece of useful information (as if your skill check result had been 5 higher).
