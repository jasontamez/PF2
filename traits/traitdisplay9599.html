Perhaps you came to the Varisian Gulf in search of the Sandpoint Devil, or maybe you followed fisherman's tales of Old Murdermaw- regardless, you've ventured through Varisia to hunt down famous monsters. While they have all eluded you so far, you made it to Sandpoint to research and restock before heading back out into the wilderness. Because of your training, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against aberrations and magical beasts.
