Through your detailed study of your own lineage, you can better understand and honor even your most distant relatives. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), and Sense Motive checks associated with any creature who shares your type and at least one of your subtypes.
