You've spent so much of your life
around fires that smoke no longer affects you the way
it does other creatures. Your vision isn't impaired by
nonmagical smoke, and you gain a +5 trait bonus on
Fortitude saves to avoid coughing and choking because
of smoke inhalation (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 426).
This trait confers no benefits against magically created
smoke, such as that produced by pyrotechnics.
