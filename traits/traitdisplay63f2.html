You always have a great idea for a prank. You gain a +1 trait bonus on dirty trick combat maneuver checks. You also gain a +1 trait bonus to your CMD when an opponent attempts a dirty trick combat maneuver check against you. If you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against a flatfooted opponent, increase the duration of the condition caused by 1 round.
