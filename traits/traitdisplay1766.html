The Thrice-Damned House of Thrune rules Cheliax with autocratic power, and its representatives can be found throughout the empire, drawn from all walks of life. Most of these agents do not work directly as government employees, but they still serve House Thrune in whatever ways they can. You are a true patriot of Cheliax, and have long worked for House Thrune as a paid informant. You report what you see to the authorities, and occasionally carry out specific tasks suited to your skill set and abilities when asked. People like you help prevent potential traitors and other "undesirables" from undermining Thrune's authority and keep Chelish society running smoothly. You hope that with continued faithful service, you will eventually be rewarded with greater authority and autonomy as a sworn agent of House Thrune. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, Disguise checks, and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you.
