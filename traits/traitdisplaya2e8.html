You have often seen lawbreakers
go free when they demonstrate they have friends in high
places, and so you put special effort into befriending
powerful people yourself. Whenever you are in an area
in which you have used the Diplomacy skill to gather
information, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy
and Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +2 when
dealing with government officials.

Suggested Characters: Absalom natives, Aspis Consortium
agents, Taldans.
