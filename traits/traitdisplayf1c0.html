You were exposed to an artifact or other powerful magic that infused you with the power of dragons. Choose the acid, cold, electricity, or fire spell descriptor when you take this trait. Once per day for every 2 caster levels you have (minimum once per day), when you cast a spell that has your chosen elemental descriptor, you can deal an additional 1d4 points of damage of that energy type to one target of that spell.
