Requirement(s) [Elf] Kyonin
You helped maintain the elf gates and are familiar with the operation of teleportation magic. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify teleportation magic and a +1 trait bonus to caster level checks when casting teleportation spells. You know the proper commands to operate a particular elf gate (most likely an often used elf gate, but at the GM's discretion it may be a less popular or out-of-the-way elf gate).
