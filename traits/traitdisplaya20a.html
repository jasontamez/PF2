Category Drawback
Living under constant threat of death or
worse from your oppressive government, your nerves
have frayed terribly. Whenever you take 10 on an ability
check or skill check that imparts any penalty for failure
(aside from wasted time), you treat your check as if you
had rolled an 8 instead of a 10, even if you are able to take
your time.
