Category Campaign
Your family is particularly hearty, and has even passed down tales of a Varisian ancestor who sought to cure (or, some loose-lipped relatives say, create) diseases. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws made to resist diseases. Additionally, you are immune to the diseases Vorel's phage and blood veil. You do not need to be of the Varisian ethnicity to take this campaign trait, but if you're not, your background should explain how you have a Varisian ancestor.
