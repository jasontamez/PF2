Requirement(s) City of Brass
You were born a noble in the City of Brass, but were unjustly stripped of your title or exiled. Now, your ire prevents you from brooking any further insult unto your already disgraced name. Whenever an enemy attempts to feint against you in combat, the DC to do so is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier, or 10 + your Intimidate bonus, whichever is higher.
