Fate smiled on you and Professor Lorrimor one day in the not so distant past. Through a matter of pure chance, you were in a position to save the late scholar's life and did so. His gratitude was effusive, and he promised that he would never forget you. You are unsure of the nature of the summons in his will, but believe he may have listed you as a possible heir in thanks for saving him from an untimely demise.

Your ability to think quickly on your feet has stayed with you, and you quite often feel that you're in the right place at the right time. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.
