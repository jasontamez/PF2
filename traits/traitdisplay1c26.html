You were raised to believe that undead are nothing to fear-they are simply the unliving remnants of your honored ancestors. Once per day, you can surround yourself with an aura of unlife. Unintelligent undead ignore you unless you take action against them, per hide from undead. The protection lasts 1 round for every two character levels you possess (with a minimum of 1 round). If you take any offensive action against any undead, this effect immediately ends. This is a supernatural ability.
