You make it a point to know everyone
and to be connected to everything around you. You
frequent the best taverns, attend all of the right events,
and graciously help anyone who needs it. Because of this,
you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information and Knowledge (local) checks. One of these
skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
