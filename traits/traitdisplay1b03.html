You have grown up near the Cyphergate, passing under its arch countless times in your lifetime. You can recount the runes from memory, and repeated exposure has imbued you with a faint resistance to runic magic. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against spells with the word "glyph" or "symbol" in their name.
