You are skilled at slipping away from crowds. Once per day, you can attempt a Bluff check to create a diversion to hide with a +2 trait bonus on the check, and if successful, you take only a -5 penalty on your Stealth check to get to an unobserved place while observers are distracted (instead of the normal -10 penalty).
