Requirement(s) Undine
You learned early on that teamwork can help keep you safe from troublemakers. Choose one teamwork feat (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 150) that requires an ally with the same feat to be adjacent to you. You may benefit from that teamwork feat as long as you have an ally within 10 feet of you (though your ally does not benefit from the teamwork feat unless it also has this trait or a similar ability).
