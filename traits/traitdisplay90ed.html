Thanks to your medical innovations, you can perform especially comprehensive or speedy surgeries. You begin play with a special healer's kit at no cost and can fully restock your kit by expending materials worth 10 gp and spending 8 hours assembling medical devices. When using this healer's kit to treat deadly wounds, you can either halve the time required to perform the action or add your Intelligence modifier to the number of hit points healed.
