Zealot's Bearing

Category Basic (Faith)
Your fiery passion for your faith or philosophy is obvious to everyone around you. Those who share your convictions automatically find themselves wanting to defer to your zealous authority, making you a natural leader of your faith. Unfortunately, your scorn for those who haven't yet seen the wisdom of converting is equally obvious, and makes you a poor ambassador or missionary to the "ignorant masses" (as you notso- secretly think of them). You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks when dealing with adherents of your faith or philosophy, but a -1 penalty on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks when dealing with anyone else.
