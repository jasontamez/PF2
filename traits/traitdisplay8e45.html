Category Drawback
You have difficulty controlling your temper after living in inhuman conditions in Cheliax, Geb, Irrisen, Katapesh, or Qadira. Whenever a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you must take it unless you succeed at a Will save against a DC equal to 10 + your level. You take a -1 penalty on Will saving throws against spells with the emotion descriptor that do not also have the fear descriptor.
