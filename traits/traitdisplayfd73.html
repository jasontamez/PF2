Your forebears served in an Army of Exploration, and you retain that expansionist spirit. Select a terrain from the ranger's list of favored terrains on page 65 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Once selected, this choice cannot be changed. Once per day while in the selected terrain, you may move across nonmagical difficult terrain as though it were not difficult terrain until the end of your turn.
