Raised by pirates, bandits, or other
troublemakers unwilling to stick out their necks for
you, you are accustomed to operating on your own. The
presence of allies can easily become a distraction to you,
and you do your best to keep them out of your space. You
take a -1 penalty to AC and on attack rolls while adjacent
to allies or when taking the aid another action.
