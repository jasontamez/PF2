Category Basic (Faith)
You were raised under the Prophecies of Kalistrade, and were inspired to seize upon an untapped business opportunity. Up to once per week, when you work to advance this opportunity with at least 1 day of effort, you can attempt an appropriate Profession check to earn money or gain capital using the downtime rules (Ultimate Campaign 76) with a +2 trait bonus. In the event of a failed check, your opportunity is discovered by rivals and you cannot employ this trait for 1 month while you look for a new opportunity.
