You spent your formative years in the town of Ravengro, where your proximity to both a prominent graveyard and an infamous prison left you no stranger to the occasional zombie or skeleton. As such, you developed unique methods of dodging these pests. Once per day, you can cast hide from undead as a spell-like ability. The casting time is a swift action and the caster level for this effect is always 1st; this ability is otherwise identical to the spell.
