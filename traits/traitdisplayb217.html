You're not frightened of the old wives' tales of vampires and ghosts, and though you try to avoid the undead, you've learned how to deal with them. You may cast disrupt undead once per day as a spell-like ability. This is cast at your highest caster level gained; if you have no caster level, it functions at CL 1st.
