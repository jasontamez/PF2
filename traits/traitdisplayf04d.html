Requirement(s) Half-Orc
You were raised by a mix of human and orc family members, or by accommodating half-orc parents, and many people expected you to act as a flawless peacemaker. Whether these hopes saw fruition or met with frustration, you learned a great deal about both cultures. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks involving orcs, half-orcs, and humans, and a +2 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks against members of those races.
