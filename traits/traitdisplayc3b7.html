You can use your natural poison to augment the spells you cast. You can spend a use of your toxic racial trait and use a bit of your toxic saliva or blood as an additional material component for a spell with the poison descriptor (see Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic) to increase the spell's save DC by 1.
