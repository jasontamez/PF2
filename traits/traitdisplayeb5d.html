You were trained in a nowdefunct
philosophical tradition'such as that of the nowdestroyed
Galtan universities or Lirgeni astrologers-and
learned to use logic and reason to persuade others. You can
use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Charisma
modifier on Diplomacy checks to persuade others and on
Bluff checks to convince others that a lie is true. (This trait
does not affect Diplomacy checks to gather information or
Bluff checks to feint in combat.)

Suggested Characters: Arodenites, Galtans, Sodden
Lands natives.
