Growing up amid a large number of
children, you learned quickly how to get others' attention
and keep it. When you modify a character's attitude with
the Diplomacy or Intimidate skill, the attitude change
lasts 1-1/2 times longer than it otherwise would. Whenever
you create a fear or mind-affecting effect that imposes
a penalty or bonus with a duration of at least 2 rounds,
it lasts 1 additional round after it would normally end.
For example, if you demoralize a foe with an Intimidate
check and beat the DC by 5, the victim is shaken for 3
rounds instead of the usual 2 rounds.

Suggested Characters: Free Captains, gnomes, Keleshites.
