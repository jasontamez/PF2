You've grown up in or around Sandpoint and are the heir to your family's modest farm, shop, or fishing boat, but You've always dreamed of more. Searching for a taste of excitement, You've come into town to participate in this year's Swallowtail festival. The thrill of danger grants you an additional +5 feet of movement during the first round of any combat. Additionally, you begin play with three star candle fireworks (see Ultimate Equipment).
