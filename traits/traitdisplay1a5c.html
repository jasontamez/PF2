Category Basic (Combat)
You trained with blades for long hours as a
youth, either taking lessons in the genteel art of fencing
from tutors paid for by your parents or being taken under
the wing of a disenfranchised fencer who may have turned
to a life of crime. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack of
opportunity attack rolls made with daggers, swords, and
similar bladed weapons.
