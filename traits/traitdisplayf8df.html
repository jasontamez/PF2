You are a master of seeing through falsehoods and sharing secrets-the wind itself seems to carry your voice to those you trust. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks to tell when someone is lying to you. Additionally, at will, as long as you are outdoors or in an area where there is noticeable air movement, you can whisper to any creature from up to 30 feet away. You can only designate one person in sight to hear your voice, and nearby creatures can hear these messages with a successful DC 20 Perception check. This is an extraordinary ability that otherwise functions as message.
