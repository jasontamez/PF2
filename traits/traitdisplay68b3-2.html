Once per day, you may voluntarily fail a saving throw against a harmful spell or effect. After using this ability, for the next minute you may add a +4 trait bonus on one saving throw, after which the bonus is expended. You may use this bonus on an additional saving throw against the spell or effect you voluntarily failed (such as a recurring poison save or a follow-up save against hold person). If you do not use this bonus within 1 minute, it is lost.
