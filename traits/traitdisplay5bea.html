Requirement(s) [Elf] Calistria
You have a special connection between you and Calistria that enhances your ability to achieve vengeance. When a creature damages you with a weapon, on your next turn you gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon damage against that creature. If this creature is your ilduliel (see page 8), this bonus increases to +2.
