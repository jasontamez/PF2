You grew up among thieves and
scoundrels, and their unusual speech patterns
and turns of phrase don't faze you in the slightest.
Anyone who attempts to use Bluff to deliver a
secret message to you gains a +5 bonus on her
Bluff check. When you attempt to intercept a secret message using Sense Motive, you gain a +5 trait
bonus on the attempt.
