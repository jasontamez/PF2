Category Campaign
Although out of work, you aren't particularly keen on the prospect of gambling away your last remaining coins simply for a chance at riches. That said, if the Gold Goblin's fortunes reverse after this big gambling tournament, you're relatively certain its owner, Saul Vancaskerkin, will be needing to hire on some new staff members. You've secured payment for the tournament, and intend on attending mostly to check the place out, to decide if it's a place you-d want to work at (as a bouncer, bartender, croupier, server, entertainer, spotter, or cook), and hopefully get a chance to catch Saul's eye and make an impression. You've long worked at honing your skills, and are quite accomplished and certain that you have something to offer. Pick one of the following skills: Bluff, Craft (any), Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform (any), Profession (gambler), or Spot. You gain a +1 trait bonus in that skill, and that skill is always considered a class skill for you.
