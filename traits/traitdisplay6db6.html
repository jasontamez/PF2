You've lived your whole life in the shadow of your older sibling, a person who seems to have the adventure-filled lifestyle You've always wanted for yourself. While your sibling always took care of you, he or she never supported your desire to become an adventurer-your sibling never explained why, only saying, "Adventuring can cause a lot of pain just as easily as it can bring success and riches." As a younger sibling to one of Sandpoint's more inf luential citizens, you share some of that NPC's innate talent and skill at adventuring. If you're Ameiko's younger sibling, your ferocious independence and self-confidence give you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. If you're Sandru's younger sibling, your hearty constitution gives you a +1 trait bonus on all Fortitude saving throws. If you're Shalelu's younger sibling, your quick ref lexes give you a +1 trait bonus on all Ref lex saving throws. Note: Although you're a younger sibling of an established NPC, this doesn't necessarily lock you in to being the same race as that NPC-if you're a different race or ethnicity than the NPC you choose as your older sister or brother, you were adopted into the family by your parents. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your older sibling. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Sandru, Shalelu.
