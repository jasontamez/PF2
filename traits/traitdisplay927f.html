Requirement(s) Kyonin
Only the most cunning scouts of Kyonin are selected to serve as guards along the border between the elven nation and the dreaded Tanglebriar. Most who are sent to patrol those blighted reaches go with the aid of potent magical items and under the cloak of arcane disguise. You are either close with some who have guarded the elven homeland or know of the magical defenses used by the elves against their demonic foes. When you cast an enchantment spell on a chaotic evil outsider, the DC of that spell is increased by 2.
