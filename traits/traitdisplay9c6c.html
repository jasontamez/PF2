Requirement(s) any Great Old One
Whenever you are affected by a transmutation spell of the polymorph subschool, your new form is always in some way horrific, grotesque, or otherwise marked by the corruption of the Great Old Ones. While polymorphed, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Intimidate checks and increase the DC of spells you cast with the fear descriptor by 1. However, you also take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy checks while polymorphed.
