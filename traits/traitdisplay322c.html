Keen Appraiser

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Quests-Campaigns">Quests and Campaigns pg. 19</a>
Category Basic (Magic)
Your frequent handling of magic
items, artifacts, and other enchanted goods has made you
an expert at determining when something has magical
properties. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise checks.
In addition, you need only exceed the DC of an Appraise
check by 2 in order to determine whether the item in question has magic properties (although success still
does not grant knowledge of the magic item's abilities).

Suggested Characters: Drumans, dwarves, Torag worshipers.
