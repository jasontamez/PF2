You are inured to the bright glare of the hot desert sun, and its dazzling rays pose little danger to you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against effects that would cause you to become dazzled or blinded, and once per day when you would be dazzled or blinded by an effect, you can reduce the duration of that effect by half (minimum 1 round). You cannot use this ability if you are already dazzled or blinded or if you have the light sensitivity or light blindness special quality.
