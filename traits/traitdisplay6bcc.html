Requirement(s) Ifrit
You are a pyromaniac by nature and love nothing more than setting fires. As a full-round action, you can produce a small flame at the end of your finger that ignites combustible materials as a tindertwig. Alternatively, you can maintain a flame equivalent to a candle by spending a standard action each round to concentrate on it.
