Your skin is an odd tint that somehow absorbs background colors. Maybe because your mother drank a lot of potions when you were still inside her belly. Maybe because you've been blessed by the barghests. Maybe because you're just better than the other boring goblins. In any case, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Stealth checks, providing you wear only light armor or no armor.
