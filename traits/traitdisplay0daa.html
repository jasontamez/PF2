You demand that everything must happen right now, no matter what, and are too impatient to wait for everyone else to catch up. You finish people's sentences, blurt out the punch lines to slowly-told jokes, rarely make plans, and leap headlong into anything that looks like it might get interesting. While this has sometimes gotten you in trouble, it's also trained you to start moving a split second before everyone else, and that's saved your hide a few times as well. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all Initiative checks.
