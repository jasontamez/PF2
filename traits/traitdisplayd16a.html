You awake in the asylum horribly aware of dangers lurking nearby. While your memories are hazy and indistinct, everything around you looks vibrant and clear. You have an inkling that you have always been perceptive and can tell a lot about a person even in a quick meeting. This sensitivity can overwhelm you at times, especially in your current situation.

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise, Perception, and Sense Motive checks, and one of these (your choice) is a class skill for you. In addition, once per week you can use the <a href="skills18ed.html?ItemName=Appraise">psychometry occult skill unlock</a> even if you are not capable of casting psychic spells or have the <a href="featdisplayfc3c.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Sensitivity">Psychic Sensitivity</a> feat.
