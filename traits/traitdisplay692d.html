You have become so accustomed to binging on the finer things in life that you find going without such excess particularly strenuous. Goods and services cost you 10% more (and can't be paid for by allies), and you need twice as much food and liquid as normal for the purposes of preventing starvation and thirst (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444).
