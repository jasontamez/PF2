Whenever you found yourself involved in a group effort in the past, be it working with siblings to handle a family emergency, conspiring with friends to orchestrate a prank, or throwing in with coworkers to take care of an unanticipated complication at work, you tended to end up in a position of leadership. It might be unclear to you why this is the case, or you might deliberately seek out such positions, knowing you can organize any group to be something greater than the sum of its parts, but your knack for managing groups has always pushed you to the front of any operation you've found yourself a part of.

You excel in the role of manager. You treat your Charisma score as if it were 14 (or 2 points higher than its actual score if your actual Charisma is already 14 or higher) for the purposes of determining how many teams you can manage in the rebellion, and for the purposes of determining the bonus you add to your managed teams' actions. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your Leadership score if you take the Leadership feat.
