Your faith in the empyreal lords-a host of good demigods-and your fascination with the legendary Angel of the Arvensoar have you constantly on the hopeful lookout for celestial messengers. Choose an empyreal lord as your patron deity. You gain Celestial as a bonus language and a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks when dealing with good-aligned humanoids.
