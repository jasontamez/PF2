Category Campaign
Although she is seen as something of a mystery to most of Sandpoint's citizens, Shalelu has never really seemed all that mysterious to you. Of course, that's probably because she helped raise you. You have never quite figured out why Shalelu decided to treat you as a younger sibling, but you certainly appreciated it- and you eagerly absorbed all of the survivalist tricks that she showed you over the years. As a result, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all Survival checks, and Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your mentor. NPC Choices: Shalelu.
