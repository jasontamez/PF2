You gain the ability to don or remove heavy armor in half the normal time. Additionally, you begin play with a great helm bearing the iconography of your family (this helm grants no special defensive benefits). While wearing this helm with a suit of heavy armor, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Intimidate checks.
