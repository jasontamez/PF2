Category Basic (Magic)
You learned the secrets of
transmutation from a follower of the empyreal lord Korada.
Whenever you cast a spell from the transmutation school,
its effects manifest at +1 caster level. Additionally, select one
of the following transmutation spells: bear's endurance, bull's
strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, or owl's wisdom.
Once per day when you cast that spell, its duration is doubled.
A spell affected by this trait cannot be modified further by
the Extend Spell metamagic feat or similar abilities.
