You're not a native Osirian, but the opportunity to explore the tombs of Ancient Osirion-and "liberate" the treasures they hold-is too good to pass up. Whether or not you're interested in the history of this land, you're def initely interested in the wealth that's lain hidden in dusty crypts for millennia- such as the tombs in the newly opened necropolis of Wati. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Appraise checks, and that skill is always a class skill for you. In addition, your contacts in the antiquities markets allow you to sell relics of Ancient Osirion for 60% of their listed price, rather than the normal 50% value. What is considered a relic of Ancient Osirion is left to the GM's discretion.
