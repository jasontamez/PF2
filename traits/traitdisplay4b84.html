Your existence is so meaningless to your chosen patron that it cares nothing for how you wield its power. You may prepare and cast spells whose alignment is in opposition to your patron's, but doing so causes you to take 1 point of Wisdom damage per spell level when the spell is cast. This does not permit you to use spell trigger or completion items of opposing alignments.
