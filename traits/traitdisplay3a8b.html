Your faith in the Wind and the Waves helps you navigate through all manner of mist or haze. You can see normally up to 5 feet away in areas of nonmagical fog, mist, rain, or similar conditions (such as the spray of a waterfall). Your sight is still obscured beyond 5 feet as normal in these conditions.
