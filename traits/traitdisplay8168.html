At some time in the recent past you died, but you were brought back to life-whether because of magic, a blessing of the gods, a destiny you have to fulf ill, or perhaps it just wasn't your time to die yet. Whatever the nature of your resurrection, your experience gave you a fascination with death, and you hope to find some insight into the nature of mortality by exploring the tombs of Wati's famous necropolis. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against death effects. In addition, you do not die until your hit points drop to a negative amount equal to or lower than your Constitution score + 4.
