Whether you are aware of it or not, the moment of your birth was but one part of a far-reaching machination in a dragon's grand design, and the influence of that mysterious plan makes you a little harder to kill. When dying, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Constitution checks to become stable. In addition, you die from hit point loss only once your hit points equal or exceed a negative amount equal to your Constitution score + 2.
