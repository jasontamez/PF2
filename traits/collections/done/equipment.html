You are especially good at disguising yourself when you have props available. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks when wearing a wig, false beard, or similar large prop, or if you are wearing a special costume or eye-catching bauble that reinforces your disguise.

You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community. Once per week, when looking for an item with a price greater than the local community's base value (see page 461 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), make a DC 10 Diplomacy check; add 10 to the DC for each community size category between the current community and the community size with a base value sufficient for that item. Success means (with GM approval) you're able to sell or purchase that item as if the local community were of sufficient size. Each additional attempt (successful or otherwise) in that community increases the DC by an additional +10.

Example: If you're trying to find a +1 cloak of resistance (1,000 gp), you-d normally need to be in a small town (base value 1,000 gp) or larger to be able to find that item with little trouble. If you're currently in a hamlet, that's two community sizes away from a small town, so the Diplomacy DC is 30. If you went to a village and asked there, the DC would only be 20 because it's only one community size away from a small town.

You really know how to make a good impression when you're dressed well. Whenever you are wearing clothing and/or jewelry worth at least 150 gp (and not otherwise covered in gore, sewage, or other things that mar your overall look), you gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks. One of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you.

You carry a non-masterwork simple or martial weapon that has been passed down from generation to generation in your family (pay the standard gp cost for the weapon). When you select this trait, choose one of the following benefits: proficiency with that specific weapon, a +1 trait bonus on attacks of opportunity with that specific weapon, or a +2 trait bonus on one kind of combat maneuver when using that specific weapon.

You have an uncanny knack for turning equipment to new and unexpected uses. When using an item for anything other than its intended purpose'such as using a crowbar as a grappling hook or an old shirt to bandage a deadly wound-reduce the improvisation penalty by 2. This does not apply to improvised weapon penalties. Your GM may rule that some things are just not suitable for use in certain ways; for example, gluing a dead orc's face to your own face won't help you disguise yourself as an orc.

People trust your words over their own eyes. You may make a Bluff check to make observers believe that an object in your possession is actually a different object entirely. The DC for the check is 20 for items of a similar size, shape, and color (such as a glaive and a quarterstaff). Items of a different shape, size, or color raise the DC by 5 for each dissimilar aspect, or more if the dissimilarity is extreme. This deception lasts 1 minute; if the item is still in view, the observers may recognize their error unless you make another bluff check.

In your hand a whip has a life of its own, wrapping around pillars and beams with ease. You can use a whip as if it were a rope with a grappling hook at the end. Attaching your whip is a standard action, but detaching it is a full-round action.

You're skilled at learning the feel of a particular weapon after a few swings in combat. After your first attack with a weapon in which you are not proficient, the non-proficiency penalty decreases by 2 (to a -2 penalty). This effect lasts only while you have the weapon in hand; you must "relearn" the weapon each time you pick it up.

Your intense familiarity with the tools of your trade allows you to use them in combat as if they were actual weapons and makes them more effective for that purpose than they would normally be. When you use a tool of your trade (requiring at least 1 rank in the appropriate Craft or Profession skill) as a weapon, you do not take the improvised weapon penalty and instead receive a +1 trait bonus on your attack. This trait is commonly used with shovels, picks, blacksmith hammers, and other sturdy tools-lutes and brooms make terribly fragile weapons.

You have put in many hours practicing with flashy alchemical items that enhance your Perform skill. When you use an attention-getting alchemical item such as a flask of alchemist's fire, smokestick, thunderstone, or another appropriate alchemical item (GM's discretion) as part of a performance, you gain a +2 trait bonus on your Perform check for the duration of that performance. The item is expended without its normal effects and only serves to make your performance more impressive; for example, you could pretend to ignite yourself with alchemist's fire as part of a Perform (comedy) check or make a dramatic appearance with a smokestick as part of a Perform (act) check, but you would not actually take fire damage or gain concealment from smoke.

You are adept at escaping from confinement in an unobtrusive manner. When trying to escape manacles, rope, or other similar restraints (but not grapples or similar attacks), you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of your Escape Artist modifier. If you free yourself, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to pretend that you are still bound.

You can modify old clothing to make it effective in new circumstances. With a basic sewing kit or disguise kit, you can make a Disguise check to change one outfit into another outfit (see page 159 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, or page 13 of this book). The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the gp difference between costs of the outfits. The alteration takes 10 minutes per 1-gp difference in the cost of the outfits.

You always knew that one day you would leave your humble beginnings behind and become an adventurer, so you scrimped and saved, buying the necessary equipment one piece at a time until you had everything you needed. Select one of the equipment packages below. If you select this trait during character creation, you do not receive any starting gold.

Arcane Adept Package

The arcane adept has collected useful magical gear to ensure her success on her adventures, and she prides herself on having just the right tool for the job. This equipment package is appropriate for an arcanist, sorcerer, witch, or wizard. Some bards and summoners might also find it attractive.

Blessed Warden Package

A blessed warden is prepared to protect herself against the horrors of evil-aligned planes. This equipment package is suitable for clerics, druids, inquisitors, oracles, and paladins. The specific gear is appropriate for those visiting the chaotic evil Abyss but can be adjusted to suit other evilaligned planes, such as swapping the scrolls of protection from chaos for scrolls of protection from law for a package designed for travel to Hell.
Armor: Masterwork chain shirt.
Weapons: Cold iron shortspear, light crossbow with 20 crossbow bolts.
Combat Gear: Holy water (3), <a href="spelldisplaye3d6.html?ItemName=cure%20light%20wounds">scrolls of cure light wounds</a> (2), <a href="spelldisplay1545.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20chaos">scrolls of protection from chaos</a> (2), <a href="spelldisplay435e.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20evil">scrolls of protection from evil</a> (2), <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">scroll of remove curse</a>.

Corporeal Warrior Package

Normal equipment is ill suited to fighting intangible foes, and a warrior bound for the Ethereal Plane must be prepared for incorporeal threats lurking in the ever-present mists. This equipment package is suitable for fighters and paladins. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.
Armor: Masterwork breastplate.
Weapons: Heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, heavy mace, masterwork longsword.
Combat Gear: Alchemist's fire, <a href="spelldisplay8272.html?ItemName=mage%20armor">potion of mage armor</a>, <a href="spelldisplay01c1.html?ItemName=shield">potion of shield</a>, <a href="spelldisplayedfd.html?ItemName=magic%20weapon">oil of magic weapon</a>.

Total Weight: 87 lbs. (48-1/2 lbs. for a Small character).

Daring Bravo Package

The daring bravo is equally adept in social situations and combat, with the right equipment to move fluidly from one to the other. Such adventurers are known as much for their flair and panache as their martial prowess, and the daring bravo's equipment is often ornately ornamented or personalized. This equipment package is good for a bard, fighter, rogue, swashbuckler, or vigilante. Certain cavaliers, investigators, skalds, or even paladins may also find it appealing. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.
Armor: Masterwork chain shirt.
Weapons: Light crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork rapier, sap, alchemical silver dagger.

Total Weight: 76-1/2 lbs. (40-1/2 lbs. for a Small character).

Holy Warrior Package

The holy warrior is prepared to use her might and zeal to take the fight to the enemy, but she understands the importance of having the right equipment to overcome the resistances of her monstrous foes. This equipment package is well-suited to a cleric, inquisitor, paladin, warpriest, or even a fighter with a religious background. It's especially suited to characters who focus on supporting their party members and making them more effective in a fight. Even more than with other equipment packages, the GM should consider substituting the masterwork longsword in this package with a masterwork melee weapon appropriate to the PC's faith. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.
Armor: Heavy steel shield, masterwork breastplate.
Weapons: Cold iron morningstar, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork longsword.

Total Weight: 102 lbs. (57-1/4 lbs. for a Small character).

Lore Seeker Package

The lore seeker has the equipment necessary to delve into ancient ruins searching for lost knowledge. As this equipment package contains little by way of armor or weapons, it is most appropriate for alchemists, bards, monks, sorcerers, and wizards. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch and a holy symbol (if required).
Weapons: Light crossbow with 10 bolts, quarterstaff, silver dagger.
Combat Gear: Alchemist's fire (3), antitoxin, <a href="spelldisplay505d-2.html?ItemName=erase">oil of erase</a>, <a href="spelldisplaye3d6.html?ItemName=cure%20light%20wounds">potions of cure light wounds</a> (2), <a href="spelldisplay435e.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20evil">potion of protection from evil</a>, tanglefoot bag, thunderstone.

Armor: Leather armor, light wooden shield.
Weapons: Shortspear, sling with 10 bullets.
Combat Gear: Antitoxin, bead of blessing (as a <a href="magicwondrousdisplayfc41.html?FinalName=Strand%20of%20Prayer%20BeadsLesser">lesser strand of prayer beads</a> without the bead of healing), holy water (2), <a href="spelldisplaye3d6.html?ItemName=cure%20light%20wounds">scrolls of cure light wounds</a> (2), <a href="spelldisplay2b11.html?ItemName=endure%20elements">scroll of endure elements</a>.

Total Weight: 67 lbs. (39-1/4 lbs. for a Small character).

Planar Traveler Package

This package equipment prepares planar travelers for the challenges of a variety of planar destinations. This package works particularly well for lightly armored combatants, such as bards and rogues. If the PC purchasing it can cast spells, add a spell component pouch as well.
Armor: Masterwork studded leather, light wooden shield.
Weapons: Composite longbow with 20 arrows, masterwork morningstar.

Questing Knight Package

If not descended from nobility, the questing knight certainly looks like he fits the part. This equipment package is useful for cavaliers, fighters, and paladins. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch and a holy symbol (if required). If the PC gains a mount from a class feature, remove the horse from the list below and replace the lance with a masterwork lance.
Armor: Half-plate, heavy wooden shield.
Weapons: Javelins (4), lance, longsword.
Combat Gear: Sunrods (2).

Wilderness Wanderer Package

This equipment package is appropriate for any lightly-armored combatant in the wild, such as a barbarian, hunter, or ranger. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch and holly and mistletoe. The GM might consider altering which weapon is masterwork, based on the PC's specialization. For example, an archery-focused ranger might prefer a masterwork composite longbow over a masterwork greataxe.
Armor: Light wooden quickdraw shield, masterwork studded leather armor.
Weapons: Cold iron flail, composite longbow with 20 arrows, masterwork greataxe, short sword.
