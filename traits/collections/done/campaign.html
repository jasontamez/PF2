Lore Seeker: The secrets of an ancient fallen civilization intrigue you, particularly the magical traditions of its highly mystical culture. You've studied magic intensely, and hope to increase that knowledge by adding ancient lore.

Exile: For whatever reason, you were forced to flee your homeland. Chance or fate has brought you to twon, and it's here that your money ran out, leaving you stranded in this small town. You are also being pursued by enemies from your homeland, and that has made you paranoid and quick to react to danger. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks.

Missionary: You have come to town to see about expanding the presence of your chosen faith after receiving visions that told you your faith is needed in the region-what that need is, though, you're not quite sure.

Westcrown has long suffered under a peculiar curse, a blight that rises every night, bringing with it fell beasts that hunt the shadows. No one can say from whence these night-horrors come-though some blame the mysterious wizards of Nidal, other claim that it's some curse laid by fallen Aroden, while still others suggest some shadowy mastermind manipulates an ebon brood from the depths of Westcrown's northern ruins. Whatever the case, the people of Westcrown have long feared the night, but not you. You're goal is to reclaim the darkness from the beasts that hide within.

Your reasons for turning to a life of crime may be varied, but what matters is that you eventually fell in with a certain well-connected and notorious crime lord named Gaedren Lamm. His reputation as a snake and a treacherous scoundrel was known to you, but for reasons of your own, you chose not to turn him down when he offered you a chance to work for him.

As it worked out, though, Gaedren got the upper hand and took you down you first.

Whatever the cause, Gaedren wronged you, and you are eager for the chance to get revenge.

Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your orphanage traded you to him in return for a desperately needed financial loan. Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren's slaves, were merely a child of the street who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he said would be "a little light work." Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of "Lamm's Lambs" before escaping. You've nursed a grudge against the old man ever since.

Choose one of the following benefits.

Religious: Today, while on a job for Gaedren, you found a holy symbol of the god you worship, and intrigued by it, you snuck off to attend services. When Gaedren found out, he beat you to within an inch of your life and broke your holy symbol. Your faith let you block out the pain, and you escaped his control and took shelter in the church, where you spent the rest of your youth. You gain a +2 trait bonus on concentration checks and Constitution checks to stabilize at negative hit points.

Torturedv: After you made one too many errors, Gaedren tortured you and left you for dead in a garbage heap. Your scars and memories have motivated you to hone your reaction speed and make you rather jumpy. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves.

Exactly how much knowledge you possess is left to the GM's discretion.

You've always hated dragons. Perhaps one of your ancestors was a well-known dragonslayer, or a rampaging dragon killed your family or friends. Maybe the stories you grew up hearing about knights rescuing captive princes and princesses from the clutches of evil dragons inspired you to slay dragons. Whatever the reason for your obsession, it has driven you to study how to fight dragons and defend yourself against their fearsome attacks.

Your family has always been dogged by rumors that a bit of giant blood got into the family's veins at some point. Whether this was through alchemical or magical experimentation, or because your great-great-grandfather married a giant, it has made you big for your race, and may have given you other minor cosmetic features of giants, such as flaming red hair, a bluish tinge to your skin, or oversized hands. When you wield a weapon that is larger than your size, the penalty on attack rolls for using inappropriately sized weapons is reduced by half. In addition, you gain a +2 trait bonus to your CMD against awesome blow combat maneuvers. If you're a dwarf, your stability racial trait applies to awesome blow combat maneuvers as well.

You take no penalty on Intimidate checks against creatures with the giant subtype that are larger than you, and you gain a +1 trait bonus to the DC of any fear-based effect you use against a creature with the giant subtype.

You've trained with some of the best giantslayers out there, and have learned how to avoid the worst effects of a giant's powerful attacks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves. In addition, once per day, when a creature with the giant subtype successfully confirms a critical hit against you with a weapon or a slam attack (not a spell or special ability), you can roll with the attack. You take normal damage from the blow, as if the critical had not been confirmed. You must be aware of the attack and able to react to it-if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC, you can't use this ability. If you are a dwarf or a gnome, you can use this ability twice per day.

Requirement(s) Giantslayer
You were born and raised in the town of Trunau, one of the few human settlements in the orc-dominated Hold of Belkzen. Orc attacks are an ever-present threat, and like all Trunauans, you have made the Standing Vow: to hold Trunau against all attackers, orc or otherwise, to stand your ground, and to live free or die trying. Upon coming of age, you were given a hopeknife-a small, sheathed dagger, usually worn on a chain under your clothes-and taught how to use it to take your own life to avoid capture by orcs, or to grant the mercy of a quick death to the wounded. As a native, you have served in Trunau's militia, and fought alongside Patrol Captains Kurst and Rodrik Grath. You begin play with a hopeknife (a masterwork dagger), and your tenacity in the face of adversity grants you a +1 trait bonus on Will saves.

Requirement(s) Hell's Rebels
You had the fortune (or perhaps the misfortune, depending on your viewpoint) to be born into one of Kintargo's noble families. Your experience growing up among the city's well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the new situation in Kintargo brewing, there is much concern about an eventual restructuring of the city's nobility. Already, one noble estate has burned to the ground under what can best be described as suspicious circumstances, but whether the government or rebels were responsible depends on whom you ask. With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in the Greens. If you want to be a member of one of Kintargo's major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level.

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is always a class skill for you. The Noble Scion feat (see the sidebar on page 11) does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. In addition, you start play with a noble's outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. If you take the Noble Scion feat, your last name is probably Aulamaxa, Aulorian, Delronge, Jarvis, Jhaltero, Sarini, Tanessen, or Vashnarstill; if you're not human, you were adopted into the family. If you don't take this feat, you can make up your last name.

Requirement(s) Hell's Rebels
The opera is perhaps the most important and prestigious form of entertainment offered in Kintargo, and the Kintargo Opera House is among the most famous of its kind. You're hardly a superstar among the performers who-ve graced the stage there, but you have performed several times before in small parts. Just recently, you got your big break-you-d won a role in the infamous opera Huntress of Heroes, and had been studying for the role furiously before the onset of martial law dashed your plans to the dirt. Now that the Kintargo Opera House has been claimed by Barzillai Thrune, all shows have been canceled and your chance at success seems to have been lost. Yet you can't lose hope. You still practice your skills, and some day, perhaps the Kintargo Opera House will open its doors again, at which point you intend to be center stage!

Choose one type of Perform skill. You gain a +1 trait bonus in that specific Perform skill, and all Perform skills are class skills for you. You also increase the save DCs of all language-dependent spells and effects you create by 1.

Requirement(s) Hell's Rebels
You, or perhaps your family, were once worshipers of Asmodeus, but something happened that made you lose your faith. Perhaps your family was asked to give up something dear as a sacrifice, such as the life of a newly born brother or sister. Maybe the church used your family as a scapegoat to cover up a crime someone higher in the church committed. Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth-that Asmodeus does not care for his followers, and that the deity of your new religion does. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was punished; they were either put in prison, exiled from Kintargo, or perhaps even executed. Ever since, you've vowed to some day get revenge against the church.

Choose one: you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls or you gain a +1 trait bonus on the save DCs of your spells against agents of House Thrune and worshipers of Asmodeus, including most (but not all) devils.

Fed-Up Citizen [<a href="traitdisplayaca9.html">Link</a>]

Requirement(s) Hell's Rebels
Kintargo is a tough place to live if you count yourself as a law-abiding citizen. While you likely agree with most others of Kintargo that many of the laws put in place by House Thrune seem excessive, you always respected the law and honored it as best you could. You likely worship a deity such as Abadar or Iomedae -a lawful neutral or perhaps lawful good power allowed to practice within Cheliax, but only under restrictions. Yet despite this, Thrune has always made Cheliax a safer place to live. But with recent events, enough is enough. As much as it pains you to admit, the law of the land is now manifestly and obviously not correct, and something must be done to oppose this misuse of power. If that means aligning yourself to a rebel faction such as the Silver Ravens, so be it.

Note that this trait works particularly well for paladins or other characters who wish to venerate lawful causes but still oppose the government. Your GM should be open to allowing lawful characters to perform actions out of character for someone of lawful alignment, provided the end goal is a new and better government for Kintargo, but with this feat, characters tied strongly to law (such as lawful clerics, monks, or paladins) can hide those ties in ways that help them perform as rebels without giving up their actual convictions.

You're good at hiding your true colors and faith to avoid attracting the wrong kind of attention. You gain a +1 bonus on Disguise checks, and Disguise is always a class skill for you. In addition, when someone uses detect good or detect law on you, your effective Hit Dice are 4 lower than their actual total when someone discerns the strength of your aura. If you are a cleric, paladin, or similar divine spellcaster, you treat yourself as if you were a standard-aligned creature rather than a divine spellcaster for these purposes. This means that until you become 9th level, you won't radiate an aura of good or law at all when someone casts one of these detection spells. Finally, your internal convictions that you're on the actual right of law help bolster your mindset, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

You grew up among Kintargo's performers and entertainers. Perhaps your parents or older siblings were singers at the Kintargo Opera House, or maybe you simply had to make ends meet as an orphan of the streets by busking. Whatever the case, you've long been exposed to the practice of cloaking scathing political commentaries in the form of harmless entertainment. Whether you conceal your satire in the form of novels, plays, screeds, or public letters, you've yet to make a name for yourself as a political presence in Kintargo-but in time, you hope to change that!

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Linguistics checks, and Linguistics is always a class skill for you. In addition, your irreverent attitude grants you a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against fear effects.

You've long been interested in the legacy of the Silver Ravens-a group of freedom fighters that rose to prominence in Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War. There's frustratingly little information today about the group, and you suspect that most of what was recorded about the Silver Ravens has long since been redacted or destroyed by government agents, but You've managed to pick up a tidbit here and there. Most of your knowledge isn't so much about the Silver Ravens specifically, but more about general histories of rebel groups and freedom fighters who have fought against oppressive governments throughout history, both in Cheliax and beyond.

Your familiarity with rebel groups allows you to grant a +2 bonus on an Organization check of your choice once the party reestablishes the Silver Ravens during the first adventure. You can change which check you assign this bonus to once at the start of the rebellion's Upkeep phase. Your time preparing for joining the Silver Ravens has also honed your skill at remaining unseen. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks, and Stealth is always a class skill for you.

Requirement(s) Hell's Rebels
Whenever you found yourself involved in a group effort in the past, be it working with siblings to handle a family emergency, conspiring with friends to orchestrate a prank, or throwing in with coworkers to take care of an unanticipated complication at work, you tended to end up in a position of leadership. It might be unclear to you why this is the case, or you might deliberately seek out such positions, knowing you can organize any group to be something greater than the sum of its parts, but your knack for managing groups has always pushed you to the front of any operation you've found yourself a part of.

You excel in the role of manager. You treat your Charisma score as if it were 14 (or 2 points higher than its actual score if your actual Charisma is already 14 or higher) for the purposes of determining how many teams you can manage in the rebellion, and for the purposes of determining the bonus you add to your managed teams' actions. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your Leadership score if you take the Leadership feat.

Requirement(s) Hell's Rebels
There are patterns in the world, both natural and artificial, that if only one can interpret them correctly, great secrets could be divined. You have long been fascinated by the idea of these hidden patterns, perhaps because a sibling or parent went to the grave obsessed with seeking a pattern, or maybe because you feel that you've uncovered a previously unknown pattern. Kintargo has a particularly unique pattern of its own; the belfry atop the Temple of Asmodeus rings at what seem to be random intervals. None know who or what rings the bells, and no true pattern by which the so-called Devil's Bells has yet accurately predicted the tolling. Many have tried, and extensive but always incomplete documents exist that track the dates and times of recorded ringings back to the end of the Chelish Civil War, when the church of Asmodeus first claimed the abandoned temple of Aroden as their own. Maybe you will be the one to solve the pattern of the Devil's Bells?

You gain a +1 trait bonus on all Perception checks, and Perception is always a class skill for you. In addition, you increase the save DC of any illusion (pattern) spell you cast by 1, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against illusion effects.

Growing up in Kintargo, it's hard not to become obsessed with one of the city's celebrities. There are so many to choose from, and they're all so glamorous, rich, and successful! Wouldn't it be amazing to, perhaps some day, meet one of them? Or even better, to be a Kintargan celebrity yourself? Your interest in one of Kintargo's celebrities could be completely benign, with the NPC acting as a muse, inspiration, or role model for you that you used to guide many life choices leading you to this day. Or perhaps your interest is more akin to an obsession, in which you hope to some day live a life like that you imagine your idol lives, or perhaps even to some day meet and become friends (or perhaps more than friends) with your idol. Keep in mind, though, that sometimes a celebrity's public persona and real personality are two very different things, and if some day you were to meet your idol, you might be surprised at the truth! That said, the fact that, by all accounts, your idol has been missing since House Thrune instituted martial law has you worried; you hope he or she is all right! The fact that all five of the local legends listed below have been rumored to have ties to the Silver Ravens further concerns you, considering how that group seems to have been particularly targeted by Barzillai Thrune's agents over the past week. The fate of all five of these Kintargan icons will be revealed at some point during the Hell's Rebels Adventure Path, but keep in mind that some of those fates might not be pleasant discoveries for you!

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. Pick one of the following celebrities with which to be obsessed. Each celebrity is associated with a particular ability score. Once per day, you can draw on your inspiration from your icon when you are about to attempt a skill check modified by that ability score. When you do so, roll the check twice and take the better of the two results as your actual result.

Jackdaw (sex and race unknown; Intelligence): A notorious folk hero or heroine (no one seems to know if Jackdaw is a man or woman) who helped defend Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, and whom many believe still lives on today in the city's shadows.

Jilia Bainilus (female human; Wisdom): Kintargo's previous lord-mayor was well known for her cutting insights into the political world. Few have fought harder to maintain Kintargo's independence.

Octavio Sabinus (male human; Strength): The Lictor of the Hellknight Order of the Torrent might seem an odd choice for admiration, but Octavio's physical stature certainly lent him all the support he needed to command a room.

Shensen (female half-elf; Charisma): Shensen's performances as an outspoken force against the diabolism of House Thrune have won her nearly as many admirers as have her memorable performances on stage in the Kintargo Opera House.

Strea Vestori (female tiefling; Dexterity): Strea is often regarded as the face of the slums known as the Devil's Nursery. As Kintargo's most outspoken and public tiefling citizen and leader of the Cloven Hoof Society, she has nearly as many admirers as she has political enemies in Cheliax.

Much of Kintargo's history is lost or hidden. You know because you've made a point of seeking out those secrets. Local urban legends and bits of strange historical rumors have long fascinated you-who knows what amazing truths about Kintargo's past have been lost forever to the redactors of House Thrune? What caused Professor Mangvhune of the Alabaster Academy to become the city's most infamous serial killer? Who were the dragons Adrakash, Ithanothaur, and Rivozair, and what were their ties to Kintargo? Why do the Devil's Bells of the Temple of Asmodeus seem to ring at random times, and is there a pattern to the peals? Who were the Silver Ravens who defended Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, and why did they vanish so soon after that war's resolution? So many mysteries, and who better than you to find the answers?

Pick one of the questions above as your focus. Answers to these questions can be discovered at different points during Hell's Rebels, but don't expect to learn these answers any time soon! More important, your choice of focus grants you a +1 trait bonus in a particular Knowledge skill check associated with that focus (pick one of the two options provided below for your question). That Knowledge skill is always a class skill for you. Once per day, when you attempt a Knowledge skill check in either of the types associated with your focus, you can roll twice and take the better result as your actual result.

Devil's Bells: Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (planes).
Local Dragons: Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history).
Professor Mangvhune: Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (planes).
Silver Ravens: Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (history).

You have always looked after yourself first, and done whatever you need to do to survive. You've killed before, and you'll kill again, but you don't lose sleep over it. If it's you or them, you invariably choose yourself. You follow no code, unless it's doing whatever brings you to the top. Of course, sometimes you have to work with others, and that's fine too, as long as the pay is right-whatever it takes to get the job done. With the current unrest in Cheliax, it's starting to look like a good deal to work with House Thrune.

In addition, as an immediate action once per day, you can shift your effective alignment so that you are considered neutral instead of evil for the purpose of good effects that target evil creatures (such as <a href="spelldisplayd12e.html?ItemName=holy%20smite">holy smite</a> or a <a href="classdisplay3035.html?ItemName=Paladin">paladin's smite evil</a> ability).

Eventually, however, you decided you wanted more for yourself than a life of study and service, and when you felt you had learned all that you were likely to from your master, you struck out on your own. You know you can achieve the loftiest heights of power with the support of Hell behind you, just as you are aware you can fall to the lowest depths if you're incautious and lose that support. You are determined to use your skills and abilities to bind Hell and its minions to your will, and to make a name for yourself as one of Cheliax's premier devilbinders.

When you cast a <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a> spell to summon a devil or fiendish creature, the duration of that spell increases by 1 round. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on opposed Charisma checks against devils conjured with <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a> spells, and payments to devils you conjure with <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a> spells are reduced by 10%.

Requirement(s) Hell's Vengeance
You had the fortune to be born into one of Cheliax's noble families, and even more importantly, your family is one of those loyal to House Thrune. Perhaps your family has been allied with Thrune since the Chelish Civil War, or maybe Thrune granted your family its title in exchange for its support during that conflict. In any case, your experience growing up among the nation's well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the nascent uprising of the Glorious Reclamation in Cheliax, there is much concern among the aristocracy, and House Thrune needs the support of loyal nobles now more then ever.

This trait assumes you belong to a minor noble human family with a small manor or estate in some backwater of the empire. If you're not human, either you were adopted into a noble human family, or your family was recently granted a nonhereditary noble title (see the Chelish Nobility sidebar on page 15).

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Charismabased checks against other members of the Chelish aristocracy. The <a href="featdisplay8748.html?ItemName=Noble%20Scion">Noble Scion</a> feat does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. Lastly, you start play with a noble's outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp.

Requirement(s) Hell's Vengeance
Some people follow codes and traditions; others look out for only themselves. You don't care-you do what you want, when you want, sometimes for a good reason, and sometimes for no reason at all. You revel in your status as an outlier, and take pride in the fact that you follow no one else's orders-at least most of the time. In a lawful land like Cheliax, one has to be more careful and at least pay lip service to the rules and restrictions of society. As a result, you try to manage the chaos that rages within your soul, but you're always on the lookout for the opportunity to truly unleash destruction. These days, there's plenty of work for someone who will do what needs to be done, no questions asked, and the rewards from House Thrune for those who work with it are a strong incentive as well. If working with others gives you the freedom to carry out some of your darkest instincts without fear of repercussion, then why not-at least for now. You can worry about the future when it comes.

Your unpredictability and volatile temperament gives you an advantage over your foes. You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks. In addition, you are willing to work with others, and have learned to use your allies' strengths to reinforce your own skills and abilities. Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet of you, you can reroll a single attack roll or skill check before success or failure is known. You must take the results of the second roll, even if it is worse. You must be chaotic evil to take this trait.

You, or perhaps your family, were once worshipers of <a href="deitydisplay813c.html?ItemName=Iomedae">Iomedae</a>, but something happened that made you lose your faith. Perhaps your family was accused of being dishonorable or cowardly, or maybe one of your family members was the victim of church "justice." Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth-that the Inheritor's so-called honor, valor, and justice are just tin plating on a strict dogma that seeks to control people by restricting their free will. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was subjected to scorn and holier-than-thou disapproval. Ever since, you've vowed to some day get revenge against the church of Iomedae-and with the current situation brewing in Cheliax, you might finally have the opportunity.

Choose one: against followers of Iomedae, including many (but not all) archons and angels, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, or you gain a +1 trait bonus on the save DCs of your spells.

Halflings are a common sight in Cheliax and make up the majority of that nation's slave population. Known derisively as "slips," halflings are almost universally treated with scorn and contempt, while paradoxically valued as the most precious slaves. You are a Chelish halfling, but unlike most of your race, you have embraced your role in Chelish society, and used it to your own advantage. People constantly overlook you or discount you as an inconsequential slip, but you know the truth-halflings are just as vital to the empire's health as its nobles, priests, and warriors. You may have been born a free halfling who has never known the chains of slavery, or a slave who was later freed after a period of loyal servitude. Or perhaps you are still a slave, happy (or at least content) in your enslavement, and hoping for some eventual recognition of your contribution, however small, to Cheliax's great and orderly society.

You are skilled at prevaricating and dissembling, both to deflect blame away from yourself and to mislead others as to your true abilities and role. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff checks, and Bluff is a class skill for you. In addition, your tacit support of Cheliax's social structure, and the clear knowledge of your own place in society, strengthens your resolve. Once per day, when you are adjacent to a human ally of Chelish descent, you can reroll a Will saving throw before success or failure is known. You must take the results of the second roll, even if it is worse. You must be a halfling to take this trait.

You were born and raised in the town of Longacre on the southwestern fringes of the Whisperwood, or at least have lived there long enough that you're considered a native. You've never been one for the quiet life, and have been considered a miscreant and reprobate since you were a child. As an adult, You've made something of a name for yourself as a thug, enforcer, and petty thief in town, hiring yourself out to anybody who needs muscle in exchange for a few coins. In the course of such employment, You've worked with another local troublemaker named Cimri Staelish and have become friends. Cimri has recently gotten involved with some shadowy, though powerful, characters, and as Hell's Vengeance begins, you and a group of other ne-erdo- wells have agreed to help Cimri burgle a tannery just outside town.

While the worship of <a href="deitydisplay86e0.html?ItemName=Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> is widespread throughout Cheliax, you follow a different path: that of the philosophy of diabolism. Asmodeus and the other archdevils are worthy of respect and emulation, certainly, but rather than worship one Lord of Hell above all others, your faith is instead based on the veneration of the order and laws of Hell itself as a model for a perfect society. Free will must be suppressed to prevent rebellion, slavery is required to keep the unworthy in their place, and evil and cruelty are necessary for good and kindness to exist.

You have sworn your body to Queen Abrogail and House Thrune in a ritual ceremony, and are willing to lay down your life in service to Thrune.

Requirement(s) Iron Gods
Although the Black Sovereign rules Numeria in name, it's the spellcasters of the Technic League who hold the real power. While their inf luence is certainly strongest in the capital of Starfall, their touch can be felt even here in Torch-the League takes a significant cut of the town's income as tithes every month. For some reason, you have a grudge against the Technic League. Perhaps your parents lost their jobs as the result of an act they took that displeased the League-you might even suspect the League was responsible for their deaths. Alternatively, you could just rankle at the League's open acceptance of slavery, their reputation for sadism and cruelty, or their penchant for hoarding and controlling technological wonders. Talk to your GM to refine the reasons why you hate the Technic League, but you're convinced that they are somehow responsible for putting out the town's torch and that evidence of their tampering can be found in the caverns below-if you can find evidence of the Technic League working against Torch's better interests, that could well be a step toward the town's independence from the League. Choose either weapons or spells. If you choose weapons, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all damage rolls made against targets you know are associated with the Technic League. If you choose spells, increase the save DC of your spells by 1 when you target such a foe.

Requirement(s) Iron Gods
You have ties to a prominent local in the town of Torch-the missing wizard Khonnir Baine. If you're a wizard, alchemist, or other scholarly type, he may have been your tutor or teacher. If you're of a more martial bent, Khonnir could instead have been a friend or business associate of your mother, father, or patron. He may even have been your adoptive father, in which case you likely have a bond of friendship or rivalry with his adopted daughter Val (your GM has more information on her in this case if you wish to know more for your character's background). Your association with Khonnir has given you insight into how technology works. Choose Disable Device or Knowledge (engineering). You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks with this skill, and it is a class skill for you. In addition, you are treated as if you possessed the Technologist feat for the purposes of resolving checks associated with that skill.

Numeria is a land ripe for archaeological exploration, since so many of the strange technological dungeons have been either avoided by the superstitious barbarian tribes or have been locked down by the Technic League, leaving many of them untouched and ripe for exploration. You've studied the strange language associated with these eerie technological ruins, and are eager to start exploring them-you suspect that Torch's namesake is in fact part of a larger buried ruin, and you hope to enter these ruins and learn their original purpose by exploring the caves below town. You gain Androffan as an additional language. In addition, you possess a knack for technological items; when you use a timeworn technological item, roll twice when determining any glitches the item might cause and choose which result to use as your actual result.

The fires atop Torch Hill have long been a boon to smiths and metalworkers, and your family is no exception. Whether you grew up in Torch or simply made several trips here with your parents to use the fire, this was to be your first time to use the torch for your own project. You managed to use the fires to craft a small weapon or piece of armor from skymetal, but not long thereafter the fires went out. The violet flames are as much a part of your upbringing as anything else, and their loss distresses you; you hope to find a way to rekindle the torch below the hill. You've long hoped to work with skymetal, and begin the game with a small metal bauble made of the skymetal of your choice-you made this item yourself. The item is nothing more than a valuable art object worth 100 gp. You can sell it to gain an additional 100 gp when creating your character, but if you keep it, your pride in its crafting grants you a +2 trait bonus on Will saving throws made against emotion and fear effects. You lose this bonus if you willingly sell or give up the item, but if it is destroyed or lost through no fault of your own, you retain a +1 trait bonus on such Will saves.

You recently hired on to Sandru's caravan to serve as a guard, but the job, while it paid well, gave you little chance to scratch the adventuring itch, since the caravan never really ventured into dangerous territory. You understand why Sandru avoided the more dangerous routes, of course, but that didn't help assuage your urge to seek adventure.

You've never had the guts to act on it, but for as long as you can remember, You've had a crush on one of the NPCs. Someday, maybe you'll be able to earn the NPC's love, but for now, you're content to spend time in the NPC's proximity, or even to do things for the NPC that might earn you a word of thanks or a smile.

Unless your GM says otherwise, all three of these NPCs are considered to be bisexual as far as this trait's implications are concerned. Note that if you take this trait, you'll likely want to coordinate NPC choices with any other player who chooses this trait as well, since choosing the same NPC could cause unwanted party strife. Of course- if that's what you and the other player are looking for, go for it! In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your crush.

Your family has been close friends with the Mvashtis for as long as you've been alive. Old Niska Mvashti's recent death wasn't all that unexpected- she must have been over a hundred years old, as far as you know-but it was a sobering moment nonetheless. What no one else in your family knows, though, is that in the weeks before her death, Niska must have known that her days were numbered, because she called you to her house one day and made you make a promise: If her daughter Koya ever went on a long trip, you would go with her to ensure her safety. Although the chances of Koya going on a long trip seem remote (she must be at least 60 years old, after all), you've made a promise to Niska to accompany her daughter if such an event comes to pass. Ever since you made this promise, you've felt a strange sense of destiny looming in your future-you might even think that Niska is now watching over your shoulder, just as she asked you to watch over her daughter. As a result of this eerie sense of being watched over, you've been able to react to dangerous situations more quickly than ever. As long as Koya remains alive, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks, and Perception becomes a class skill for you.

Everyone in town seems to admire Ameiko and Shalelu-they're heroes, after all, and played key roles in the recent troubles that plagued Sandpoint. You, though, take this admiration to a new level-you practically worship one of these two. This could be because you saw one of them perform a particularly impressive act of bravery at some point in the past, or maybe they just happened to give you the exact right words of encouragement or a kind gift at some point a few years ago when you were young and impressionable. In any case, they've done your best to emulate your hero's talents at spellcasting or combat. If your hero is Ameiko, you gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks. If your hero is Shalelu, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC against attacks of opportunity. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your hero.

At some point in the past, you had a terrifyingly close brush with death. Maybe a goblin nearly killed you during an attack on the town, or perhaps a building struck by a giant's boulder collapsed around you. Whatever the peril was, you would have certainly died if not for the swift actions of Koya or Shalelu, who intervened just in time to save your life. You've never forgotten this, and remain fiercely loyal to the NPC who saved you. Perhaps even more importantly, the method in which she saved you seems to have had an impact on your own skills. If Koya saved you, she did so by casting a healing spell on you just before you died, and as a result you gain a +2 trait bonus whenever you use cure spells to heal damage. If it was Shalelu who saved you, she did so by pulling you to safety while simultaneously defeating the peril that almost did you in, and as a result, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Acrobatics checks and Acrobatics is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your savior. NPC Choices: Koya, Shalelu.

Although she is seen as something of a mystery to most of Sandpoint's citizens, Shalelu has never really seemed all that mysterious to you. Of course, that's probably because she helped raise you. You have never quite figured out why Shalelu decided to treat you as a younger sibling, but you certainly appreciated it- and you eagerly absorbed all of the survivalist tricks that she showed you over the years. As a result, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all Survival checks, and Survival is a class skill for you.

You've lived your whole life in the shadow of your older sibling, a person who seems to have the adventure-filled lifestyle You've always wanted for yourself. While your sibling always took care of you, he or she never supported your desire to become an adventurer-your sibling never explained why, only saying, "Adventuring can cause a lot of pain just as easily as it can bring success and riches." As a younger sibling to one of Sandpoint's more inf luential citizens, you share some of that NPC's innate talent and skill at adventuring. If you're Ameiko's younger sibling, your ferocious independence and self-confidence give you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. If you're Sandru's younger sibling, your hearty constitution gives you a +1 trait bonus on all Fortitude saving throws. If you're Shalelu's younger sibling, your quick ref lexes give you a +1 trait bonus on all Ref lex saving throws. Note: Although you're a younger sibling of an established NPC, this doesn't necessarily lock you in to being the same race as that NPC-if you're a different race or ethnicity than the NPC you choose as your older sister or brother, you were adopted into the family by your parents.

(Human Only) One of your parents was a member of one of the great families of Brevoy, perhaps even of the line of Rogarvia itself. Yet you have no substantive proof of your nobility, and you've learned that claiming nobility without evidence makes you as good as a liar. While you might own a piece of jewelry, a scrap of once-rich fabric, or an aged confession of love, none of this directly supports your claim. Thus, you've lived your life in the shadow of nobility, knowing that you deserve the comforts and esteem of the elite, even though the contempt of fate brings you nothing but their scorn. Whether a recent attempt to prove your heritage has brought down the wrath of a noble family's henchmen or you merely seek to prove the worth of the blood in your veins, you've joined an expedition into the Stolen Lands, hoping to make a name all your own. You take a -1 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks made when dealing with members of Brevic nobility but gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves as a result of your stubbornness and individuality. (The penalty aspect of this trait is removed if you ever manage to establish yourself as a true noble.)

Lodovka: Your family has made a living off the coasts of the Lake of Mists and Veils since before Brevoy existed. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Swim checks, and Swim is always treated as a class skill for you. Your family motto is "The Waters, Our Fields."

Requirement(s) Legacy of Fire
You never knew your parents-perhaps they died when you were a child, or maybe you were taken from them and raised elsewhere as a slave. You owe your sanity and your life to a woman named Haleen. She could be your sister or merely a childhood companion, but whatever your relationship to her, she took care of you and protected you. She's always been a part of your life, and although her temper often kept her from making friends or keeping a job, she's always been kind to you. Haleen was instrumental in securing your freedom from slavery or making sure you got a good apprenticeship or job in society-but recently, she-d been growing strangely morose and depressed. You and Haleen normally kept no secrets, but whatever was bothering her wasn't something she shared with you. One night, she vanished, leaving you a brief note, begging you to forget her and to get on with your life, but something about the note bothered you'something in the way she phrased her words struck you as forced. You may be convinced she-d been kidnapped, forced to leave against her will, or even magically controlled, but you also suspect that she left you to protect you from something-that was ever her way. You're now convinced that it's time for you to step in and protect her, but you had no idea where she may have gone until recently. Several months have passed since she disappeared, and you've spent those months searching for clues to her location, and you've finally found a lead-a mysterious note, a strange dream, the result of a back-alley divination, or a report of a sighting of a woman matching Haleen's description has come to you, placing Haleen in the vicinity of an old ghost town named Kelmarane. What she's doing there and how she came to be there makes no sense to you yet, but the lead is the strongest one you've had. This and Garavel's advertisement for mercenaries to accompany him to the region is all the omen you need. You joined Garavel's group and eagerly await the day you'll be leaving for Kelmarane. Although Haleen chose to become a swashbuckling adventurer, she always encouraged you to seek your own path, and her support is the primary reason you chose the class you did at 1st level. This class is always a favored class to you, and your dedication to it is such that every time you take a level in the class, you gain +1 hit point and 1 additional skill point over and above what you would normally gain. If multiple PCs take this trait, they should be siblings who were both protected and raised by Haleen.

You grew up in rural Katapesh, in a region where gnoll activity was a fact of life. You killed your first gnoll at a young age when a group of gnoll slavers attacked your village, home, or caravan, and your hatred of gnolls has only grown since then. Something in your past fueled your hatred of gnolls even further- perhaps your family was slaughtered by gnolls, or maybe you even served a few harrowing weeks as a prisoner of a gnoll tribe before a miraculous escape. When you heard that Garavel was looking for brave men and women to aid in retaking the village of Kelmarane from a tribe of gnolls in the service of the notorious Carrion King, you knew you had to be part of the group, and signed up immediately. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made against gnolls. If you are a barbarian and you're fighting gnolls, your rage lasts 1 round longer than normal. If you're a ranger and you select humanoid (gnoll) as a favored enemy, your trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against gnolls increases to +2. If you're a spellcaster, you gain a +1 trait bonus to spell save DCs for damaging spells against gnolls.

You've spent much of the last several years serving your faith, and the conviction and dedication to your church has impressed many. Perhaps You've donated much of your personal wealth or time to serving the church, or you're the child of a powerful or well-loved member of the church, an orphan raised by the church, or a foundling with a strange birthmark that bears more than a passing resemblance to your faith's holy symbol. The faith has long supported you, and you are eager to repay the church in some way. In Katapesh, the establishment of a new village is always cause for interest to the nation's churches, as establishing new temples in villages is an excellent way to expand upon the church's resources and bring in more faithful. If the Pactmasters' plans to revitalize and rebuild Kelmarane are successful, the village will need a temple, and your faith is keenly interested in being represented there. This campaign trait is particularly suited to worshipers of Sarenrae, as Kelmarane was founded near an old monastery dedicated to the Dawnflower, and reconsecrating that monastery is of great interest to Sarenrae's church. Furthermore, a temple dedicated to her once stood in Kelmarane itself, but it has long since fallen into ruin; whispers among the religion tell that the church's old pastor may have fallen from grace and may even have been part of the cause of the hard times that befell the village. You've joined Garavel's band in hopes of helping to establish a new temple in the soon-to-be revitalized village. You've been selected for your dedication to the church and your strong social graces-pick one of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (religion), Perform (any), or Sense Motive. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks using that skill, and it is always considered a class skill for you.

Your were forced to flee the village when you were only a few years old, and you didn't discoverer this until a few years ago-perhaps you found an old document that revealed the truth, or maybe you learned the news from a relative. Both of your parents are now dead, and from what you've been able to piece together, one of your parents actually died in the village when whatever happened there happened. Your surviving parent spirited you away to safety to grow up elsewhere, but never spoke of Kelmarane and always told you that your other parent died when you were a child in a horrific tragedy like a fire or a flood that swept away the body. Now that you've started to uncover the truth, you are convinced that your heritage remains hidden in Kelmarane. Whether you just wish to find out what really happened to your parent that died there or you want to rebuild the village in his or her honor is up to you-but Garavel's caravan to the village is just the opportunity you've been waiting for. When your other parent died recently, among his or her effects was a single item that once belonged to the parent who died at Kelmarane. This item is your most valued possession-a piece of jewelry worth 350 gp, any masterwork weapon or armor worth no more than 350 gp, or a wand containing any 1st-level spell (CL 1st) with only 20 charges remaining. If you ever lose this item, your resulting depression imposes a -1 penalty on Will saves for 1 year.

Requirement(s) Legacy of Fire
The Pathfinder Society has long intrigued you-tales of the exotic lands and strange discoveries made by Pathfinders have enchanted your dreams and fired your imagination since childhood. When Pathfinders came through your village or neighborhood, they immediately enthralled you with their stories and knowledge. Yet at the time, you were far too young to join them, and when they left for adventure you had to stay behind. Now that you are of age, you've traveled to Absalom to apply for membership. The application process went well, and you're now a full member. Your first assignment is to accompany Garavel's group to Kelmarane-the Pathfinder Society has heard rumors of several ancient structures in the area, including a ruined monastery once dedicated to Sarenrae, and would like to learn more about them. Even more pressing is the mystery of what brought about Kelmarane's ruin in the first place-reports of which are vague at best. If you can determine the cause of the village's abandonment so many years ago, you're sure the Society would be impressed. You begin the game with your own wayfinder, a loan from your venture-captain. you've promised to pay your venturecaptain 500 gp for the wayfinder some day, but for now it's yours to use. A wayfinder is a magical compass that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, and can be commanded to emit light as the spell (CL 5th) as a standard action. Further details on the Pathfinder Society and wayfinders may be found in the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting (pages 194-195) or Seekers of Secrets.

Osirion has a history stretching back over 8,000 years, and the deities worshiped today in modern Osirion are not the same ones revered in Ancient Osirion's heyday-deities with names like Anubis, Osiris, Ra, and Set, among others.

In addition, your faith in the old gods of Osirion grants you a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against divine magic.

Accidental Clone [<a href="traitdisplay88a6.html">Link</a>]

Requirement(s) Return of the Runelords
Adventuring has been in your blood for as long as you can remember, and this urge to go out and explore the world left you recently in over your head when you (foolishly or bravely, depending on how you look at it) decided to explore an old Thassilonian ruin near your home town. The adventure ended in tragedy when you set off a devastating trap while investigating a statue of a beautiful woman'someone you believed to be one of the ancient runelords of Thassilon. The trap slaughtered your entire party-including you.

You woke from death some time later, your memories intact but your body transformed. No longer did you resemble your previous self-you instead looked like the woman depicted in the statue. Now, you've joined up with a new group of adventurers; despite your tragic first attempt at dungeon delving, your thirst for adventure has returned stronger than ever. You're sure that this time you'll be able to keep your fellow explorers alive, and the strange dreams you've been having ever since you came back to life in your new body-a body that your research has revealed was originally intended to be a clone of none other than Sorshen, the Runelord of Lust-have only further solidified in your mind the fact that you and your companions are destined for greatness.

Your character must be human if you take this trait (though you may retain your previous gender identity). Your ethnicity is Azlanti, but you are not pure-blooded-you have the standard human ability score adjustments. Your resemblance to Sorshen may have unexpected side effects as the campaign progresses, for good or for ill. In any event, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks, and these skills are always class skills for you.

Once per adventure, you can retroactively apply a +20 trait bonus to a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect after you learn the outcome of the roll. A saving throw result of a natural 1 still automatically fails, but if the +20 bonus adjusts the save so that it is successful, you treat the failed saving throw as a successful one.

Unless the GM approves, only one PC in the group can have the Accidental Clone trait.

Audrahni's Ally [<a href="traitdisplay4813.html">Link</a>]

Requirement(s) Return of the Runelords
While every PC should be at least passingly familiar with the elven gravedigger Audrahni, you are one of the few in town she counts as a true friend. Work with the GM to determine what sort of common ground you and Audrahni share. Perhaps you worship a deity whose teachings parallel her vocation (such as Ashava or Pharasma). Maybe you're a Forlorn elf and you sense a kindred spirit within her. With the GM's permission you may have known her in Magnimar before meeting her once again upon arriving in Roderic's Cove. Or perhaps you merely share a similar passion for arcana, dancing, history, magic, or religion. More details about Audrahni appear in the adventures, but she's a mysterious woman who's close lipped about her past-and so you'll need to work with your GM to have a stronger relationship at the campaign's outset.

Audrahni trusts you, and she's shared one element of her past with you since befriending you. Choose one of the following questions. At the start of the campaign, the GM will give you a brief answer about Audrahni's past. Once you know the answer, you should fashion a parallel event in your own PC's history, creating a shared misery or memory with Audrahni. The fact that you've met someone else who had a similar event in their past has bolstered your own resolve, and has granted you a +1 trait bonus to the saving throw determined by the question you select.

"What happened to your parents"?: Grants a +1 trait bonus to Fortitude saving throws.

"Where did you grow up"?: Grants a +1 trait bonus to Reflex saving throws.

"What historical figure inspired you the most"?: Grants a +1 trait bonus to Will saving throws.

Once per adventure as a standard action, you may concentrate on the bond you and Audrahni share. The strong emotions brought on by these memories bolster your desire to forge ahead and remain alive, granting you the effects of one of the following spells at a caster level equal to your character level: <a href="spelldisplay6e9f.html?ItemName=calm%20emotions">calm emotions</a>, <a href="spelldisplayb58c.html?ItemName=cure%20moderate%20wounds">cure moderate wounds</a>, or <a href="spelldisplayc2fb.html?ItemName=restoration,%20lesser">lesser restoration</a>.

Requirement(s) Return of the Runelords
You and another PC are close allies-friends, lovers, siblings, or even twins. Work with the other player to build a shared history-both you and the other player must choose Close Allies as a campaign trait, and both must agree to the nature of the relationship between the two characters. (At the GM's option, more than two PCs can be linked by this trait.) You and your close ally have always supported each other. You might have the tendency to complete each other's sentences, dress similarly, share the same religion or faith, or have endured a dangerous event together in the past. If you and the other player agree (and have chosen either the siblings or twins option below), you might not even particularly like your close "ally," yet you still respect them and can utilize this trait's benefits all the same.

If your relationship with your close ally ends (as a result of death, a parting of ways, or other catastrophe), you immediately lose this campaign trait and replace it with <a href="traitdisplayff5c.html">Spirit Touched</a> as a result of your emotional distress.

When you and the other PC agree to take this shared trait, you must also agree on the nature of your characters' bond by choosing one of the following: friends, lovers, siblings, or twins. If you choose twins, both PCs must be of the same race. If you choose siblings, one or both of you are adopted if you aren't of the same race.

Whenever you are adjacent to your close ally, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws.

Once per adventure as an immediate action, you may grant your close ally a bonus equal to the result of 1d6 to a single d20 roll. You must have line of sight to your ally to use this ability. You may choose to grant this bonus after your ally has rolled, but must do so before the result of the roll is known.

After living so long in the shadow of these enormous ruins, you were intrigued to find out that they were much older than anyone could have guessed and that the runelords who built them may still exist. You've made a promise to yourself to uncover all that you can about Thassilon, its runelords, and the mysterious history of that ancient civilization.

You gain Thassilonian as a bonus language, and at 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a bonus skill rank that can only be applied to Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (history), Linguistics, or Use Magic Device.

Once per adventure, you may either take 20 on a Use Magic Device check or activate a charged magic item without expending any charges.

Your character has a personal link or association with one of Varisia's established heroes. This hero should be a PC you played in a previous campaign (and could be, but need not be, one of the Sihedron Heroes). Your character could be a younger sibling, younger cousin, or even an apprentice of the hero.

You've always felt separated from the era into which you were born. Perhaps you feel that you were born too late, and that you and your interests are better suited to a previous age. Maybe you have the conviction you were born too soon, and that your true destiny lies in some distant future. You might be suffering from missing time-whether a few hours, a few weeks, or even several months-for which you have no memories. You might instead receive brief visions of friends or enemies much older or younger than their actual age. You've long since grown used to this strange condition, but have not yet determined why you suffer from it. Your GM will be provided with additional information about this trait's strange nature in the third adventure of Return of the Runelords.

You have a knack for knowing when to act a few instants in advance and gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks. Once per adventure as an immediate action, you may use your strange link to the flow of time to force the GM to reroll a single d20 roll. You must declare the use of this ability immediately after the GM rolls the d20, but you can choose to do so after learning the results of the roll.

Requirement(s) Second Darkness
You've always seemed to have trouble keeping money. Worse, you always seem to have debts looming over your head. When you heard about the "Cheat the Devil and Take His Gold" gambling tournament, you felt in your gut that your luck was about to change. You've always been optimistic, in fact, and even though right now is one of those rare times where you don't owe anyone any money (you just paid off a recent loan from local moneylender Lymas Smeed), you know that'll change soon enough. Better to start amassing money now when you're at one of those rare windfall times! You've set aside a gold coin for the entrance fee, and look forward to making it big-you can feel it in your bones! This time's gonna be the big one! Your boundless optimism, even in the face of crushing situations, has always bolstered your spirit. Effects that grant you morale bonuses persist 1d4 rounds longer than they normally would as a result.

Requirement(s) Second Darkness
You've come (or been sent) to Riddleport to observe the strange Blot that has appeared in the city's sky. You've decided to put your keen senses to the test at the Golden Goblin's upcoming gambling competition while you're here. Your sharp eyesight makes it easier for you to notice things at a distance. For you, Perception checks only start increasing in difficulty at a range of 20 feet or farther, as opposed to the normal 10. This has no effect on checks made to perceive things within 10 feet.

Requirement(s) Second Darkness
You may or may not be seeking membership into Riddleport's most prestigious magical guild, the Order of Cyphers, but you certainly have heard their call for aid in determining the nature of the strange shadow in the sky above Riddleport. You arrived in town several days ago and had some issues with security and safety at several inns before you finally settled on the Gold Goblin; you've been staying there as a guest for several days now, and the owner, Saul Vancaskerkin, seems like a nice guy. He's even given you a pass to attend the gambling tournament he's about to throw-you're not sure how into gambling you'll be, but perhaps there'll be some visitors from out of town you can talk to about the strange shadow in the sky. At the very least, you're hoping someone at the tourney will be into magic-there's not really enough folk in this town who seem all that interested in magic, you've found. Your interest in magic dates back quite far, and as a result, you've developed a knack for identifying common magical items at a glance. You can use Spellcraft to identify magic items in the same way you can use Spellcraft to identify a potion. The DC to identify a magic item is equal to 20 + the item's caster level.

Requirement(s) Second Darkness
You belong to an organization (most likely a religion) that has definite views on the menace posed by the lower planes. The willfulness with which the city of Korvosa (they even allow a temple of Asmodeus to operate in broad daylight!) tolerates infernal influences is, to you and your organization, the greatest symbol of what's wrong with civilization today. And now, in Riddleport, there's news that a gambling tournament is using devils and Hell as an idle decoration. It's likely that this is just an example of poor taste, but there's a chance that something sinister may be lurking beneath the goings-on at the Gold Goblin. You have been contacted by your organization (or may have decided on your own) to travel to Riddleport (if you don't already live there) and attend this tournament under the guise of a patron. Keep an eye on things there, even after the tournament is over; if you can, get a job working for the owner. Demons and devils can be subtle, and it could take weeks or even months to find proof of their involvement. Your near-obsessive hatred of all things fiendish grants you a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls made against foes you know to be evil outsiders.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
While you aren't necessarily a native of Cheliax, you boarded the Jenivere at one of that country's port cities. As the people of Cheliax generally know the Mwangi Expanse as a near legendary land home to strange beasts and exotic treasures, your views of the region have a distinctly romantic tinge, and the desire for fame, wealth, and adventure likely motivate your travels. You begin the campaign with a detailed map of the Mwangi Expanse (this grants +2 competence bonus on all Knowledge [geography] checks made regarding this region) and 200 gp worth of mundane equipment to aid your exploration of the jungle.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
Your travels have brought you to the Jenivere through the dangerous port of Ilizmagorti, home to both pirates and assassins. Perhaps you're f leeing a price on your head, perhaps you've jumped ship from another vessel, or perhaps you're merely looking for a new start in a land where the dangers make themselves more obvious. Your familiarity with subtle slayings and toxins grants you a +2 trait bonus on all saves against poison. In addition, you can pick one type of poison listed below to be immune to, having undergone a long and painful process of building up an immunity to its effects: blue whinnis, giant wasp poison, medium spider venom, small centipede poison, or spider vine poison (a poison derived from a toxic plant native to the Mwangi Expanse).

You boarded the Jenivere in the Mwangi Expanse, where you've lived or recently traveled through.

Your last home was in the Shackles, a dangerous land of pirates and treachery, but also of fantastic opportunity. A life of weal and woe on the sea and amid the pirate controlled lands has toughened you to a variety of hardships.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
Traveling from lands far to the north, you likely have little experience with the jungle, its denizens, or its strange forces. Just as the lands of Garund are wild and exotic to you, so are you to them. This unusualness manifests in one of two ways. Choose to gain either a +2 trait bonus on all Bluff checks made against inhabitants of the jungle, or treat your spells with the mind-affecting descriptor as being +1 caster level higher when cast against creatures and natives of the jungle.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
You come from a long line of Sargavan colonists, stretching back to Cheliax's original expansion into the land during the Everwar. While your people's control of Sargava wanes every day, and Eleder has functioned independently from Cheliax since House Thrune brought diabolism to the political forefront, you nevertheless maintain a hardy Chelish constitution and natural sense of survival. What took you away from home is up to you, but you return to the land of your birth on the Jenivere in the hope of putting Sargava back on the map. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks relating to Sargavan settlements and politics and a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against disease.

Characters with this trait are Sargavan natives and might be returning via any city, but especially from the Chelish ports of Kintargo, Pezzack, or Corentyn.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
Sea trade is never safe, even on the highly trafficked waters of the Inner Sea, but the way to Eleder is more perilous still. The ever-present hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego blows hundreds of ships each year off course, into jagged rocks, or directly to the sea f loor. Pirates operating out of the Shackles Isles wait on the other side to take cargo from ships lucky enough to traverse or bypass the storm. Your job is to ensure a precious cargo aboard the Jenivere arrives safely in Eleder-what form this cargo takes and the nature of your relationship to it are up to you and your GM. Your character's history as a merchant or mercenary has earned her a respectable living, and you begin the campaign with an additional 300 gp in starting wealth.

Characters with this trait likely boarded in Magnimar, Corentyn, Ilizmagorti, Port Peril, or Bloodcove.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
This trip to Eleder is just one of many in a long career as a sailor aboard the Jenivere and other cargo vessels. Whether you joined the crew with the hope of one day captaining your own ship, as the means of paying your way to a foreign port with sweat and blood, or as a slave or indentured servant, you now call the ship home. Pick one of the following skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (geography), Swim, or Survival. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and that skill is always treated as a class skill for you.

Characters with this trait have likely been on the Jenivere since it departed Magnimar.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
The Mwangi Expanse is one of the richest regions in all of Golarion, and also one of the most mysterious. Despite its history of countless years and its fostering of nameless empires, very little is known of the Mwangi Expanse by outsiders or even natives of the primeval, jungle-covered land. You have long studied the region and its lore, and count yourself among a small handful of genuine experts throughout the Inner Sea. The Jenivere promises to take you to the very subject of your fascination, and you eagerly await firsthand investigation of the deep jungles and cyclopean ruins of Garund's interior. You gain Polyglot as a bonus language and receive a +1 trait bonus on all Knowledge (history) checks regarding the Mwangi Expanse.

Characters with this trait likely boarded the Jenivere in Ilizmagorti or one of the cities of the Shackles or the Mwangi Expanse.

Requirement(s) Serpent's Skull
Not all passengers on seafaring vessels are legal or even known to the captain and crew, and the Jenivere is no exception. Whether too poor to book legal passage on the ship or fearing discovery by customs officials in your home port, you or an ally stowed away on the ship in secret. This may mean that the crew doesn't know you're on board, or perhaps they do now but didn't when the ship set sail. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks and Survival checks to find food.

Characters with this trait might have boarded the Jenivere at any port, but especially in the cities of the Shackles.

You are a member of one of Magnimar's wealthiest families' or rather, you used to be. A falling-out left you disowned and disinherited.

Despite your exile, your name still carries considerable weight in Magnimar, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made within the city. Additionally, you start play with a noble's outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. Your last name is probably Derexhi, Kaddren, Mindurian, Niroden, Scarnetti, Valdemar, Vanderale, or Versade (but may be another of your choosing; see Magnimar, City of Monuments).

Though you were raised as a member of one of Magnimar's various Sczarni gangs, you never fit in with the rest of your settled, metropolitan brethren. The Pathfinder Society in particular recognized your wanderlust and potential as an agent, and on more than one occasion you impressed or bamboozled their agents with your street smarts and finesse. Over the years, you fell out of favor with the Sczarni, and eventually left to pursue interests outside of simple banditry, though you still remember the lessons your criminal relations taught you.

As a child in Magnimar, the city's ancient monuments inspired you with wonder. Your fascination with these relics has only grown in the years since, encouraging you to join the ranks of the Pathfinder Society so you can further quench your thirst for knowledge. Though you know little about the actual lore of the monuments, you've studied these colossal works extensively, developing an in-depth knowledge of some of the city's most famous landmarks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) checks made in Varisia due to your familiarity with its historical remnants. This bonus increases to +2 if the check relates to the city of Magnimar.

While the mercantile industries of Magnimar appeal to your keen eye for monetary gain, you know that the boldest route to true fortune lays in hunting down rare relics and selling them to the highest bidder. Becoming a Pathfinder seemed like an obvious decision, allowing you to travel throughout Varisia in your search for wealth, so you signed up right away. You brought with you a sharp eye and keen ability to distinguish fakes from the genuine article. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise checks.

You went to a tavern called the Formidably Maid in Port Peril to earn a few coins with your tales of the sea. The patrons seemed pleased with your performance and bought you a few drinks.

One of your legs was bitten off below the knee by a shark when you were just a child, and was replaced with a wooden peg leg (Pathfinder Player Companion: Pirates of the Inner Sea 20). You've long since gotten used to your prosthesis, however, and take none of the normal penalties from having a peg leg. You've had to learn to deal with the pain of your injury as well, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves. Ever since your accident You've hated sharks, and you also gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against sharks and other animals with the aquatic subtype.

Your balance always gets a bit shaky after a few drinks, and last night at the Formidably Maid-a tavern in Port Peril-was no exception. That must be why you fell to the floor as soon as you tried to stand up. What happened next is hazy, but you're pretty sure you were dragged out of the bar and onto a ship at the docks. At least they didn't throw you to the sharks...

On a ship, a sailor often has to learn multiple skills, and this rule certainly applies to you. Your father was a woodworker, and you learned your first trade from him. But on your first voyage at sea you quickly found out that a carpenter is often a ship's doctor as well-after all, who knows more about sawing off limbs than someone who saws wood for a living? People are a lot bloodier than wood, that's for sure, but you haven't had many complaints-those sailors who have enjoyed your services are either happy to be alive or dead, and there's old salts who swear the peg legs you for made them are better than the real legs they used to have. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Craft (carpentry) and Heal checks, and Heal is a class skill for you.

You were between ships in Port Peril, and after stopping for a drink at a tavern called the Formidably Maid, you happened upon a damsel in distress in the alleyway outside. Thinking you could help, you didn't notice the thugs hiding nearby, and they caught you unawares. You've been on enough ships to know a press gang by the blow of the sap on the back of your neck-you just hope whatever ship you end up on needs a surgeon. Although the majority of your equipment was taken away when you were press-ganged, you managed to hang on to a fully stocked healer's kit, and you begin the campaign with it, regardless of your starting circumstances.

You've always felt the call of the sea and your blood surges with the ebb and flow of the tides.

In addition, penalties on attack rolls made underwater are lessened by 1.

You came to Port Peril in search of your destiny, and after a few drinks at a tavern called the Formidably Maid, you went down to the docks to take in a view of the sea. The last thing you remember is a blow to the back of your head and the waves rushing up to meet you.

You awake with a strange sensation beyond the frightening experience of extensive memory loss.

You can't explain it, but you know that you've always been easy to set off, and your first instinct when pressed into a corner is to lash out.

You wake from your recent ordeal with a sense of shame, as if you had sinned deeply against your morals and beliefs. However, you feel a bit of relief as well, as if your god had granted you a second chance. You not only have a drive to figure out what happened to you, but an urge to fight back against the unspeakable forces of evil. If, during the course of your investigation, you discover that you took part in unsavory activities that would normally be opposed to your faith or alignment, this event no longer has any impact with your standing in the eyes of your god due to your renewed righteous convictions.

You belong to a noble family that matters in Taldor, though as the story begins you may or may not be on good terms with your relatives. Your upbringing among the city's well-to-do gives you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With Princess Eutropia's efforts to provide for Taldor's common citizens and overturn years of tradition, new lines are being quietly drawn in the sand, and you have found yourself embroiled in these intrigues whether you intended to be or not.

Either way, you know the system is broken, and you've dedicated your life to fixing it. But tradition rules Taldor as much as any Grand Prince, and change requires more influence than you have- so far. you've got a few friends and allies, and plenty of determination, but while you work toward the power you need to change the nation, you'll have to resort to more discrete ways of righting wrongs and curbing the abuses of the upper class. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you can call upon your coconspirators to have "made arrangements" on your behalf, allowing you to attempt a Knowledge (local) check in place of a single Bluff, Disable Device, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand check. The DC of this Knowledge (local) check is equal to the DC of the skill check it replaces. Whatever arrangements you make-for doors left unlocked, guards strong-armed out of your way, stolen keys left for you to find-must be reasonable to have anticipated and achieved beforehand; you could arrange to have a noble convinced you're a very important diplomat traveling in disguise, for example, but if a fight breaks out you could not rely on your network of contacts to feint for you in combat. You don't have to use this ability in advance; you can announce its use as you encounter a challenge, implying you foresaw this challenge and made arrangements prior to your arrival.

You always tended to get in over your head as a child, but your biggest youthful misadventure was the time you "accidentally" found yourself behind enemy lines in the Worldwound. You probably never would have made it back home to Kenabres if not for the help of a mysterious woman who helped you trick your way through a group of cultists. The woman never told you her name, but you remember her beauty and a deep sense of sadness she seemed to carry with her. Her skill with the bow was impressive as well, but the thing you remember most about her was the symbol of Desna she wore'she often held onto it without seeming to realize it, as if the connection to the goddess was something she clung to in a sense of need, as someone might clutch at a rope while dangling over a vast pit. She left your side a few moments before you were picked up by a patrol of crusaders, who finished the job of escorting you back to safety, and you've never seen her again. Ever since, you've just been lucky when it comes to trickery. Once per day, if you fail an Acrobatics, Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check, you may immediately reroll that check as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. Associated Mythic Path: Trickster. Multiple Characters: You and other characters were all saved by the same mysterious woman in your childhood. This could have been the same event, or she could have saved you on separate occasions-the discovery that someone else was saved by the mysterious stranger has resulted in a long friendship (or perhaps friendly rivalry) with the others she rescued.

Child of the Crusades (WotR) [<a href="traitdisplay1bb2.html">Link</a>]

Requirement(s) Wrath of the Righteous
Your parents were members of the crusade, as were their parents before them. (If you are an elf, gnome, or other long-lived race, these could be brothers or cousins instead, since it's possible that the Worldwound simply didn't exist at a time before you were born.) The righteousness of the crusades sometimes feels as if it runs in your very blood, and it bolsters you against demonic inf luence. Your parents may be alive still, or they may have perished on a mission-that choice is up to you. You grew up knowing them, though, and their zeal and devotion to the crusade is the primary reason you feel the same way. They've told you of other family members who have also been involved in the crusade, and it's not uncommon for you to meet a distant cousin or long-lost aunt, uncle, or other family member while traveling among the border towns of Mendev. This strong family tie bolsters your mind and sense of belonging to the crusade. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would possess or incapacitate you mentally, you may immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. Associated Mythic Path: Marshal. Multiple Characters: If other characters take this trait, you should all be related-you can be siblings, cousins, or even more distant relations, but you should all be aware of this shared lineage.

Exposed to Awfulness [<a href="traitdisplay7f50.html">Link</a>]

Requirement(s) Wrath of the Righteous
When you were a child, you were nearly slain by a demon that managed to make its way through the wardstones into the lands beyond. The demon was slain before it could kill you, but you lingered at death's door in a coma for weeks before waking. Ever since then, you've been unusually hale and hearty, as if your body had endured its brush with awfulness by becoming supernaturally fit. But still, the scars (whether physical or purely mental) of your brush with death remain, and nightmares of what could have happened often plague your sleep. Something, be it your own personal force of will, some strange "infection" from the assault, or perhaps a combination of both, has made you stronger than before. You're not sure what to make of the theories that you survived this exposure to awfulness because you yourself have some trace of demonic heritage that helped give you the advantage you needed to survive- but whatever it was, you're glad for it! Your strange resistance to demonic attacks persists to this day. Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would kill or physically incapacitate you, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. Associated Mythic Path: Guardian. Multiple Characters: You and any others with this trait are related, if only distantly. You could be siblings or cousins-a condition that perhaps lends some credence to the theory that all of you share more than just a common bloodline.

Requirement(s) Wrath of the Righteous
You bear a strange birthmark on your body'something you've learned is the Sign of the Seeker's Spiral, a rune associated with the secret society known as the Riftwardens. You have researched this rune, and have learned that the mark sometimes appears on the children of Riftwardens who have been exposed to particularly strange planar energies. Unfortunately, you never knew your parents, for you were raised by a foster family in Kenabres. Your foster family has conf irmed that both of your parents were Riftwardens, and has further conf irmed that your parents went missing on a secret mission into the Worldwound less than a month after you were born. You're not sure what happened to them, but you're certain you're dead-and your gut tells you that the one who murdered them yet lives! In any event, you've long felt magic in your blood, and casting spells comes easily to you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all concentration checks. Associated Mythic Path: Archmage. Multiple Characters: You should be siblings with any other character that takes this trait, so that you share the same missing parents. Your parents could even be foster parents.

Requirement(s) Wrath of the Righteous
You were forced to take part in a demonic ritual as a youth after having been captured by cultists. Whatever the ritual's purpose may have been, it didn't work out the way your captors envisioned-rather than corrupting your soul, you absorbed the ritual's energy and made it your own before you escaped to safety. Ever since, you've been haunted by strange nightmares about the ritual, and have long felt that the energies it bathed you in have changed you. Recently, those energies have changed- it's as if you've finally managed to come to terms with your past and have turned the ritual's aftereffects to your advantage, following the old adage of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. you've been unable to learn more about the ritual or what it was for, but the question lingers in the back of your head to this day. This nagging has instilled in you a fury against demonkind. Today, when you face demons in combat, those energies bolster your fury, granting you a +2 trait bonus on all combat maneuver checks against demons. Associated Mythic Path: Champion. Multiple Characters: You and any other PC who takes this trait were all part of the same ritual, and it was only by working together that you managed to escape-further, the support of your fellow ritual survivors has played a key role in your coming to terms with it, and you retain a close bond of friendship (or perhaps a friendly rivalry) to this day.

Touched by Divinity [<a href="traitdisplay4472.html">Link</a>]

Requirement(s) Wrath of the Righteous
As long as you can remember, you've had an unexplainable interest in one deity in particular. One of your parents may have been a priest of this deity, or you may have been an orphan raised by the church, but these alone cannot explain your deep connection to the faith. you've always felt calm and at ease in places holy to the deity, and often have dreams about the god or goddess visiting you-most often in the form of a sacred animal or creature. Your faith is strong, even if you don't happen to be a divine spellcaster-if you are a divine spellcaster, you should be a worshiper of this deity. You begin play with a silver holy symbol of your chosen deity for free. In addition, choose one domain associated with your chosen deity. You gain the use of that domain's 1st-level domain spell as a spell-like ability usable once per day (CL equals your character level). Associated Mythic Path: Hierophant. Multiple Characters: If other characters choose this trait, you should all work together to decide what deity you're associated with-it should be the same deity shared by all of you. You might even share the same dreams.
