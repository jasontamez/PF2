You cling tenaciously to a faith that is doubted by many, perhaps based around a god who has vanished, or was never a god in the first place. You refuse to forsake your beliefs despite all evidence, perhaps due to a need to belong, respect for tradition, or a religious experience. As a result, it is nearly impossible to convince you of your deity's absence. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Will saving throws against fear effects.

Like a climber ascending a mountain, you gradually grow acclimatized to an opposing planar alignment. For each consecutive day you remain on a mildly aligned plane that opposes your alignment, reduce your penalty on Charisma-based checks by 1, to a minimum of 0. This does not affect the penalty from a strongly aligned plane.

Your religious studies hinged on teachings rarely recognized by your faith. You can select one of the apocryphal subdomains detailed below, provided the subdomain is associated with your patron deity. In some cases, you can select a subdomain associated with a deity despite that deity not offering the associated domain-these exceptions are noted with an asterisk (*), and you gain domain powers and domain spells from the associated domain as usual, even though your deity normally doesn't grant access to that domain. When selecting a subdomain associated with two domains, a priest can choose only a subdomain that modifies a domain to which he has access.
