The subtle power of the deep places of the world flows within you, and grants you mastery of summoning beings of earth and stone. Any creature you conjure with a summon spell that has the earth subtype or a burrow speed gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +1 enhancement bonus to Armor Class for the duration of the spell that summoned it.
