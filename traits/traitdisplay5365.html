Requirement(s) Geb
Survival in Geb requires convincing your betters that you would be of more service to them if they let you live another day than if they turn you into an unliving thrall, and you have mastered the art of buying time against undead attacks. Once per day as a swift action, you can use sanctuary as a spell-like ability (caster level = your highest caster level, or 1st if you have no caster level), with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your caster level (minimum 0) + your Charisma modifier. Only undead must save to attack you (other creature types are not affected). The effect ends as soon as you attack a creature, as normal.
