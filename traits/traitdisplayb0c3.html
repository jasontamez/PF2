Songs of your glory and prowess bolster your strength. When you are the subject of any sonic effect that grants a morale bonus on attack or damage rolls, you also gain a +1 trait bonus on Strengthbased skill checks; on combat maneuver checks to bull rush, grapple, and reposition; and to your CMD against those combat maneuvers.
