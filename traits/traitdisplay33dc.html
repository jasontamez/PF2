Somewhere in your family line, the mystic power of red dragons was infused into one of your relatives. If you ever take a class that requires you to select a draconic heritage, you must select a red dragon as your type. After successfully completing a charge attack, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Will saves for a full round.
