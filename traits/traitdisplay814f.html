Your faith in the empyreal lords accommodates numerous gods, and you are gifted at adapting their wide variety of focuses and lessons to your own life. Select either the law or chaos alignment descriptor. You may cast spells with that descriptor, even if your alignment or that of your god would normally not allow it. Doing so applies the good descriptor to the spell if it does not already apply.
