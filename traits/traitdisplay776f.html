Category Basic (Magic)
One of your parents was exposed to
uncontrolled magic or arcane pollution before you were
born, causing you to develop a minor mutation that has
marked you as different all your life. You have a third
eye on your forehead. As long as it is uncovered and
open, you can get a clearer sense of the emotions of those
you see, granting you a +2 trait bonus on Sense Motive
checks that increases to +4 on checks to notice whether a
character is under a mind-affecting effect. However, the
eye is unsettling, and you take a -1 penalty on Bluff and
Diplomacy checks against humanoids who can see it.

Suggested Characters: Lamashtans, Mana Wastes
natives, Nexians.
