Your body never lets down its defenses, even when you rest. The DC for Perception checks you attempt while asleep increases only by 7 (instead of the normal +10 increase). While you are dazed, stunned, or helpless, each critical hit or sneak attack scored against you has a 25% chance of being negated; when a critical hit or sneak attack is negated, roll its damage normally. This doesn't stack with the fortification armor special ability and similar effects.
