Your interest in magic was inspired by
witnessing a spell being cast in a particularly dramatic
method, perhaps even one that affected you physically
or spiritually. This early exposure to magic has made it
easier for you to work similar magic on your own. Pick
one spell when you choose this trait-from this point
on, whenever you cast that spell, its effects manifest at +1
caster level.
