Requirement(s) Code of Perseverance
If you follow this code, you are keenly aware of the value of actions as well as goods. Once per day while haggling with a merchant or striking a bargain with another intelligent creature, you can spend a number of gold pieces equal to your level ?? 10 in order to reroll a Diplomacy check you just made, before the results are revealed. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. In addition, you begin play with a set of extravagant noble's clothes worth 100 gp.
