Requirement(s) Gorum
You have fought in several
battles, and each time felt the presence of Gorum guiding
your sword-arm, making you ready to act at a moment's
notice. You gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks, and if
you are able to act during a surprise round, you may draw
a weapon (but not a potion or magic item) as a free action
during that round.
