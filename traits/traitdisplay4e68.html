You have a vicious streak, and nothing
satisfies you more than warm blood on your hands and
blade. Whenever you make an attack that reduces a foe to
0 hit points or fewer or you confirm a critical hit, your
attack deals 1 additional point of damage. The additional
damage is a trait bonus, and is multiplied by your weapon's
critical hit multiplier.
