Often forced to go without food or stimulation for days at a time, you have learned to use prolonged sleep as a means of escape and a way to heal your wounds. You heal temporary ability damage at a rate of 3 points per day of complete bed rest. A normal night of rest (8 hours) still heals you at a rate of only 1 point of temporary ability damage per night of rest.
