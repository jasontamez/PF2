The blood of the early horse tribes is strong in your family. Breeding, riding, selecting, and training the best horses are all part of your legacy, and you know how to pick out the best of the lot when selecting a suitable mount. If you gain a horse as an animal companion or mount as one of your class abilities, its base speed increases by 5 feet and it gains a bonus trick that does not count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal.
