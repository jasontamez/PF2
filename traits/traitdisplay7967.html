As a child, you were whisked away to the
First World by mischievous fey for a time. When you
returned, you were ever after considered odd and distant.
You long to return there, and find the mortal world dull
and at times revolting, so you do not eat as you should and
do not question strange visions. You take a -2 penalty on
saving throws against disease, illusions, and poison of all
kinds, as well as against the spells, spell-like abilities, and
supernatural abilities of fey.
