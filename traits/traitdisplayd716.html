Explore, report, and cooperate. This is the credo you've lived by since you've joined the Pathfinder Society, and after hearing about the expedition to found Talmandor's Bounty you applied, eager to see the remains of Azlant. However, you quickly learned that the Bountiful Venture Company wasn't interested in involving the Pathfinder Society in the formation of the colony. This struck you as strange, because who else has as keen an understanding of some of the elements of ancient Azlant as the Pathfinder Society? Regardless, you went through the application process, making sure to highlight all of your applicable skills and experience while keeping your involvement in the Society to yourself. You were elated to receive notice that you were selected for the second wave of colonists bound for the broken continent of Azlant. You begin play with a standard <a href="magicwondrousdisplay10e5.html?FinalName=Wayfinder">wayfinder</a> and you gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks.
