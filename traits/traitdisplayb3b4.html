For unknown reasons, you have deeper reserves of magical energy than those around you. Perhaps you are descended from a family of powerful arcane casters, or maybe you believe this trait marks you as destined for magical greatness.

This does not always have to be the same spell-like ability-one day you might use dancing lights twice, only to use the additional casting for speak with animals the next day.
