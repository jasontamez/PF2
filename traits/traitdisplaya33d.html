Category Basic (Combat)
You made your first kill at a very young age and
found the task of war or murder to your liking. You either
take particular pride in a well-placed blow, or find vile
pleasure in twisting the blade to maximize your target's
pain. You deal an amount of additional damage equal
to your weapon's critical hit modifier when you score a
successful critical hit with a weapon; this additional
damage is added to the final total, and is not multiplied
by the critical hit multiple itself. This extra damage is a
trait bonus.
