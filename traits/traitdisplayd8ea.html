Although you were born and lived on Golarion, you recently awakened in a strange vault with no memory of how you got there, surrounded by sleeping creatures of every shape and size in smooth glass eggs, all watched over by uncommunicative crablike automatons. As a side effect of your stasis, you gain all the benefits of 8 hours of sleep in only 2 hours. This allows a spellcaster who must rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day.
