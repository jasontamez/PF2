You can suppress your own memories to help tell more convincing lies. Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause yourself to forget a single event or fact for a period of 10 minutes. Enemies reading your mind cannot learn the information. Until the memory returns, you gain a +10 trait bonus on Bluff checks to convince others that you do not know the information.
