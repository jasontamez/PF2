One of your ancestors came in contact with the mystical black blood (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Into the Darklands 51), granting you an affinity for the substance. You are immune to the negative effects of black blood. Once per day as a swift action, you can channel the essence of black blood, increasing your effective caster level by 1 for any 1st-or 2nd-level necromancy spell you cast. Your blood is pitch black as a result of this trait.
