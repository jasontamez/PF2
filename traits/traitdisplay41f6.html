Requirement(s) Taldor
When the ceaseless bickering and elaborate posturing of Taldan politics proves ineffective, it is not unheard of for the nobility of Taldor to turn to poison to solve their problems, and therefore many are taught to identify the telltale signs of commonly used toxins. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against ingested poisons. Additionally, you can cast detect poison as a spell-like ability once per day, using your character level as your caster level.
