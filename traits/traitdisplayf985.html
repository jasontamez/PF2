Requirement(s) Dtang Ma
As you were born in Dtang Ma and possess one of the favored bloodlines, your sorcerous powers are particularly potent. Select one of the following sorcerer bloodlines: fey, maestro, starsoul, or stormborn. Once per day, you may use one of your bloodline powers as if your sorcerer level were 1 higher than normal. This trait does not give you access to bloodline powers whose level requirements you do not yet meet.
