You have an uncanny knack for turning equipment to new and unexpected uses. When using an item for anything other than its intended purpose'such as using a crowbar as a grappling hook or an old shirt to bandage a deadly wound-reduce the improvisation penalty by 2. This does not apply to improvised weapon penalties. Your GM may rule that some things are just not suitable for use in certain ways; for example, gluing a dead orc's face to your own face won't help you disguise yourself as an orc.
