The blood of outer dragons courses through your veins, and you've inherited a portion of their magic. You gain Draconic as a bonus language. In addition, if you are a sorcerer with the draconic bloodline, you can select one of the outer dragon types for your bloodline powers; this affects your resistances and the type of energy damage dealt by a number of your abilities.
