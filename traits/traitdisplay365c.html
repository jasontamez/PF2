Your fragile flesh shows signs of years not yet lived. Any creature trying to discern your true age must make a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by your Bluff check; you gain a +5 trait bonus on this check. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks if your disguise makes you look at least one age category older, and ignore the check penalty for disguising yourself as a different age category while doing so.
