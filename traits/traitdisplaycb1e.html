As a faithful adherent of Abadar, Desna, Erastil, Gozreh, Sarenrae, or Shelyn, you've come to the Swallowtail Festival to celebrate the consecration of Sandpoint Cathedral. You gain a silver holy symbol of your chosen deity, and so long as you worship that deity and openly wear his or her symbol, you regain +1 additional hit point every time you receive magical healing.
