The act of murder allows you to draw vitality from fleeing souls. Whenever you use a coup de grace action to kill a creature (either by damage or through a failed Fortitude save), you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half your character level (minimum 1) for 1 minute. These temporary hit points do not stack with multiple coups de grace.
