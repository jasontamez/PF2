As a pantheist, you are accustomed to calling on aid from a variety of sources, and have a pragmatic sense for how to best make use of any ally. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks made to request a favor from a creature that has not performed a favor for you in the past week. This bonus increases to +4 if you have performed a favor for that creature since it last did a favor for you.
