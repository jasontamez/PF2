You grew up listening to tales of a famed ancestor's mighty battles against giant foes. Just the mention of your ancestor's name is enough to strike fear into the heart of the most stalwart giant warrior, and you've resolved to follow in your forebear's footsteps. You take no penalty on Intimidate checks against creatures with the giant subtype that are larger than you, and you gain a +1 trait bonus to the DC of any fear-based effect you use against a creature with the giant subtype.
