You've never had the guts to act on it, but for as long as you can remember, You've had a crush on one of the NPCs. Someday, maybe you'll be able to earn the NPC's love, but for now, you're content to spend time in the NPC's proximity, or even to do things for the NPC that might earn you a word of thanks or a smile. Once per day, you may attempt to earn a kind word or a smile from the NPC whom you have a crush on by making a DC 15 Charisma check. If you're successful, the elation and joy at the attention gives you a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws for the remainder of the day. If you're ever lucky enough to win the NPC's love, this +1 trait bonus on saving throws applies at all times, as long as your relationship remains active. Note that gender isn't an issue in the case of these three NPCs. Unless your GM says otherwise, all three of these NPCs are considered to be bisexual as far as this trait's implications are concerned. Note that if you take this trait, you'll likely want to coordinate NPC choices with any other player who chooses this trait as well, since choosing the same NPC could cause unwanted party strife. Of course- if that's what you and the other player are looking for, go for it! In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your crush. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Sandru, Shalelu.
