You've trained with some of the best giantslayers out there, and have learned how to avoid the worst effects of a giant's powerful attacks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves. In addition, once per day, when a creature with the giant subtype successfully confirms a critical hit against you with a weapon or a slam attack (not a spell or special ability), you can roll with the attack. You take normal damage from the blow, as if the critical had not been confirmed. You must be aware of the attack and able to react to it-if you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC, you can't use this ability. If you are a dwarf or a gnome, you can use this ability twice per day.
