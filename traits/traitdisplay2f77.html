Category Drawback
When you were a child, a parent or
other person with authority over you made a minor pact
with a fiend on your behalf, stealing some of your vitality
in exchange for a minor boon. At the end of any combat,
you must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The DC is 10
+ the number of rounds you acted in combat. If you fail
this save, you become fatigued for 10 minutes per round
you acted during that encounter.
