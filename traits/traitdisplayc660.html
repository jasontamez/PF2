Though your magical studies were decades ago, you still remember your favorite little trick. Choose a 0-level arcane spell. You may cast that spell once per day as a spell-like ability. Your caster level is equal to your highest class level in a spellcasting class; if you have no caster level, it functions at CL 1st. The spell-like ability's save DC is Intelligence- or Charisma-based (chosen when you select this trait).
