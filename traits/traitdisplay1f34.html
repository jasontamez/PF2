Your ferocity is devastating,
sometimes even to your own weapons. Once per day, after
successful hitting a foe with a melee weapon, you can add
your Strength modifier to the damage roll a second time
(your Strength Modifier is not doubled if you are using a
two-handed weapon). Doing so has a 25% chance of giving
your weapon the broken condition.
