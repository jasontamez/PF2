For as long as you can remember, the spirits have always whispered into your ears and guided you-provided that you appease them. At the start of each day, you can choose one medium spirit (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 33-36) and accept one of its taboos for 24 hours. As long as you don't break that taboo, once during the next 24 hours, you can add a +1 trait bonus to any one roll, check, or saving throw (but not to AC) listed under your chosen spirit's spirit bonus. Using this ability is a free action that you can use even if it isn't your turn. If you are a medium, the spirit you choose with this trait must be the same as the spirit you are channeling and vice versa
