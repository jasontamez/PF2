You don't think of yourself as a gambler. In fact, you rather detest the whole thing. Unfortunately, one or more of your friends (pick one or more of the other players' characters) doesn't think so, and you've recently learned that friend-or friends-have decided to go to the Gold Goblin's "Cheat the Devil and Take his Gold" tournament. Which pretty much means you have to go as well, since if no one's there to watch out for them, they'll lose all their money and respect. Again. Sometimes it's hard being the responsible one. Your devotion to your friendships (even when said friends seem, at times, to be trying to test that devotion) is a point of pride to you. Whenever you take the Aid Another action to help an ally, or whenever an ally aids you in this manner, a successful check grants an additional +1 trait bonus to the check for which aid was being rendered. Additionally, as long as one of your friends is within 30 feet, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.
