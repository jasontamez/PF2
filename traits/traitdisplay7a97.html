Requirement(s) Razmiran
Priests of Razmiran often make subtle use of potions to hide the fact that they do not receive spells from their deity, and they have become quite adept at imbibing potions surreptitiously. You have mastered these techniques; whenever you consume a potion, you can attempt a Sleight of Hand check with a +2 trait bonus opposed by onlookers' Perception checks to hide the fact that you are drinking a potion (as if you were using Sleight of Hand to hide an object). The observer's success doesn't prevent you from drinking the potion, just from doing so unnoticed. This does not hide any visible effects that the potion might have on you, only the physical act of drinking the potion.
