You were taught from a young age that the world is full of big, fast, dangerous foes, and that sometimes the best course of action is to put your head down and run. Your parents taught you how to make the most of a solid mid-length sprint and how to squeeze just a little extra speed out of yourself. If you do nothing but move in a turn (that is, if you run or use both of your actions in a round to move your speed) and you are in no armor or light armor, you may move an extra 5 feet.
