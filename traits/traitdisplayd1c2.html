Never Stop Shooting

Category Basic (Combat)
Even when the chips are down,
you keep on shooting. If your hit point total drops to 0
or lower but you are not dead, you may act as if disabled
rather than dying (as if you possessed the Diehard feat).
However, you can use your actions only to draw a firearm,
reload a firearm, or attack with a firearm. If you have
the Diehard feat, this trait also allows you to substitute
your Wisdom score for your Constitution score for the
purpose of determining the negative hit point total at
which you die.
