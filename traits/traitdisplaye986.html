Requirement(s) Katapesh
You spent several years addicted to pesh, a habit that you may or may not have kicked. You start with only half of the normal starting cash, but your knowledge of the pesh lifestyle grants you a +1 trait bonus on Bluff, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive checks. One of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
