Hard to Kill

Your strong will to live and
spread good combined with your pure physicality makes
you a tough opponent to take down. You may have
discovered this as a child after a tragic accident or during
the course of your first battle. When you are attempting
a Constitution check to stabilize when dying, the penalty
on the check is only half your negative hit point total
instead of your full negative hit point total.
