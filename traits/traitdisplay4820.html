You inherited the statuesque physical features of your shaitan parent. Disguise becomes a class skill for you, and you gain a +2 trait bonus on Disguise checks to disguise yourself as a statue made of a specific type of stone, such as marble, sandstone, or alabaster. Furthermore, you take none of the penalties normally associated with disguising yourself as a different type of creature. You must choose the type of stone you resemble when you take this trait; once chosen, it cannot be changed.
