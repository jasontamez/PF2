Dwarves are well acquainted with the threats posed by giants and orcs, and they have spent centuries honing their techniques for fighting these foes. You have trained with the dwarves and have learned some of the tactics they use against their hated enemies. You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against creatures with the giant subtype (this does not stack with the bonus granted by the defensive training racial trait of dwarves and gnomes) and a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against creatures with the orc subtype (this does not stack with the bonus granted by the dwarf hatred racial trait). Dwarves and gnomes can't choose this trait.
