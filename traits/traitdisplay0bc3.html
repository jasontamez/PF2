You were guided to maturity by a trusted priest of an ecclesiastical tradition, who inspired you and made you understand that the authority exerted by a religious hierarchy is a blessing rather than a restriction, allowing the faithful to always feel confident in their direction and the righteousness of the guided actions. Now, your faith wells up whenever you are aided by divine magic, and you find it easy to open up to the magic and succor of any faith, seeing the similarities between all such traditions. Three times per day when you are the target of a harmless divine spell, you may increase its caster level by 1 for purposes of its effect on you alone.
