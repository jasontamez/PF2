Your perception that everyone is innately
good does not bode well in the heat of battle, when less
scrupulous foes might take advantage of your misguided
optimism. You take a -2 penalty to AC against attacks
with improvised weapons and a -2 penalty to CMD
against dirty trick combat maneuvers (see the Pathfinder
RPG Advanced Player's Guide).
