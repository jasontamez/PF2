Category Campaign
You've seen the horrors of war, and had hoped you-d seen the end of it. You've retreated from the fighting-likely from the front line with Molthune, but maybe from the crusade of Lastwall or the political infighting of Ustalav-and now just want to protect and provide for those you care about. You gain one of the following as a permanent class skill: Appraise, Heal, Knowledge (history), Sense Motive, or Survival. When you perform an aid another action to improve a creature's Armor Class, you increase its AC by +4 rather than +2.
