Requirement(s) Aasimar
Having been raised among other aasimars, you have a stronger connection to your planar heritage than most of your kind, and have more thoroughly explored your magical talent. You may expend your once per day spell-like ability to spontaneously cast cure light wounds (CL equal to your character level), but doing so is draining and you take an amount of nonlethal damage equal to half the number of hit points you heal.
