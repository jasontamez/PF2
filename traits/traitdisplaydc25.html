You find the pursuit of earning money to be a religious experience. Appraise is a class skill for you. So long as you are carrying coins worth an amount equal to at least 100 gp per character level you have, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves. This bonus increases to +2 against effects that would force you to discard, drop, or give away coins, gems, or trade goods in your possession.
