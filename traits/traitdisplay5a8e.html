When you had your deity's holy symbol tattooed on your body by a Sczarni tattooist years ago, you never imagined it would save your life. Your holy symbol tattoo functions in all ways as a holy symbol (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 57). When you use your holy symbol tattoo to keep a vampire at bay, the DC for the vampire to overcome its revulsion is 28 (rather than the normal 25).
