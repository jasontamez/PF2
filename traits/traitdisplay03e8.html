You can read a smattering of most languages and know enough to make pretty good guesses about the rest. Linguistics is a class skill for you, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Linguistic checks made for the purpose of deciphering writing in an unfamiliar language. You never draw a false conclusion if you fail your Linguistics check; instead, you simply realize you cannot make sense of the writing.
