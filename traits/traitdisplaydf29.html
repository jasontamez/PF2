You can't bring yourself to accept the authority of the gods, even though friends might hound you relentlessly to change your ways. Perhaps you're a Rahadoumi objecting on ideological grounds, or perhaps you just want to be left alone. Your doubt causes you to shrug off divine magic more quickly than others. Once per day when you are affected by a divine spell, you may reduce that spell's duration to half (minimum 1 round) for you alone.
