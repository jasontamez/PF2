You've been raised with tales of the great linnorms, and taught that the death curses of these vile dragons cannot stop the truly mighty. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saves to resist curses and spells with the curse descriptor and a +3 trait bonus on saves to resist curses originating from a linnorm.
