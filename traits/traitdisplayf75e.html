Winning at the tables in Riddleport's gambling houses can be as devastating as losing. Years of dodging the jealous blows of card table patrons have given you a sixth sense for when your luck is about to run out. Whenever you succeed at a Reflex saving throw, you may draw a weapon as an immediate action, or a hidden weapon as a move action.
