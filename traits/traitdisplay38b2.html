Requirement(s) Skinwalker-Werecrocodile-Kin
Once badly bitten by a stronger werecrocodile-kin, you learned the importance of showing your strength. Once per day, when you hit a flat-footed foe with a melee attack, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize that foe as a swift action. Intimidate becomes a class skill for you.
