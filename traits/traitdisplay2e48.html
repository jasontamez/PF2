Requirement(s) Plane of Air
Your years of piloting airships on the Plane of Air, dodging angry mephits and protecting your passengers from the depredations of capricious elementals, have taught you how to expertly command your vessel, as well as how to arrest yourself even in the midst of the most turbulent planar storms. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Wisdom checks to move in a plane with subjective directional gravity (see the planar rules in the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide) and a +2 trait bonus on driving checks (see the vehicle rules in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat).
