Category Basic (Faith)
As a child, you struggled to suppress a
sharp temper, but the care and patient respect of a trusted
community leader rubbed off on you.
As you grew older, you developed a
remarkable ability to keep calm
and collected when performing
a task you are familiar with.
Choose one Craft or Profession
skill. Whenever you take 10 with
that skill, determine the result
as if you had rolled a 12 instead
of a 10.

Suggested Characters: Asmodeans, Drumans, Irorans.
