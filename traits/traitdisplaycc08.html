You have the air of a person with money, allowing you to buy and sell valuables that otherwise are too rich for the local community. Once per week, when looking for an item with a price greater than the local community's base value (see page 461 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), make a DC 10 Diplomacy check; add 10 to the DC for each community size category between the current community and the community size with a base value sufficient for that item. Success means (with GM approval) you're able to sell or purchase that item as if the local community were of sufficient size. Each additional attempt (successful or otherwise) in that community increases the DC by an additional +10.

Example: If you're trying to find a +1 cloak of resistance (1,000 gp), you-d normally need to be in a small town (base value 1,000 gp) or larger to be able to find that item with little trouble. If you're currently in a hamlet, that's two community sizes away from a small town, so the Diplomacy DC is 30. If you went to a village and asked there, the DC would only be 20 because it's only one community size away from a small town.
