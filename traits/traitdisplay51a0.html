Your inhumanity extends to your very core. Pain receptors were omitted during your construction, so you gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against spells with the pain descriptor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 138). Additionally, once per day when you are healed by a spell that targets constructs (such as a make whole spell), you heal 1 extra hit point per level of the spell.
