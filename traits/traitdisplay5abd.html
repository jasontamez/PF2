You and your eidolon share a
link that seems to span multiple lifetimes. Your eidolon
treats its Constitution score as if it were 2 points higher
for the purposes of determining when its negative hit
point total sends it back to its home plane. In addition,
your eidolon gains a +1 trait bonus on Will saves against
enchantment spells and effects.
