Requirement(s) Rahadoum
Growing up in Rahadoum, you did not have access to clerics and other divine magic for healing, so you relied heavily on potions to cure your wounds. As a result, potions heal you more effectively. Whenever you consume a potion that heals any number of hit points, you heal 2 additional hit points.
