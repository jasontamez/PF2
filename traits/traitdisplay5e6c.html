Requirement(s) Andoletta
You were once faced with a grave injustice committed by an ignorant or delusional person, and righteous indignation moved you to correct the mistaken party. Once per day, when you confirm a critical hit against, successfully use a smite attack on, or use lay on hands on a creature that is affected by a charm or compulsion effect, you can invoke Andoletta to open the target's eyes. If the effect originally allowed a saving throw to resist it, the target can attempt a new saving throw against the charm or compulsion; if she's successful, the effect ends immediately.
