Requirement(s) Skinwalker-Wereshark-Kin
In your youth, you swam into the ocean as deep as you could, and had it not been for your wereshark ancestry you would have surely drowned. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Swim checks. As long as you have a swim speed (such as that granted by your bestial form), you can use the run action to move up to five times your swim speed while swimming straight down from or straight up toward the surface of the water.
