You have the symbol of an evil deity burned into your flesh. If the symbol is on your hand, you take a -1 penalty on Disable Device, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. If the symbol is on your face, you take a -2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks. This does not count as a holy symbol for the purposes of a divine focus for spellcasting.
