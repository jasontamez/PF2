Requirement(s) Must hail from Kyonin or have lived there for at least 1 year.
The elven druids of Kyonin taught you to commune with the natural healing powers of animals. Once per day when you cast a spell that restores hit points, you restore 1 additional hit point for every die rolled as long as a creature of the animal type is within 50 feet. You must decide to use this ability before rolling to determine the number of hit points that your spell restores.
