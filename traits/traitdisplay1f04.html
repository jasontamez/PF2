Requirement(s) Geb
As a resident of the undead lands of Geb, you know well that the walking dead often carry deadly poisons and diseases within them. You gain a +3 trait bonus on saving throws against disease and poison abilities and effects inflicted by creatures of the undead type (such as ghoul fever or a vargouille's poison).
