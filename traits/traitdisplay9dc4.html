Nethys Note: this is a special trait that can only be gained by progressing through the Hell's Vengeance Adventure Path. It is not available for normal character creation

You have sworn your body to Queen Abrogail and House Thrune in a ritual ceremony, and are willing to lay down your life in service to Thrune. Once per week, when reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, you automatically gain fast healing 1 for 1 minute. Once this ability has been used, you instead gain a +4 trait bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when reduced to negative hit points.

In addition, you receive an invisible <a href="spelldisplay6cc8.html?ItemName=arcane%20mark">arcane mark</a> of the encircled cross emblem of Cheliax as a symbol of your loyalty. This mark does not fade and is visible only to other creatures with this trait, or creatures with the ability to perceive the invisible (via <a href="spelldisplaybdc5.html?ItemName=see%20invisibility"></a> or <a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a>, for example). You can make this mark visible to other creatures for 1 round as a swift action. If the mark is dispelled or removed (such as with <a href="spelldisplay505d-2.html?ItemName=erase">erase</a>), it can be replaced with another casting of <a href="spelldisplay6cc8.html?ItemName=arcane%20mark">arcane mark</a>, which thereafter functions as detailed in this trait.
