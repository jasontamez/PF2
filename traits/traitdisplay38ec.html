Your first thought upon awaking in the asylum isn't confusion over why you can't remember anything clearly-it's a sudden urge to find safety. You feel like everything around you, aside from your companions, might threaten you and you're always ready to react. You have a hard time staying still, and you're constantly surveying your surroundings. Maybe you are paranoid, or maybe it's just an overactive imagination, but whatever it is, you know that keeping these feelings honed will help you stay alive.

You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks and a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves.
