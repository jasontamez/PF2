You've always been fascinated with the ancient race of sphinxes, and are inspired by them to love puzzles and riddles and enjoy solving difficult dilemmas. Like so many others, You've come to Wati to explore its ancient necropolis, but You've also heard that sphinxes occasionally visit a sphinx-shaped ruin called Ubet's Folly in the city-perhaps you'll have the chance to meet and talk with a sphinx yourself! You gain a +1 trait bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against sphinxes, and a +1 trait bonus on any skill check to decipher a puzzle or riddle. In addition, you may choose Sphinx as one of your bonus languages.
