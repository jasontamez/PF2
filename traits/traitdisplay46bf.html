Category Drawback
In your youth, you saw a younger
friend or loved one suffer a grievous injury or die, and
you blamed yourself for not having been there to help,
even if there was nothing you could have done. If one
of your allies should fall unconscious from hit point
damage, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and skill
checks as long as you are farther than 10 feet away from
your fallen ally.
