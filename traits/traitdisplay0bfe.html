Category Drawback
You were enslaved for part or all of
your youth, and marked as such with a brand or tattoo
that still reminds you of how you were punished whenever
you failed to do what you should. Whenever you fail a skill
check, you take a -2 penalty on any skill check or attack
roll you attempt before the end of your next turn unless it
is a part of retrying the failed skill check.
