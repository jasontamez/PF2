Requirement(s) Nex
Since you were young, you've always been interested in the process of lichdom and what drives people to desire such a fate. Nexian officials marked you as a traitor and exiled you when they discovered your morbid fascination with the consummate undead, but you still benefit from your forbidden studies. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and (religion) checks. In addition, choose one Knowledge skill; you can attempt untrained checks with this skill as long as the DC is lower than 15.
