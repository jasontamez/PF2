You are adept at escaping from confinement in an unobtrusive manner. When trying to escape manacles, rope, or other similar restraints (but not grapples or similar attacks), you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of your Escape Artist modifier. If you free yourself, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to pretend that you are still bound.
