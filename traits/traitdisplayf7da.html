Your faith in magic allows you to
ref lexively use the energy of any spell effect currently on you
to save you from death. As long as you are under the effects
of a spell, you gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against
death effects. If you are reduced to negative hit points while
you are under the effects of any spell, you automatically
confirm stabilization checks to stop bleeding.
