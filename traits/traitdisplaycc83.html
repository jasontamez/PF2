Category Drawback
You were reported to a dangerous authority such as the Gray Gardeners of Galt, the high inquisitors of Cheliax, or the Council of Mwanyisa of Mzali, and narrowly escaped death. You second-guess your instincts constantly, leaving you never sure whether or not to trust someone and endangered if you encounter that group's agents again. You can roll twice and take the lower result on Sense Motive checks to get hunches. You cannot reroll this result, even if you have another ability that would normally allow you to do so.
