You belong to a noble family that matters in Taldor, though as the story begins you may or may not be on good terms with your relatives. Your upbringing among the city's well-to-do gives you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With Princess Eutropia's efforts to provide for Taldor's common citizens and overturn years of tradition, new lines are being quietly drawn in the sand, and you have found yourself embroiled in these intrigues whether you intended to be or not.

With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in Aroden's View or Senate's Hill. If you want to be a member of one of Oppara's major noble families, you must take the <a href="featdisplay02f9.html?ItemName=Noble%20Scion%20(Taldor%20Variant)">Noble Scion</a> feat at 1st level.

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Knowledge (nobility) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. The Noble Scion feat (see the sidebar) does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. In addition, you start play with a <a href="equipmentmiscdisplayd782.html?ItemName=Noble's%20Outfit">noble's outfit</a>, a <a href="equipmentmiscdisplayce2c.html?ItemName=Signet%20Ring">signet ring</a>, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp.
