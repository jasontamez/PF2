You've failed the trials to gain entry to one of the Houses of Perfection. Though you are disappointed, you were able to pick up one trick from the monks. Choose a single combat maneuver. Once per day, you can perform that combat maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity, and you gain a +2 bonus on that attempt.
