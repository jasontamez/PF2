Category Campaign
You were born and raised in the town of Longacre on the southwestern fringes of the Whisperwood, or at least have lived there long enough that you're considered a native. You've never been one for the quiet life, and have been considered a miscreant and reprobate since you were a child. As an adult, You've made something of a name for yourself as a thug, enforcer, and petty thief in town, hiring yourself out to anybody who needs muscle in exchange for a few coins. In the course of such employment, You've worked with another local troublemaker named Cimri Staelish and have become friends. Cimri has recently gotten involved with some shadowy, though powerful, characters, and as Hell's Vengeance begins, you and a group of other ne-erdo- wells have agreed to help Cimri burgle a tannery just outside town. With luck, this could be the start of bigger and better things than just working as hired muscle. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate checks, and Intimidate is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon damage rolls when you are flanking a foe with an ally.
