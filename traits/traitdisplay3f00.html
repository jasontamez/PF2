Your exposure to eldritch phenomena has caused your skin to develop a strange pattern. Once per day as you cast a spell whose casting time is 1 round or less, you can roll 1d4-2 (no minimum) and add the result to that spell's effective caster level. In an area of primal magic, the minimum result of this roll is 0, not -1.
