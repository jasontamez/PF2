Requirement(s) Orc
You were exposed to vision-granting caustic vapors by the oracles of the Brimstone Haruspex, whether because you had a pressing question or because a parent or chieftain considered you an expendable proxy. The vapors left scars that impose a -1 penalty on Charismabased checks, but once per day you gain a flash of insight that allows you to roll twice on a Knowledge skill check or Intelligence check and take the better result. You must choose to use this trait before rolling.
