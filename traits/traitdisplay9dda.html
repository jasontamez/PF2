You never felt like you belonged in your family. You were different, an outsider, and you grew up unable to bond with the people around you. Now, as an adult, you are still a little odd and others have a hard time understanding what makes you tick. You receive a +1 trait bonus on saving throws made to resist charm and compulsion effects.
