You awake with a sense of purpose and a tingle of magical power. Though it's unsettling that you can't recall your past, you have a hunch that if you and your companions do everything just right-follow the correct steps and order-the answers will reveal themselves and you will be free of your condition. You get the feeling that you've always fallen back on careful planning and time-tested evidence in the past, but a nagging sensation also tells you that you used these skills in less-than-kind ways all too recently.

Choose one 0-level spell. You can cast this spell once per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. In addition, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all skill checks when performing occult rituals.
