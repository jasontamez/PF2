You are helpful and hardworking. When you successfully use the aid another action to aid an ally's Craft or Profession check, that character gains an additional +1 trait bonus on the check (in addition to the +2 bonus normally granted for successfully aiding another). If you have a racial bonus on that skill, your ally gains a +2 trait bonus instead.
