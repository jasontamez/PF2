Tales of the Knights of Ozem have inspired you since childhood to lash out reflexively against the undead. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls when making attacks of opportunity against undead. While you wield a shield, your shield bonus to AC improves by 1 against attacks of opportunity made by undead.
