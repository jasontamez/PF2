Requirement(s) Osirion
You were raised near the infamous necropolis of Wati, and even managed to sneak into these hallowed grounds on occasion. Entering the clergy of the Voices of the Spire in Wati was a natural choice as you grew older, and your past experiences made you a particularly well-informed disciple of the church. Your effective cleric level is 1 higher for the purposes of channeling positive energy to damage undead. Your effective cleric level cannot exceed your character level.
