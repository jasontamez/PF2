You pray to whatever local deity will answer your prayers-and if they won't, to hell with them. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks and can make Knowledge (religion) checks as if trained. Once per day, you can cast resistance on yourself as a spell-like ability cast at your highest caster level (CL 1st if you have no caster level).
