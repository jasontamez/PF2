Select one terrain type from the ranger's favored terrain list. While in this terrain type, taking a standard action while disabled does not cause you to take the normal 1 point of damage. You can use this trait when acting as if disabled despite having a negative hit point total as a result of orc ferocity or the Diehard feat.
