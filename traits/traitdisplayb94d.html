Requirement(s) Halfling
Your parents allowed escaping slaves to
hide in your home, and the stories you've heard from them
instilled into you a deep loathing of slavery. You gain a +1
trait bonus on any skill check or attack roll made during
the process of escaping capture or in helping a slave escape
bondage, and Escape Artist is always a class skill for you.
