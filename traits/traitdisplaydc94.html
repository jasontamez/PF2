You grew up in or near an opulent, decadent  culture that valued nothing more than showing up the  material wealth or accomplishments of others, causing the  seed of envy to be planted in your heart. For each day you  spend without stealing at least 10 gp worth of valuables or  other wealth, attempt a DC 20 Will save. If you fail, you  take a cumulative -1 penalty on Will and Reflex saving  throws and concentration checks (up to a -5 penalty). If you  succeed, the penalty is reset to 0.
