When you were young, your parents presented you to the oracles of Po Li, claiming a divine sign showed you were the reincarnation of Lung Wa's Eternal Emperor. The oracles did not support the claim, but you are not untouched by celestial influence. You may use Knowledge (nobility) or Knowledge (religion) in place of Knowledge (planes) to identify outsiders, and nonevil outsiders you encounter begin with an attitude that is one step better than normal.
