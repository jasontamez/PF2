Although you're a relative newcomer to Magnimar, you're not some naive stranger. You've been sent by the Pathfinder Society lodge in your home country to learn more about Varisia by experiencing the frontier firsthand. After arriving, you reported to the Magnimar lodge and placed your expertise at the venture-captain's disposal. To represent your experience in distant lands, choose a country other than Varisia as your homeland and gain one of the languages spoken in that country as a bonus language (see The Inner Sea World Guide). Additionally, choose one of the following skills: Handle Animal, Knowledge (geography), Linguistics, or Survival. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks made with this skill and it is always a class skill for you.
