Requirement(s) Irrisen
You have learned to incorporate fey enchantments into your hexes to snare victims that shake off your curses. Once per day as a free action, when a creature succeeds at its saving throw against your hex that cannot target the same creature more than once per day, you can declare that creature to be subject to your fey hex. You can attempt the failed hex against the creature a second time, so long as you do so within 1 minute.
