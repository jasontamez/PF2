You were bullied often as a child, and you are
now constantly ready to defend yourself with your fists
when an enemy comes near. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
attack of opportunity attack rolls made with unarmed
strikes. Note that this trait does not grant the ability to
make attacks of opportunity with your unarmed strikes'
you must have a level in monk, the Improved Unarmed
Strike feat, or some other similar power to gain the use
of this character trait. However, that doesn't prevent you
from selecting this trait. You simply cannot make use of
it until a later point if you do.
