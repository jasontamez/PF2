The rocky foothills of your homeland are ideal for staging leaping ambushes that leave your victims battered and routed. You gain a +1 trait bonus on melee damage rolls when you make a charge attack from higher ground. Once per day, when you make a charge attack from higher ground, you can use the Intimidate skill to demoralize your target as a swift action.
