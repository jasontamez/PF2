group of devoted companions thanks to your impressive
talent, and the experience inspired in you a powerful selfassurance
and air of superiority. Your confidence is so
strong that others feel naturally compelled to follow your
commands. Choose one 1st-level enchantment spell you
are capable of casting. The DC of that spell increases by 1.
