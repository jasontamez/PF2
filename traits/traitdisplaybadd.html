In emulation of the empyreal lord's intensely channeled rage, you are an inspiration on the battlefield. Once per day, when you attack a foe who injured you during the same combat, you can inspire allies who can see you as a move action. Each other ally within 30 feet who can see you gains a +2 morale bonus on her next attack roll.
