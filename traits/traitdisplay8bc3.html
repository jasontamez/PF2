You grew up in a tranquil, happy home near the mountains, but that peace was shattered when giants came down from the mountains to raid your settlement. The giants killed your parents and left you a young orphan, and since that day, you've sworn to avenge the deaths of your kin. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against creatures with the giant subtype, and a +2 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits against creatures with the giant subtype.
