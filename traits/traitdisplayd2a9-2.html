Category Campaign
You recently hired on to Sandru's caravan to serve as a guard, but the job, while it paid well, gave you little chance to scratch the adventuring itch, since the caravan never really ventured into dangerous territory. You understand why Sandru avoided the more dangerous routes, of course, but that didn't help assuage your urge to seek adventure. You've just told Sandru that you're quitting the job in order to try your hand at adventuring- he seemed to understand, and even gave you some good tips on how best to survive potential challenges. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks, and Survival becomes a class skill for you. NPC Choices: Sandru.
