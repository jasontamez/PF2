You've studied the speeches and writings of a leader or thinker who served as a reassuring voice in her community in the turbulent times after Aroden died, painfully learning which portions of Aroden's advice no longer applied and what of his writings could still be usefully applied. Once per day, you can speak Aroden's words of encouragement to grant any human a +1 insight bonus on any attack roll, saving throw, or skill check of his choice within the following hour. The choice to use the insight bonus must be made before the related roll is made.
