You are an expert hunter among your tribe. Whenever you throw a club, shortspear, spear, or javelin, reduce the penalty for throwing the weapon beyond its initial range increment by 2 (to a minimum penalty of 0). For example, a club (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target 25 feet away would incur only a -2 penalty with this trait.
