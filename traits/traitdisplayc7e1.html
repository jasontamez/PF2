Requirement(s) Dwarf
Your family brought the secrets of
dwarven brewing to non-dwarven lands. Though this
has given you skill in the brewer's craft, it's also earned
you distrust among dwarven purists. You gain a +1 trait
bonus on Profession (brewer) and Craft (alchemy) checks,
but you take a -1 penalty on Diplomacy checks made to
change the attitude of dwarves who know that your family
has shared brewing secrets with non-dwarves.
