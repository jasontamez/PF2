Requirement(s) Numeria
You managed to uncover some lesser secrets of the Technic League, and have mastered a minor bit of magic. Choose a 0-level spell. You may cast that spell once per day as a spell-like ability. This is cast at your highest caster level gained; if you have no caster level, it functions at CL 1st.
