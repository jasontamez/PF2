Category Basic (Faith)
You may have been
raised in a devout family, studied the divine
in a formal church environment, or even
learned how to combine traditional healing
techniques with those of divine casters. In so doing,
you have focused yourself into being the perfect
vessel for your deity. Divine power flows through you
like a mountain stream, making your healing touch more
potent than that of others. You heal 1 additional point of damage when using lay on hands, channeling energy, or
casting a cure spell.
