You grew up and were raised around
fabulous sporting events, and your youth was consumed
with a driving need to be better than everyone else. Any
hint of a contest spurs you to your greatest heights of
potential. Whenever another creature within 30 feet
attempts a skill check and you attempt a check with the
same skill before the start of that creature's next turn,
you gain a +1 trait bonus on your check (this includes
attempting an opposed skill check against the creature).

Suggested Characters: Brevans, Kurgess worshipers,
Sargavans.
