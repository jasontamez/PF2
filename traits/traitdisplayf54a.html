Drawing inspiration from the Cult of the Failed, you refuse to let setbacks stop you, no matter how disastrous. Once per day when you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check, you gain a +1 trait bonus on any one roll you attempt before the end of the next round.
