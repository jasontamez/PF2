Requirement(s) City of Brass
While enslaved in the City of Brass, you watched too many of your friends fall victim to efreet tempers. Now, you help others avoid thorny situations whenever you are able. Any time you successfully use the aid another action to help an ally succeed at a Bluff or Escape Artist check, you add a +3 bonus to this check (rather than a +2 bonus).
