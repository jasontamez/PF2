Requirement(s) The Shackles
You were captured by kuru cannibals and nearly devoured in a sacrificial ritual. At the last second you wriggled free from your bonds and escaped into the jungle. Your narrow escape has left you with a paranoid fear of capture. You secretly conduct regular sessions in which you slip out of different types of knots. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Escape Artist checks, and Escape Artist becomes a class skill for you.
