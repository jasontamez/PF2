You are a member of the Shoanti or Varisian ethnicity who left your people to learn more about the mysteries of your strange homeland. Your travels have recently brought you to the Pathfinder lodge in Magnimar. Although none of your family members are present, you carry them and your family traditions with you.

If you are a Varisian, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks made relating to Varisia and gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls made during the surprise round when you're wielding a bladed scarf or starknife.

If you are a Shoanti, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Survival checks made while in Varisia and gain a +1 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits made using an earth breaker or a klar.
