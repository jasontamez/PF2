Though the ghouls of Nemret Noktoria and the drow of Zirnakaynin seldom darken the surface of Golarion, both have pacts with influential slavers and warlords who periodically provide the demon worshipers with kidnapped slaves. You were once one of these unfortunate victims and were destined to become a sacrifice to a dreadful demon lord, but you managed to slip your bonds and escape back to the surface. The horrors you witnessed were beyond fathoming, and though visions of imprisoned loved ones and friends plague your dreams, you are stronger for the experience. You gain a +1 trait bonus on saves against fear effects and gain low-light vision 10 feet. If you already have low-light vision, its range extends by 10 feet.
