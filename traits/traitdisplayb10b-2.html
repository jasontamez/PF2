Requirement(s) Ustalav
Leaving Graidmere Swamp is
forbidden, and to flee the mire is to court Seryzilian's wrath.
However, you are one of the few to successfully make it out of
the swamp alive. Now, you're resolved to liberate your kinfolk.
You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks to find fresh water,
and magical liquids in your possession gain a +2 bonus on
Will saves to avoid being corrupted or otherwise spoiled.
