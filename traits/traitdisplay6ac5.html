Category Drawback
You were born in a place with a plethora of strangely interacting magic, such as Geb, the Mana Wastes, or Nex, and magic is dangerously eager to surge into action around you. You roll twice and take the lower result on Use Magic Device checks to activate items blindly and on Reflex saving throws against effects produced by magic items.
