Requirement(s) [Elf] Calistria
Your association with Calistria's church has toughened your flesh against venom and blessed you with the ability to influence wasps and similar insectile vermin. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws against poison. You may make Diplomacy checks (or wild empathy checks if you are a druid or ranger) to improve a Hostile or Unfriendly insectile vermin's attitude toward Indifferent.
