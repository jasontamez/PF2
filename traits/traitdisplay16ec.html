Your superiors have identified you as an Eagle Knight candidate, and their praise encourages you to strive to meet their expectations. Each day after getting a full night's sleep, you gain a +1 trait bonus to your AC when wearing armor or carrying a shield. This bonus lasts until you are first hit by an attack within the next 24 hours.
