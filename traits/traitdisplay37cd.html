Category Campaign
You awake feeling emboldened after a terrifying nightmare. Instead of being frightened by the bizarre creatures from your nightmares, these experiences have steeled you against these startling alien beings. You know that you fell victim to strange circumstances and loathsome forces, but you refuse to give in to a creeping sense of helplessness. Instead, you vow to fight back against whoever or whatever is responsible for your current situation. The creatures of your nightmares won't hold fear over your head. You'll take the fight to them.

You gain a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against extraordinary, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of aberrations (for example, a <a href="monsterdisplay0218.html?ItemName=Gibbering%20Mouther">gibbering mouther's gibbering</a> or an <a href="monsterdisplay6855.html?ItemName=Intellect%20Devourer">intellect devourer's confusion</a>). In addition, whenever you're confused and roll to determine behavior in a given round, subtract 10 from the result.
