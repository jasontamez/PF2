You were, or are, possessed in some way by
another entity that grants you occasional access to its
knowledge. Once per day, you can attempt a Knowledge
check of your choice even if you are not trained in
that skill and it is not usually possible to use that skill
untrained. If you can normally use that skill untrained,
you gain a +2 trait bonus on the check.
