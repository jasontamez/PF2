The family's honor is tied to a shared goal binding you all together. With the aid of the GM, choose a task that your family is bound to accomplish. Once per day, when you are within 60 feet of another character with this trait, you can gain a +1 trait bonus on a single saving throw or skill check when progress toward the goal is directly at stake (at the GM's discretion).
