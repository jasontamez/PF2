Requirement(s) Iomedae
From an early age, you were
trained by a militaristic order of clerics. You are devoted to
the teachings of Iomedae and to spreading those teachings
by force. Whenever you cast a divine spell that affects any
melee weapons, choose one of those weapons; it gains a +1
trait bonus on damage rolls for the duration of the spell.
