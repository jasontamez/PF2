Your dreams are a special place of power that only you get to enjoy; driving away threats to your subconscious is as easy as slamming a door. You receive a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks and a +2 trait bonus on Will saves against effects on your dreaming mind or subconscious, such as a night hag's dream haunting ability, the nightmare spell, and illusions of the phantasm subschool.
