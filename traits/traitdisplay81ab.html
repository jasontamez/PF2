Corporeal Warrior Package

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btq01vab">Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 10</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9q01?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Adventurers-Armory-2">Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 4 </a>
The daring bravo is equally adept in social situations and combat, with the right equipment to move fluidly from one to the other. Such adventurers are known as much for their flair and panache as their martial prowess, and the daring bravo's equipment is often ornately ornamented or personalized. This equipment package is good for a bard, fighter, rogue, swashbuckler, or vigilante. Certain cavaliers, investigators, skalds, or even paladins may also find it appealing. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.

The holy warrior is prepared to use her might and zeal to take the fight to the enemy, but she understands the importance of having the right equipment to overcome the resistances of her monstrous foes. This equipment package is well-suited to a cleric, inquisitor, paladin, warpriest, or even a fighter with a religious background. It's especially suited to characters who focus on supporting their party members and making them more effective in a fight. Even more than with other equipment packages, the GM should consider substituting the masterwork longsword in this package with a masterwork melee weapon appropriate to the PC's faith. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.

The lore seeker has the equipment necessary to delve into ancient ruins searching for lost knowledge.

If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch and a holy symbol (if required).
Weapons: Light crossbow with 10 bolts, quarterstaff, silver dagger.
