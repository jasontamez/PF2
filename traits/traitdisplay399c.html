Others may call it junk, but you call it a bargain. You can buy objects with the broken condition at half price (instead of the normal three-quarters price). The value of the unbroken version of these objects cannot exceed four times your character level. The price you pay for this object can never exceed more than twice your character level in gp (for example, at 5th level you can spend up to 10 gp on a broken object, meaning you can buy any object that, if not broken, has a value of 20 gp or less).
