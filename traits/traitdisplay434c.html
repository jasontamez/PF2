You catch others off-guard when a confrontation escalates. As long as you are standing in or adjacent to water, or holding at least a pint of liquid (including insoluble liquids like oil or alchemist's fire), you can perform a dirty trick combat maneuver to blind a foe within reach without provoking an attack of opportunity. If you select the Improved Dirty Trick feat, you gain a +2 trait bonus on dirty trick combat maneuvers to blind foes as long as you are standing in or adjacent to water or holding a pint of liquid.
