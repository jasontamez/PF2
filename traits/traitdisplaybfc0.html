Category Basic (Faith)
You venerate nature, either by paying homage to your Shoanti totem spirit or by appeasing the kami around you in accordance with Tamashigo. In return, the spirits bless your path. Once per week, you can build a small shrine of natural materials and pay your respects in a ritual that takes 15 minutes. Spellcasters can do this as part of their daily spell preparation. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks for 24 hours.
