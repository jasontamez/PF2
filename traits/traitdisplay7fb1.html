Your years spent in libraries reading every musty tome you could find about the ancient lost civilization of Azlant have given you insight into the subjects of history and the arcane. You gain a +1 trait bonus to Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) checks. One of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.
