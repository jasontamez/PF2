You strive to spread the Dawnflower's message of kindness and compassion throughout the land, no matter how dangerous the road may be. Whenever you use channel energy, fervor, or lay on hands to heal a living creature, you can reroll any healing die roll that results in a natural 1 (you must use the new result).
