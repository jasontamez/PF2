Category Campaign
You are best friends with one of the NPCs; you've grown up together, and while your friend has had a much more exciting life than you so far, you hope one day to follow in your friend's footsteps and see the world-or perhaps even become an adventurer yourself. you've picked up a lot from your friend, but particularly his or her skill in interacting with others. If Ameiko is your best friend, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks. If Sandru is your best friend, you gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks. Whichever skill you gain a trait bonus on, that skill is always considered a class skill for you. In addition, in situations where your best friend is in danger, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your friend. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Sandru.
