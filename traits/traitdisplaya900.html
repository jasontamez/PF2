You consider mischief a sacred rite in humbling enemies. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when performing a dirty trick combat maneuver while your smite evil bonus applies to combat maneuver checks. If you already do not provoke such attacks of opportunity (such as by having Improved Dirty Trick), you instead gain a +2 trait bonus on dirty trick combat maneuver checks against creatures that are the targets of your smite.
