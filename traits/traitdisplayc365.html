Requirement(s) Android
Whenever you are affected by a polymorph spell or effect, your nanites adjust completely at a molecular level. For the duration of the polymorph effect, you are treated as only a humanoid for the purpose of effects that target creatures by type. For example, a ranger's favored enemy bonus against constructs wouldn't apply to you while you are polymorphed, but nor would spells such as make whole. This trait modifies part of the android's constructed racial trait, but otherwise that trait is unchanged (a polymorphed android still can't gain morale bonuses, is still immune to fear, and so on).
