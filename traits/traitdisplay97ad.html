You inspire slaves to fight for freedom with a rousing battle cry. As a standard action, you may make a rallying cry with a DC 15 Perform (oratory) check. On a successful check, any unarmed ally within 30 feet who is able to hear you gains a +2 trait bonus on attack rolls with improvised weapons and unarmed strikes. This bonus lasts for 1 round per level.
