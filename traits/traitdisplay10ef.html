You have an unearthly appearance and soothing aura about you that make people believe you are gifted with divine powers. You learned at a young age to make use of your gift in order to make money, and you've found ways to ethically justify your work. You can make a Heal check weekly to earn money as though making a Profession check. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Heal checks.
