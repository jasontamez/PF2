Your birth came at a time when the sun was auspiciously aligned with your birth sign. As a result, you have a natural affinity for light and life. Whenever you're affected by a healing effect that would heal more hit points than your maximum hit point total, you gain the excess healing as temporary hit points. You can gain up to a number of temporary hit points per day equal to your character level in this way. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.
