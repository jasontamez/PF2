Requirement(s) Katapesh
Growing up in the vast markets of Katapesh, you developed connections to a great many alchemists and poisoners all over the world. You know many of the right people in any given locale as well as how to get in touch with useful contacts. When determining whether a given potion is available in a settlement, there is a 90% chance that it is available if it is within the settlement's base value for available magic items rather than a 75% chance. Additionally, when you use Diplomacy to gather information about a topic related to alchemy or poisons (including making poisons), you gain a +3 trait bonus on the check.
