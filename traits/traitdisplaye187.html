Requirement(s) Lung Wa
You fight at your best in martial arts tournaments, such as those once popular in Lung Wa and still common in Quain. While others may attempt to cheat or chafe against the constraints placed upon them, you thrive under such limitations. You gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls when fighting as part of a tournament or other structured setting with rules and restrictions, so long as you do not break these rules.
