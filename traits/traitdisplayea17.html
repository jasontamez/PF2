Your deity or a powerful spirit spoke to you
when you were young, dropping cryptic hints about the
important destiny that lay before you and how you must
win your fights if you are to achieve your predetermined
greatness. Once per day upon rolling a natural 1 on an
attack roll, you may reroll the die and take the second
result instead.

Suggested Characters: Oracles, paladins, Ulfen.
