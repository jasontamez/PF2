Requirement(s) Osirion
Having studied the sciences and other formal academics in your formative years, you swiftly became interested in the esoteric numerological practices of the ancient Osirian mathematicians, and know how to apply this science to dungeons. Once per day, you can attempt a Perception check while studying a trap (a standard action). The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC of the trap - 5. If you succeed, you identify the DC necessary to disable the trap, as well as the DC of the Reflex save (if any) to avoid its effects.
