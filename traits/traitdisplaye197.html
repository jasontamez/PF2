Requirement(s) The Worldwound
You have studied techniques designed to pierce magical protections, with the goal of assisting your Abyssal masters in bringing down the wardstones that guard the borders of Mendev. Once per day, you can attempt a melee touch attack against an opponent that you believe has a deflection bonus to AC. If your attack is successful, your foe's deflection bonus to AC is halved (to a minimum of +0) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability twice per day at 10th level and three times per day at 20th level.
