Requirement(s) Belkzen
The orcs of Belkzen routinely mix the blood of their enemies with potions they brew to gain some of their foe's strength. Twice per day when you brew a potion, you can add some of an enemy's blood to the mixture. When you do, the potion's caster level is treated as 1 higher when you drink it for the purpose of determining the duration of the potion's effects. This ability has no effect if another creature drinks the potion. This trait does not grant the ability to brew potions.
