Not all passengers on seafaring vessels are legal or even known to the captain and crew, and the Jenivere is no exception. Whether too poor to book legal passage on the ship or fearing discovery by customs officials in your home port, you or an ally stowed away on the ship in secret. This may mean that the crew doesn't know you're on board, or perhaps they do now but didn't when the ship set sail. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks and Survival checks to find food.

Characters with this trait might have boarded the Jenivere at any port, but especially in the cities of the Shackles.
