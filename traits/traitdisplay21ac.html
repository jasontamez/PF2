Requirement(s) Darklands
Growing up in a dangerous area,
you were constantly surrounded by traps that had been set
up to defend your lair from intruders. Sometimes these
dangers were so densely packed that you couldn't go more
than a couple feet down a tunnel without encountering a
new way to die. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Craft (traps)
checks, and gain a +1 bonus to AC against attacks by traps or
on saving throws against effects created by traps.
