Everyone in town seems to admire Ameiko and Shalelu-they're heroes, after all, and played key roles in the recent troubles that plagued Sandpoint. You, though, take this admiration to a new level-you practically worship one of these two. This could be because you saw one of them perform a particularly impressive act of bravery at some point in the past, or maybe they just happened to give you the exact right words of encouragement or a kind gift at some point a few years ago when you were young and impressionable. In any case, they've done your best to emulate your hero's talents at spellcasting or combat. If your hero is Ameiko, you gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks. If your hero is Shalelu, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC against attacks of opportunity. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your hero. NPC Choices: Ameiko, Shalelu.
