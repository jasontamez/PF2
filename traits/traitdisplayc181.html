You are able to divorce your knowledge of the facts from your beliefs about the truth, and thus from your facial expressions and body language. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Bluff checks to lie, provided the person you're lying to has never known you to lie to him. Failing this check counts as being caught in a lie by the target, negating any future use of this bonus against that person.
