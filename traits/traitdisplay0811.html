Requirement(s) Gnome
You have a small, bizarre collection of apparently worthless items, such as rusty nails, animal droppings, clockwork cogs, or bent spoons. You find this strange menagerie useful in ways no non-gnome could understand. Seeking new items to add to this collection is endlessly fascinating to you, and while no one else may understand why a Chelish horsenail is worthy to add to your collection when a dwarven wheelbarrow nail is not, it all makes sense to you. Select one of the following skills: Craft (any one), Disable Device, Escape Artist, Perform (any one), or Spellcraft. Whenever you have your collection within 5 feet of you, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all checks made with the selected skill. Once this skill has been selected, it cannot be changed, nor can you gain it for any other collection you begin amassing.
