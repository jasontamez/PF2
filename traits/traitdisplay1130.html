Requirement(s) Katapesh [Ifrit]
The slavers of Katapesh were determined to sell you as living property, but you had other plans. You know not whether your slavers hunt you still, but you are careful about whom you trust and you always sleep with one eye open. You need to sleep only 4 hours to get a full night's rest (restoring 1 hit point per character level). You do not receive extra benefits for sleeping additional hours, and you must still rest for 24 hours to receive the benefits of complete bed rest.
