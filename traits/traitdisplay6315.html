Category Basic (Magic)
The union between spirits and spiritualists is one of the strongest (and strangest) bonds shared between the mortal realm and the spirit world. Spiritualists can use the knowledge of their linked phantoms to better negotiate with other spirits. Whether you're a spiritualist or not, you've always had a similar knack when it comes to interactions with the spirit world. You gain a +4 trait bonus on checks to notice haunts,  and when interacting with someone who is possessed by an incorporeal undead creature, you gain a +2 trait bonus n Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against that target.
