Category Basic (Faith)
You were born with a strange birthmark
that looks very similar to the holy symbol of the god you
chose to worship later in life. This birthmark can serve
you as a divine focus for casting spells, and as a physical
manifestation of your faith, and it increases your devotion
to your god. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws
against charm and compulsion effects.
