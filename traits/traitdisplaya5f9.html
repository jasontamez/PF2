Requirement(s) Kobold
Your distinctive golden scales strongly
ref lect the light, making other kobolds mistrust
you, but aboveground races favor you. You take a -1
penalty on Bluff checks and Diplomacy checks when
dealing with other kobolds, but a +2 bonus on Bluff
checks and Diplomacy checks when dealing with
non-reptilian humanoids.
