You've come (or been sent) to Riddleport to observe the strange Blot that has appeared in the city's sky. You've decided to put your keen senses to the test at the Golden Goblin's upcoming gambling competition while you're here. Your sharp eyesight makes it easier for you to notice things at a distance. For you, Perception checks only start increasing in difficulty at a range of 20 feet or farther, as opposed to the normal 10. This has no effect on checks made to perceive things within 10 feet.
