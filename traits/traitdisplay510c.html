You were part of a group that was mercilessly attacked by giants of the tundra, who may have gone so far as to eat the dead and dying. After that, little can faze you, but you strongly prefer to finish fights with giants quickly to prevent anything like that from happening again. You gain a +2 trait bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits against giants and on saving throws against fear effects.

Likely Regions: Brevoy, Irrisen, Lands of the Linnorm Kings, Mendev, Realm of the Mammoth Lords.
