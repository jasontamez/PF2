You have worn armor as long as you
can remember, either as part of your training to become
a knight's squire or simply because you were seeking to
emulate a hero. Your childhood armor wasn't the real
thing as far as protection, but it did encumber you as
much as real armor would have, and you've grown used to
moving in such suits with relative grace. When you wear
armor of any sort, reduce that suit's armor check penalty
by 1, to a minimum check penalty of 0.
