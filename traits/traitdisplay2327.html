Requirement(s) Ustalav
You engaged in nonlethal duels at Fifthstones Hill so often that you gained a visible (though minor) scar on your face. Because of this experience, you're unf linching in the heat of combat, calmly analyzing how to lessen the impact of a foe's best attacks. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attack rolls made to confirm a critical threat against you.
