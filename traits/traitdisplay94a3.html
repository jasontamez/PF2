You were trained to harvest all parts of an
animal with care and precision. You gain a +1 trait bonus
on Profession (tanner) or Profession (trapper) checks, and
you may make these checks as if you were trained in the
skill even if you have no ranks. Additionally, you do not
risk poisoning yourself whenever you handle or apply
poison taken from a venomous creature.
