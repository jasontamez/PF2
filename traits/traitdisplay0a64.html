Like a climber ascending a mountain, you gradually grow acclimatized to an opposing planar alignment. For each consecutive day you remain on a mildly aligned plane that opposes your alignment, reduce your penalty on Charisma-based checks by 1, to a minimum of 0. This does not affect the penalty from a strongly aligned plane.
