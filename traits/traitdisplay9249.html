Requirement(s) Katapesh
You spent a significant portion of your childhood as a slave, but were freed from slavery several years ago by a benevolent master who purchased you from an auction after your previous master's death. Yet while the memories of your difficult childhood still haunt you, the hard life did toughen you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves.
