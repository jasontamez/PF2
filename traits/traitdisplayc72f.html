Category Basic (Combat)
You draw strength from adhering to the Ichimeiyo honor code in combat. Once per day, if an effect would compel you to harm an ally, abandon an ally, or break your word, you can attempt a Will save at the usual DC to end the effect. If the effect normally allows a Will save at this point, you can roll twice and take the better result.
