Your connection with a malignant force has granted you great power. Choose a domain granted by an evil aligned deity, such as an archdevil, demon lord, or Great Old One. You gain a +1 trait bonus to your caster level when casting spells that are granted by that domain. This doesn't grant you the ability to cast such spells-you must still have access to the spells through some other means.
