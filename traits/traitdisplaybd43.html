Once wronged, your vengeance can be swift and brutal. Once per day as an immediate action, you gain a +1 trait bonus on a single attack roll. In addition, if the target has damaged you within the last round, you deal 1 additional point of damage on a successful hit. You must choose to use this ability before making the attack roll.
