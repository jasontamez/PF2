Terrible things prowl the moors of your homeland, and you are all too familiar with hiding or fleeing from them. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks when you are in bog, marsh, or swamp terrain, and you treat shallow bogs and swamp undergrowth as normal terrain for the purposes of movement.
