Whenever you damage an opponent that is casting a spell with a melee attack that deals fire damage (such as a flaming weapon or a torch), the DC of the concentration check for your opponent to cast the spell is equal to 10 + the non-fire damage dealt + double the fire damage dealt + the spell's level (instead of just 10 + the damage dealt + the spell's level).
