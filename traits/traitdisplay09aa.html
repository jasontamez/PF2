Before you even began your training as a spellcaster, you spent a great deal of time studying cantrips and simple spells on your own. Because of this, you developed some innate magical abilities without any outside guidance. Select one cantrip and one 1st-level spell; when you cast these spells, they function at one caster level higher than your actual caster level.
