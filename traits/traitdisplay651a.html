Requirement(s) Any Subterranean Dungeon
Not only are you competent while deep underground, you thrive in these perilous environs. Whether you were born in one of the labyrinthine tunnels that riddle the islands of the Shackles or your mysterious parental figures brought you up in the sand-ridden corridors of some forgotten Osirian pyramid, your emergence on Golarion is somehow tied to one of the world's infamous subterranean dungeons. You start with one additional language chosen from the following list: Aklo, Dark Folk, Draconic, Goblin, Necril, Orc, or Undercommon. In addition, whenever you must attempt a Survival check to avoid getting lost in a dungeon, you may roll the check twice and take the better result. Suggestion: Consider playing an uncommon race from the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide.
