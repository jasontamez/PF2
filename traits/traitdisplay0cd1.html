Your outlandish purple scales made you
an outcast from your tribe and forced you to survive in
isolation at the edges of kobold society. While wandering
alone through the Darklands, you contacted several
other underground races and expanded your linguistic
repertoire. In addition to speaking Draconic, you begin
play with the ability to speak one of the following: Aklo,
Dwarven, Goblin, or Undercommon.
