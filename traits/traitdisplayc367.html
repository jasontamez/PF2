Requirement(s) The Shackles
You were one of only a few that
survived the destruction of the merchant vessel Vantage. Your
crew was more than able to hold off the blundering pirate
attackers, but their red dragon ally proved too much for
your defenses. As you watched the sharks and eels feast on
the bodies of your fallen comrades, you vowed to see Aashaq
slain. You gain a +2 bonus on Ref lex saves against spells and
effects with the fire descriptor.
