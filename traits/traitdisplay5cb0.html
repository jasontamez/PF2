Category Basic (Faith)
You are suspicious of those who lead spiritual lives and are quick to seek out the smallest hypocrisy in even the most pious individuals. Of course, you are also keenly aware of the power the faithful can draw from their worship, and you are stubbornly resistant to it. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against divine spells that target only you.
