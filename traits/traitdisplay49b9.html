Your grandiose posturing often makes it difficult for anyone to concentrate around you. Once per day as a full-round action, you may attempt to distract adjacent foes with a lengthy display of your martial prowess. All adjacent foes must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier) or gain the shaken condition. This condition persists for 1 round.
