You were raised in a community that included numerous individuals who spoke with creatures of the wild. You gain one of the following languages of your choice as a bonus language: Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Giant, Ignan, or Sylvan. With your GM's permission, you can instead select Druidic, but druids are protective of their language-you are likely to find yourself hunted by druids wishing to eliminate you as a threat to their sole ownership of their secrets.
