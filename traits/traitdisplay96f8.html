Scorned by Magic

Category Basic (Magic)
As a youth, you assisted a wise
woman or witch doctor who removed magical maladies
from the needy and was present for the breaking of many
spells-or perhaps you passed through a dead magic
zone. Whatever the cause, magic seems a little more
reluctant to affect you than others. Reduce the caster level
of spells and spell-like abilities cast upon you by 1 for
the purpose of attempting dispel checks and overcoming
your spell resistance (if any).

Suggested Characters: Kellids, Mana Wastes natives, Shoanti.
