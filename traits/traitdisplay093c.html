The murky tunnels of your tribal home
were infested with voracious oozes, which were a constant
threat to your tribe. To protect yourselves, you and your
tribespeople never strayed far without anti-ooze acid.
You begin play with three alkali flasks (Pathfinder RPG
Ultimate Equipment 106). These don't count against your
starting character wealth.
