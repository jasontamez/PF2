Requirement(s) Riddleport
You've sold relics to a Cyphermage in the past, and she's agreed to assist you with future findings. When in Riddleport, you can use your contact to gain information about artifacts and history. Treat this ability as a single Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history) check with a skill bonus of +15. You may make this check once per day that you spend in Riddleport. You can make a new check every day. Each time you do so, you can choose whether to use Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history).
