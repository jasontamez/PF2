You feel safe and secure in urban environments, even in cities whose laws you find unjust-it is the physical fact of the city that you take solace in. In any settlement, you gain a +2 trait bonus against fear effects. If you fail a save against a fear effect, you may make a new save each round you remain in the city to overcome the fear effect as long as the fear effect persists. If you are a paladin, this ability to make additional saves to overcome fear extends to all allies within your aura of courage.
