You are experienced in interpreting and applying legal doctrine, notably the Laws of Man, independent of any divine mandates. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) checks to settle disputes or arbitrate laws. Once per day if you succeed at an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe who has repudiated or ignored a pronounced judgment you've made, you may choose to cause the creature to be sickened instead of shaken. The duration of the effect remains the same.
