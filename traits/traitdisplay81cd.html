Requirement(s) Plane of Water
For whatever reason, you spent much of your formative years fighting to keep yourself alive amid the fearsome creatures that inhabit the infinite oceans of the Plane of Water, and you learned how to stay hidden even against predators with unusual senses. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Stealth checks while underwater. Once per day, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide in plain sight (as the ranger class feature of the same name) while underwater. This is only effective against creatures that rely on blindsense, blindsight, or tremorsense. Creatures with other senses perceive you normally.
