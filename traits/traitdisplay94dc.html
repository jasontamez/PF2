Requirement(s) Darklands, usually under warm
mountains
Having grown up navigating rockslides and
picking your way through partially collapsed tunnels, you
are able to determine the most stable path across difficult
terrain caused by rubble or other debris. You can move
normally through such obstructed spaces, and can run or
charge though them with a successful Acrobatics check.
