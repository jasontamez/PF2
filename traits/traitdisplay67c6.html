Every time that you've said you-d do something, you've made sure to follow through. You can't remember a time when you weren't this way. People have a hard time making you change your mind once you've set yourself on a certain path. You might be exceptionally stubborn or you may just have a particular determination. Either way, you're going to keep doing what you set your mind to. The Bountiful Venture Company recognized this useful trait of yours and selected you for the second wave of colonists because of your great resolve and unswerving dedication to what you set your mind upon.

Once per day when you fail a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect that would cause you to act differently than you normally would, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it's worse.
