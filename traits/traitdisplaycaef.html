Requirement(s) Zura
You come from a cannibal tribe, and find strength in the flesh of your foes. Whenever you eat the flesh or drink the blood of another orc-a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity- you gain the favor of Zura and receive a +1 natural armor bonus for 1 minute/level. You can only receive this benefit once per day.
