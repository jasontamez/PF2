You expect the worst and have rarely been disappointed. Your dour outlook may hail from the original destruction of Roslar's Coffer at the hands of the Twisted Nail tribe, the exile of the faithful from the nearby Sarenite temple, or some more personal misfortune, but it has set you apart among the largely forward-thinking population of Lastwall. Your faith that the worst possible outcome will occur grants you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. Your frustrating pessimism can spur friends to succeed just to spite you; once per day as a free action, you can force an ally within 30 feet to reroll a saving throw she just failed, using the better of the two results.
