Requirement(s) Absalom
Ever since you were a child growing up in one of Absalom's vast city quarters, you've been obsessed with the Starstone Cathedral and the prospect of acquiring true divinity by passing the Test of the Starstone. Though it remains to be seen whether you will ever achieve your long-standing dream, your fascination with the would-be deities who enter the Starstone Cathedral and never come back has granted you no small measure of savvy when it comes to preparing to explore dungeons. You start with a kit (such as those found on page 7 or in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment) worth no more than 300 gp, and the expendable contents of the kit are automatically restored to their original capacity at no cost to you whenever you enter a settlement with a population of at least 2,500. Suggestion: Consider playing a character who worships, reveres, or perhaps even envies one of the Ascended- Cayden Cailean, Iomedae, or Norgorber.
