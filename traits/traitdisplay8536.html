You've studied the methods of both elven and human spellcasters. Pick two classes when you gain this trait-your caster level in each of those classes is treated as 1 higher as long as this doesn't raise your caster level above your total Hit Dice. This doesn't stack with any similar increase from traits such as Magical Knack.
