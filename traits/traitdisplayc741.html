Your birth was
particularly painful and difficult
for your mother, who needed
potent divine magic to ensure that
you survived (your mother may or may
not have survived). In any event, that magic infused you
from an early age, and you now channel divine energy with
greater ease than most. Whenever you channel energy,
you gain a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of your channeled
energy.
