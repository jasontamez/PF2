Requirement(s) Crown of the World
You are one of the brave travelers who have traversed the Path of Aganhei, a lucrative trade route from Tian Xia to Avistan that crosses the frigid Crown of the World. These voyages have left you hardier, granting you a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws to resist the effects of cold weather. Survival is a class skill for you, and you gain Hallit, Hon-La, Minkaian, Skald, or Tien as a bonus language.
