Your code of honor, obligations, and taboos stem from the shame of a misspent youth. Now, a personal code reminds you how to live, and you have an impressive ability to resist temptation. Once per day, if a mindaffecting effect would compel you to take an action that would cause you to lose Honor Points (see page 8), you may make a new saving throw against the original DC to end the effect.
