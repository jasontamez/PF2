Broken firearms are not problems-they
are challenges. Your first attempt to remove the broken
condition from your starting firearm and to upgrade it
to a masterwork weapon costs 150 gp instead of 300 gp.
In addition, when wielding a firearm that has the broken
condition or is treated as if it had the broken condition,
you take a -1 penalty on attack rolls made with it instead
of the normal -2.
