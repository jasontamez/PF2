You grew up in the church of <a href="deitydisplay86e0.html?ItemName=Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a>, and have served as a faithful follower your entire life. You've studied the unholy texts, committed the rigid hierarchies of Hell to memory, and striven to eliminate emotion and mercy from your mind in emulation of the Prince of Darkness. You may have continued your career in the church, officially joining the priesthood and aspiring to advance to positions of higher authority and greater power, or you may have left the church, deciding the life of a priest was not for you. In either case, the education you received in the church has remained with you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy, Knowledge (planes), and Knowledge (religion) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is a class skill for you. You also know the Infernal tongue (this does not count toward your number of languages).
