You have adopted the ways of the colonials. As a result, you feel that other, "inferior" races'such as your Mwangi brethren'should obey you as they do the colonials. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Intimidate checks to influence Mwangi natives, but you suffer a -2 on Diplomacy checks to influence them.
