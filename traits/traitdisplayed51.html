Category Basic (Social)
Growing up with no one to rely on
but yourself, you learned to keep a realistic view of your
situation and avoid falling into the trap of cynicism
with a healthy dose of wit. As a standard action, you can
joke about a troublesome situation to lighten the load of
dealing with it for yourself and others. You and all allies
within 30 feet who can hear you gain a +2 morale bonus
on saving throws against fear and pain effects for 1d4
rounds. A character cannot benefit from this effect more
than once in 24 hours.

Suggested Characters: Galtans, Rahadoumi, Ustalavs.
