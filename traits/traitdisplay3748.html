Either from inborn talent, the whimsy
of the gods, or obsessive study of strange tomes, you have
mastered the use of a cantrip. Choose a 0-level spell. You
may cast that spell once per day as a spell-like ability.
This spell-like ability is cast at your highest caster level
gained; if you have no caster level, it functions at CL 1st.
The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based.
