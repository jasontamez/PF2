You could be the child of an alchemist, wizard, or witch; a member of the Pathf inder Society; or maybe someone with a touch of fey or dragon blood. You may not be trained in magic, and you've had your share of accidental mishaps, but you possess a natural knack for activating magic items. you've always been intrigued by the cold magic of the winter witches and ice mages of the North, and would love to get your hands on some of their magic items. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Use Magic Device checks, and Use Magic Device is a class skill for you.
