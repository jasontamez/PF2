For your whole life, you've felt there was a world just beyond the fabric of the material objects around you, and sometimes you can hear the north wind calling you or smell the dread taint of polluted water before you taste it. You do not gain the normal list of spell-like abilities for the gnome magic racial trait presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Instead, if you have a Wisdom of 11 of higher, you gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day-detect poison, know direction, stabilize, and speak with animals. The caster level for these effects is equal to your character level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + your Wisdom modifier.
