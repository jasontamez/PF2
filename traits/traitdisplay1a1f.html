The shadow in the sky is visible from all around Riddleport, not just in town. It's certainly come to the attention of several druids, rangers, and other rural folk who dwell in the nearby mountains, forests, and swamps-among them, yourself. You've consulted with several seers and Harrowers, and may even have performed some simple auguries yourself, and all the signs point the same way'something or someone in Riddleport is connected to the blot, and it means bad news for the region. You've avoided the sleazy, dirty town for most of your life, traveling there only when absolutely necessary, and although you don't relish the prospect of going there now, you see little other choice (especially if one of your superiors is ordering you to go investigate). Fortunately, an eccentric friend of yours (pick another PC) is in town, and You've heard this friend will be taking part in some gambling thing at a place called the Gold Goblin. Your friend's always had better luck interacting with the cityfolk, so You've decided to accompany your friend to this gambling tournament and plan on letting him find a safe place for you to stay while you're in town. Your long life of self-sustenance has toughened you and made you more resistant to hardship, in any event-pick one of the three categories of saving throw. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws of that type.
