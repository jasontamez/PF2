You or one of your parents belonged to a coven that honored the norns-powerful fey seers-and you still bear their favor in the form of a subtle sense for danger. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Perception checks to notice traps and ambushes, and a +1 trait bonus to your AC against traps and during any surprise round in which you are caught unaware.
