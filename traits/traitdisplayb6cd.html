Your birth was marked by the alignment of Aucturn with your birth sign and by strange happenings, giving you a link to alien beings. When feinting against aberrations, you do not take a -4 penalty for feinting against a non-humanoid creature, and you take only a -4 penalty if you feint against an aberration of animal Intelligence (instead of -8). You still cannot feint against mindless creatures.
