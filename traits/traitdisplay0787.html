Requirement(s) Skinwalker-Wererat-Kin
You first discovered your wererat-related abilities while escaping someone, whether the authorities or a rival, and ever since you have honed your ability to squeeze out of tight situations. Whenever you use your skinwalker ability to change shape into your bestial form, you can squeeze through narrow spaces at least half as wide as your normal space without slowing your movement; each move into or through a narrow space counts as 1 square, though you still take all the normal penalties associated with squeezing.
