Requirement(s) Aquatic origin
Growing up in an aquatic environment, where three-dimensional movement and perception were necessary, has given you keen observational skills and the ability to notice and target unusual positions with ranged attacks. You gain a +1 trait bonus on ranged attack rolls when your target is at least 10 feet above or below you.
