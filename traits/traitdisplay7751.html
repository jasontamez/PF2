Requirement(s) Hermea
You are the product of generations of
selective breeding, organized by the gold dragon Mengkare.
Your education is top-notch, and you have a broad base of
knowledge. Unfortunately, the isolation of Hermea has
also made you slightly naive. You gain a +1 trait bonus on
Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion) checks but
take a -1 penalty on all Sense Motive checks.
