An outsider visited you at a young age, and you have had a significant affinity with that type of outsider ever since. Choose a subtype of outsider, such as angel or elemental. When you summon an outsider of that subtype via summon monster, planar ally, planar binding, or similar spells and abilities, the summoned creature gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the level of spell used to summon it.
