Requirement(s) any Outer God
Your spellcasting powers are infused with the powers of the occult Outer Gods. Whenever you cast a spell or spell-like ability with the curse descriptor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 251), increase the DC of the spell's saving throw by 1. If you cast such a spell or spell-like ability at night, as long as the sky is clear and the stars are visible, treat your caster level as 1 higher when determining the spell's duration.
