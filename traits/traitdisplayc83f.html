If you would take a penalty for using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds without one or more uses of a healer's kit, that penalty is reduced by 2 (minimum no penalty). Additionally, a creature can benefit from you treating its deadly wounds if you do so within 48 hours of its injury instead of within 24 hours.
