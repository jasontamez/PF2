Category Basic (Social)
At least once in your childhood, your family
moved for a reason you didn't understand and you were
forced to leave behind your old friends and make new ones.
Ever since, you have always been the first to meet strangers,
make new friends, and welcome travelers. You learned that
first impressions are the most important, and have a knack
for making a good one. Once per day, when you attempt a
Diplomacy check to improve a creature's attitude toward
you, you may choose to reroll the check after the first roll
is made but before the results are revealed. You must take
the second result, even if it is worse.

Suggested Characters: Eagle Knights, Garundi, Pathfinders.
