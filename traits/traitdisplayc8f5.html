Category Drawback
You were raised with the
belief that your family was special, and that those of
your status always succeed at whatever they do. Due to
your concern about upholding the family name and your
memories of the consequences for disappointing them
(such as violence or unsettling disapproval), you are
easily frustrated. When you fail at a skill check, you take
a -2 penalty on checks with that skill until you succeed
or until you fail at a different skill check, whichever
comes first.
