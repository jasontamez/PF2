You call upon your quah's totem to grant you power. You gain a unique totem aspect that replaces one of the animal aspects granted to you by the animal focus feature. You must be a hunter or have access to the animal aspect class feature to select this trait, and you must choose the Shoanti quah to which you belong. You gain access to the totem aspect listed for that clan, and you lose access to the animal aspect listed. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.
