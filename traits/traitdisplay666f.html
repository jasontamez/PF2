Requirement(s) Trudd
When you were too young to fight, you witnessed a great tragedy befall an innocent and you swore to Trudd you-d become strong enough to prevent something like that from happening again. Once per day when you hit a foe with a melee attack, you can attempt an aid another action as a free action to increase an adjacent ally's AC against that foe. If you succeed, you grant the ally a +4 bonus to AC instead of a +2 bonus for that round.
