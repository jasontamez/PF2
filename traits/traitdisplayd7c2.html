Requirement(s) Plane of Fire
Raised among the efreet of the Plane of Fire, you developed a similarly assured sense of superiority over people from other backgrounds. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate checks against humanoids of a subtype different from your own (or all non-human humanoids, if you are not a humanoid), and the DC for such creatures to demoralize you with Intimidate is 2 higher than usual.
