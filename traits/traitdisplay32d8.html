Requirement(s) Kobold-Green-Scaled
You are familiar with the flora
of your native forest and have rudimentary skill as an
herbalist. Once per day, you can attempt a DC 20 Survival
check instead of a Craft (alchemy) check to create a single
dose of scent cloak (Ultimate Equipment 105) without
paying any cost for raw materials. Any scent cloak created
using this method must be used within 24 hours, or it
becomes inert.
