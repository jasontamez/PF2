There is a dark hunger in you that rejoices when you or an ally slays a foe. Once per day when an enemy creature is killed, you may, as an immediate action, gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the slain foe's Hit Dice. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. This is a supernatural ability.
