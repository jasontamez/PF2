Requirement(s) Kyonin
Your campaign against Treerazer has endeared you to Kyonin's rangers, who have taught you their ways. When you gain this trait, select one ranger trap that doesn't deal ability or hit point damage. You can use this trap once per day within a forest. The DC for your trap is equal to 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum +0), and it lasts for 1 day. If you are not a ranger, you can set only extraordinary traps with this feat; like all extraordinary ranger traps, this decreases the trap DC by 2.
