Category Basic (Magic)
You are often struck with
epiphanies about alchemical processes and substances.
Once per day as a free action, you may gain a trait bonus
equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 0) on a Craft
(alchemy) check you make. You can apply this bonus
after you roll the check, possibly turning a failure into
a success.
