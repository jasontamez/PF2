Using an ancient and painful surgical technique, you've reshaped your tongue. These surgical mutilations permit you to speak ancient words unpronounceable to most mortals, enhancing your ability to work magic associated with the Great Old Ones. Any summoning or divination spell you cast to summon or contact a Great Old One or one of their minions is cast at +1 caster level.
