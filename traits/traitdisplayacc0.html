Category Drawback
You have a terrible fear of the public at large, a group, or an important person (such as your order of knights, your liege lord, your family, or your lover) learning a shameful truth about you. You take a -1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects, and the DC of any Intimidate check to demoralize you is reduced by 1. If you would normally be immune to fear, you do not take these penalties, but instead lose your immunity to fear (regardless of its source).
