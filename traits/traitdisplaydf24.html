Your hours of meditation
on inner perfection and the nature of strength and speed
allow you to focus your thoughts to achieve things your
body might not normally be able to do on its own. Select any
Strength-, Constitution-, or Dexterity-based skill. You may
make checks with that skill using your Wisdom modifier
instead of the skill's normal ability score. That skill is always
a class skill for you.
