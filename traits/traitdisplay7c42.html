Requirement(s) [Halfling] Desna
Your dreams often give you a hint of possible dangers you might face during your day'such as a fall, a blast of fire, or a poisonous snake- and this hint sometimes makes all the difference. Each time you sleep, the GM tells you of a dangerous dream you had. Once per day, if you have to make a saving throw against a threat related or similar to that dream, you can roll twice and take the more favorable result. If you do not encounter circumstances similar to the threat or situation you dreamed, this trait has no effect that day. If you have the Halfling Jinx trait (see page 27), you cannot select this trait, and vice versa.
