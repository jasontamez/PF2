Perhaps you were born at the bottom of Taldan society and you're tired of seeing your friends and family toil endlessly with no hope of a better life, or maybe your privileged outlook was shattered by empathy or tragedy. Either way, you know the system is broken, and you've dedicated your life to fixing it. But tradition rules Taldor as much as any Grand Prince, and change requires more influence than you have- so far. you've got a few friends and allies, and plenty of determination, but while you work toward the power you need to change the nation, you'll have to resort to more discrete ways of righting wrongs and curbing the abuses of the upper class. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Disable Device and Knowledge (local) checks, and one of these skills is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you can call upon your coconspirators to have "made arrangements" on your behalf, allowing you to attempt a Knowledge (local) check in place of a single Bluff, Disable Device, Intimidate, or Sleight of Hand check. The DC of this Knowledge (local) check is equal to the DC of the skill check it replaces. Whatever arrangements you make-for doors left unlocked, guards strong-armed out of your way, stolen keys left for you to find-must be reasonable to have anticipated and achieved beforehand; you could arrange to have a noble convinced you're a very important diplomat traveling in disguise, for example, but if a fight breaks out you could not rely on your network of contacts to feint for you in combat. You don't have to use this ability in advance; you can announce its use as you encounter a challenge, implying you foresaw this challenge and made arrangements prior to your arrival.
