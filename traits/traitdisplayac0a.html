Requirement(s) Half-Elf
As a child, your parents sent you to a
distant wizard's tower as an apprentice so that you could
learn the arcane arts. Unfortunately, you had no arcane
talent whatsoever, though you did learn a great deal about
the workings of spells and how to resist them. You gain a
+1 trait bonus on saves against arcane spells.
