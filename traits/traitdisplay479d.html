Requirement(s) any desert
Desert orcs have learnt to survive with practically nothing in the desert. You receive a +2 trait bonus on Survival checks made in a desert, and resolve all checks at becoming lost in deserts as though you had proper navigational tools (a +4 bonus). The presence of such tools does not increase your ability, however.
