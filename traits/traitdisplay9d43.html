You were born aboard a ship at sea or down by the docks in a port city on an auspicious day. Old salts and sea dogs nod knowingly and say that Besmara the Pirate Queen, goddess of piracy, sea monsters, and strife, has marked you for a greater destiny. You don't know anything about that, but you've always felt more at home on the sea than on land, and your keen eyes can easily pick out a sail on the distant horizon. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception and Profession (sailor) checks. In addition, once per week you can reroll a Profession (sailor) check and take the higher result (you must announce that you are using this ability before the results of the check are known).

You came to a tavern in Port Peril called the Formidably Maid in search of your fate. You're not sure how many drinks you had, but they quickly went to your head and you passed out on the table before you found your destiny-unless it lay in the bottom of a bottle. Then again, maybe you found your destiny after all...
