Your massive ears are your pride and joy, and other goblins claim you can hear a flea scream as it falls off a goblin dog. While this might not quite be the case, you gain a +2 bonus on all Perception checks made to hear noises. Additionally, you can hear noises that normally only dogs or other animals can hear, like the sound of a dog whistle.
