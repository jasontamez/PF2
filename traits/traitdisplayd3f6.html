Your tribe, in an effort to emulate
the green chromatic dragons they admire, goes to great
lengths to secure alchemical coal (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate
Race Guide 135). As a member of a green kobold tribe, you
begin play with three pieces of the choking smoke variety
of alchemical coal. Eating one of these pellets allows you
to exhale noxious vapors, damaging and sickening your
enemies. These pellets do not count against your starting
character wealth.
