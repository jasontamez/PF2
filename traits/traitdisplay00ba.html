While the worship of <a href="deitydisplay86e0.html?ItemName=Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a> is widespread throughout Cheliax, you follow a different path: that of the philosophy of diabolism. Asmodeus and the other archdevils are worthy of respect and emulation, certainly, but rather than worship one Lord of Hell above all others, your faith is instead based on the veneration of the order and laws of Hell itself as a model for a perfect society. Free will must be suppressed to prevent rebellion, slavery is required to keep the unworthy in their place, and evil and cruelty are necessary for good and kindness to exist.

You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks, and Knowledge (planes) is a class skill for you. You also know the Infernal tongue (this does not count toward your number of languages). In addition, your studies of Hell's underlying structure give strength to your determination. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Will saves against the mind-affecting effects of outsiders with the good subtype.
