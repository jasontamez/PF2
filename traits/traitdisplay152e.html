Category Basic (Magic)
At a young age, you saw a witch burned
by fearful peasants, druids falsely punished for demon
worship, or another sort of spellcaster persecuted for
merely practicing her dubious craft. Intent on not
suffering the same fate, you approach spellcasting with
a powerful desire to control how your magic is perceived
by others. You can cause spells you cast to manifest with
strange visual, auditory, or olfactory features that make
them hard to identify. Choose a school of magic. The
Spellcraft DC to identify spells you cast from that school
of magic increases by 2. Onlookers who fail a Spellcraft
check to identify your spell by 2 or less incorrectly
identify the spell as another randomly selected spell of
the same school and level.

Suggested Characters: Gnomes, Razmir worshipers, witches.
