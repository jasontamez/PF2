Requirement(s) Osirion
You are descended from one of Ancient Osirion's pharaohs, and a sliver of her otherworldly power has been passed onto you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves against fear effects. Any time you become confused, reduce the duration of the effect by a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (to a minimum of 1 round of confusion).
