One of your legs was bitten off below the knee by a shark when you were just a child, and was replaced with a wooden peg leg (Pathfinder Player Companion: Pirates of the Inner Sea 20). You've long since gotten used to your prosthesis, however, and take none of the normal penalties from having a peg leg. You've had to learn to deal with the pain of your injury as well, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves. Ever since your accident You've hated sharks, and you also gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls against sharks and other animals with the aquatic subtype.

Your balance always gets a bit shaky after a few drinks, and last night at the Formidably Maid-a tavern in Port Peril-was no exception. That must be why you fell to the floor as soon as you tried to stand up. What happened next is hazy, but you're pretty sure you were dragged out of the bar and onto a ship at the docks. At least they didn't throw you to the sharks...
