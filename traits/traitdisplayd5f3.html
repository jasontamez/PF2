At your birth, your parents
dedicated your soul to Iomedae to mold into a sword of her
light. The goddess blessed you, granting you a gift of light
to brighten your path through darkness and a fine sword
with which to spread her will. You may cast light once per
day as a spell-like ability (caster level 1st), and you begin
play with a masterwork longsword. In addition, whenever
light is cast upon this sword, the radius of light and its
duration is doubled.
