You know a little bit about most everything and everyone in Roslar's Coffer. It may be your profession, as you could be an archivist, crier, or librarian-or you simply make a hobby of gossip. Either way, you have a gift for recall and reading others. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) checks, and these both become class skills for you. Once each day you can reroll a single Bluff or Sense Motive check against a creature you have known for at least 24 hours, using the better result.
