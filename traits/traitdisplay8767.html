Requirement(s) Akiton
You were raised on Akiton, where you were hardened against the ravages of battle. Once per day, the first time you are brought below 0 hit points but not killed, you can fight on for 1 more round as if disabled. At the end of your next turn, unless brought to above 0 hit points, you immediately fall unconscious and begin dying.
