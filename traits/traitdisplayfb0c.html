You can modify old clothing to make it effective in new circumstances. With a basic sewing kit or disguise kit, you can make a Disguise check to change one outfit into another outfit (see page 159 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, or page 13 of this book). The DC of this check is equal to 10 + the gp difference between costs of the outfits. The alteration takes 10 minutes per 1-gp difference in the cost of the outfits.
