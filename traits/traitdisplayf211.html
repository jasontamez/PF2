Pledging your faith to Norgorber's lethal shadow gives you the skill to make a brutal attack against an opponent who cannot fully fend you off. When you hit a foe you are flanking, you deal an additional 1 point of damage (this damage is added to your base damage, and is multiplied on a critical hit). This additional damage is a trait bonus.
