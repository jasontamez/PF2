If you follow this code, you are known to be single-minded with regard to slavery, and this fervent belief is easily perceived by others. Those who deal in flesh have a greater desire to appease you before matters escalate to confrontation, knowing that your wrath will be unwavering and swift. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks made to sway the minds of slavers and anyone who otherwise keeps innocent people against their will.
