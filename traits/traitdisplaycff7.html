You possess an innate ability to motivate and inspire others to do the right thing. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks when attempting to persuade a nongood creature to make a decision that benefits the cause of good, and when persuading a nonlawful creature to make a decision in line with the laws of the region. These bonuses stack if you attempt to persuade a nongood, nonlawful creature to take a lawful good action.
