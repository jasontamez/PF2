Requirement(s) Changeling
You were traded for another child in infancy and remained unaware of your origin as a changeling until some recent tragedy revealed the truth. Now the guilt of knowing you live because another child met a horrible fate haunts you and drives you to push forward in that child's name. Once per day, you can attempt a Will saving throw in place of a Fortitude saving throw against a spell, effect, or condition.
