You have spent most of your life learning how to survive in wastelands, and a lack of normal survival resources apparent in the environment is not a problem for you. When you gain this trait, pick one type of wasteland from the following list: blighted, Abyssal, desert, or waterlogged. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Survival checks in that type of wasteland terrain. (The GM determines whether terrain falls into the chosen type of wasteland.) Once you choose a type of wasteland terrain to gain this benefit in, you cannot change it later.
