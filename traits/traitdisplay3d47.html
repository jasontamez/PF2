A large tribe of orcs adapted to life in the desert once dwelt in southeastern Katapesh. Although this tribe is long extinct, some half-orcs of Katapesh carry the traits of this tribe in their particularly large jaws, broad shoulders, and shockingly pale eyes. You often have dreams of hunts and strange ceremonies held under moonlight in the desert sands. Some ascribe these dreams to racial memory, others to visions or prophecies. These dreams have instilled in you a fierce sense of tradition. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all Will saving throws.
