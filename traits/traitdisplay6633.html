Requirement(s) Katapesh
You grew up an orphan on the streets of Katapesh, and spent many years of childhood in the Nightstalls, Katapesh's most infamous market. The strange and often horrific sights you saw there forced you to grow up fast-there's little that can shock or unsettle you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saves against fear effects, and when you do make a successful save against a fear effect, the resulting rush of bravado grants you a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and all skill checks for the next minute.
