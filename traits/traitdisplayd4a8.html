You're skilled at learning the feel of a particular weapon after a few swings in combat. After your first attack with a weapon in which you are not proficient, the non-proficiency penalty decreases by 2 (to a -2 penalty). This effect lasts only while you have the weapon in hand; you must "relearn" the weapon each time you pick it up.
