Raised around those who regarded
most magic as innately dangerous, no matter the source,
you cannot bring yourself to submit to magic willingly
even for your own good. Whenever you are affected with
a harmless spell, there is a 50% chance that you must
roll a saving throw to prevent that effect, even if it would
benefit you. This does not apply to harmless spells cast
by you upon yourself.
