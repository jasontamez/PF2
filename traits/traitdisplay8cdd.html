You can read subtle clues in the body language of fiends, allowing you to react just a bit faster than normal when dealing with such beings. You gain a +1 trait bonus on opposed Dexterity-based skill checks against outsiders with the evil subtype. In addition, when your initiative is tied with such creatures, you always act first regardless of which of you has a higher initiative modifier.
