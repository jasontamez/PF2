Requirement(s) Goblin
Your bones, flesh, and skin are a bit more elastic than those of most goblins-when you fall, you tend to bounce a little better as a result. Whenever you take falling damage, the first 1d6 points of lethal damage suffered in the fall are automatically converted to nonlethal damage. You also gain a +2 trait bonus on all Reflex saves made to avoid unexpected falls.
