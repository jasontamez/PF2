You've always held the strong belief
that morality is everyone's choice, and that those who act
in wicked ways have simply never been shown how their
actions truly affect others. If they could be shown their
errors, then they would accept a more positive course of
action-and you have just enough patience to see this
through. When acting as a sponsor for an evil creature
seeking redemption (see page 18), your patience and
kindness grant the creature a +3 bonus on its save rather
than a +1 bonus.
