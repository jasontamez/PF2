Requirement(s) Vildeis
You interposed yourself between an innocent and a dangerous evil monster or force, lost a great deal of blood as a result, and barely survived. Now, your blood seems to replenish with blessed speed, a sure sign of Vildeis's favor. You recover twice as many hit points and points of ability damage as normal when you rest, or three times as many when you take total bed rest.
