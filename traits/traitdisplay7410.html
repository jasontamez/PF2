In a nation overcrowded with faith, you often worry that your message is drowned out, but nonetheless important. The souls in Roslar's Coffer needed comfort and charity once upon a time, but have bounced back so fully-in part thanks to your hard work-that you worry you've made yourself unnecessary. You are accustomed to long hours, granting you a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saving throws. Your faith is invigorating, and once per day you can lay on hands as a paladin of half your character level (minimum 1). If you gain the lay on hands ability from a class, you instead gain one additional use of lay on hands each day.
