You've always been fascinated by the giant races, and have devoted a considerable amount of time to studying their history and societies, gaining insight into the way they think and use their abilities. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks against creatures with the giant subtype and a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks regarding creatures with the giant subtype, and one of these skills (your choice) becomes a class skill for you. In addition, you know the Giant language (this does not count toward your number of languages).
