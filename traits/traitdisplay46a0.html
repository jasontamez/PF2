The circumstance of your birth and upbringing left little room to accommodate your weaknesses, and many hours toiling in broad daylight have decreased the severity of your innate hindrances. You gain a +2 bonus on checks and saves affected by the Endurance feat (this bonus does not stack with the bonus granted by the Endurance feat). When your light sensitivity causes you to become dazzled, you do not take the -1 penalty on sight-based Perception checks.
