Few understand the medium's willingness to harbor powerful spirits, but even if you aren't one of these talented few, you've always identified with their abilities. you've always felt that you were not alone in this world and that a mysterious guiding spirit watches over you with singular focus. You may have brief ly glimpsed this strange spirit-or maybe you simply feel its presence in times of need. Once per day as a swift action, you can look to your guiding spirit for advice. The next time you roll a d20 in that same round, roll twice and pick the better result. If one of these two rolls is a natural 20, you can use this ability again that same day.
