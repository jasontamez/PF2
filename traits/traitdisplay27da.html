Pathfinders of different backgrounds
don't always realize what's best for them, and you have
perfected the art of forcing your magical boons on your
allies. Whenever you cast a harmless spell, you gain a +2 trait
bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance,
and the saving throw DC of the spell (if any) is increased by 2.
