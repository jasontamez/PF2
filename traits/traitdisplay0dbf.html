Category Campaign
You grew up on the dangerous docks of one of the Shackles' numerous ports or anchorages, and quickly learned that fists often make a better point than fancy words, especially when used the right way. You've always preferred action to talk, anyway. You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls with brass knuckles (Advanced Player's Guide 176) and improvised weapons.

While drinking at a tavern called the Formidably Maid in Port Peril last night, you got into a brawl with some of the other patrons. You handled yourself well, but a group of rough-looking characters ganged up on you and overwhelmed you, knocking you unconscious. Fortunately, you were able to conceal your brass knuckles when you were press-ganged, and you begin the campaign with them, regardless of your starting circumstances.
