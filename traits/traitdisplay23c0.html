One of your ancestors was a conjurer who specialized in binding outsiders of a particular type. You have inherited some of his skills, but also some of his enemies. Choose a single outsider subtype. The DC of your spells increases by 1 against outsiders of the chosen subtype. Outsiders of the chosen subtype gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls made against you, and their starting attitude toward you is reduced by one step.
