You may or may not be seeking membership into Riddleport's most prestigious magical guild, the Order of Cyphers, but you certainly have heard their call for aid in determining the nature of the strange shadow in the sky above Riddleport. You arrived in town several days ago and had some issues with security and safety at several inns before you finally settled on the Gold Goblin; you've been staying there as a guest for several days now, and the owner, Saul Vancaskerkin, seems like a nice guy. He's even given you a pass to attend the gambling tournament he's about to throw-you're not sure how into gambling you'll be, but perhaps there'll be some visitors from out of town you can talk to about the strange shadow in the sky. At the very least, you're hoping someone at the tourney will be into magic-there's not really enough folk in this town who seem all that interested in magic, you've found. Your interest in magic dates back quite far, and as a result, you've developed a knack for identifying common magical items at a glance. You can use Spellcraft to identify magic items in the same way you can use Spellcraft to identify a potion. The DC to identify a magic item is equal to 20 + the item's caster level.
