Requirement(s) Changeling
As changelings sense the awakening of the eerie powers they inherited from their hag progenitors, they are often mortified to discover terrifying and debilitating alterations to their physique. While the call seizes the changelings' minds around the time their bodies begin maturing, the arcane malignancies that mar their features and extremities have nothing to do with puberty.

Not every changeling develops a malignancy, and when a changeling does develop a malignancy, it is often unrelated to whatever traits her hag mother has. These transformations are more akin to a magical allergy, manifesting in response to the well of arcane energy bubbling away in the changeling's core.

A changeling character can take an arcane malignancy as a drawback (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 64) in order to select an additional trait at character creation. Randomly determine the arcane malignancy by rolling a d% and consulting the table below.
