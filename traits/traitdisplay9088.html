Requirement(s) Tiefling
You were born in a nation that persecuted you for your heritage. Although you were under terrible duress, you escaped either with the aid of family or by your own cunning. You gain a +1 bonus on one skill depending on your fiendish heritage: asura (Knowledge [local]), daemon (Sleight of Hand), demodand (Intimidate), demon (Perception), devil (Sense Motive), div (Diplomacy), kyton (Escape Artist), oni (Disguise), qlippoth (Survival), or rakshasa (Sense Motive). That skill is always a class skill for you.
