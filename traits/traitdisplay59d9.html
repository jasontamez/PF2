You helped maintain the interplanetary portals used for trade with other worlds. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify teleportation magic and a +1 trait bonus on caster level checks when casting teleportation spells. You know the proper commands to operate a particular interplanetary portal (it is up to the GM as to where it is and how it operates).
