Requirement(s) Numeria native
Living in Numeria required you to become an expert scavenger, searching through ruins and crash sites for valuables and sustenance. Years spent in this pursuit have given you a keen eye for finding valuables and potentially useful resources in the unlikeliest places. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Perception checks when you search a location for valuables or resources. Appraise is always a class skill for you.
