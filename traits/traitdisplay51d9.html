Category Basic (Faith)
You were initiated into a mystery
cult in your youth, and learned secrets that turned
your understanding of your faith and the world on its
head. This experience has given you a knack for lateral
thinking. Once per day, you may reroll any Knowledge
skill check. You must decide to use this ability after the
first roll is made but before the results are revealed. You
must take the second result, even if it is worse.

Suggested Characters: Mystery cultists, Nethys worshipers,
Norgorber worshipers.
