Category Campaign
The frontier is a land of risk and disorder, and while people are welcome to brave those elements themselves, they all too often bring pain down upon folk who never wanted such a risk. You might serve on the town guard or as part of a detachment of soldiers supported by Vigil, or you could be simply a concerned farmer who endures when others cannot, but your purpose is to stand as a bulwark against the cruel whims of fate for anyone who needs it. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If you have the aura of courage class feature, the bonus provided by your aura increases by 1. Your courage is inspiring; the first time each day you are knocked unconscious or killed, all allies within 30 feet of you immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your level plus your Charisma modifier, as they rally to your defense. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.
