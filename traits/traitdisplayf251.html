For a time during your childhood, you were left in the care of a juju oracle or wendifa, who saw your potential and taught you simple juju magic to inf luence the weakminded for brief periods of time. You can use daze as a spell-like ability once per day, using your character level as your caster level (minimum 1). The save DC of this effect is Charisma-based. The dazed individual looks ashen and deathly for the duration of the effect.
