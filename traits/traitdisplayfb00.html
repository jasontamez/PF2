Requirement(s) [Halfling] Erastil
Few things exalt your faith more than feeding the hungry with your own honest sweat. You gain a +1 trait bonus on any d20 roll to acquire food or water for others. Though this bonus most often applies to Survival checks, it could also apply to attacking monsters that are safe and nutritious to eat (mainly animals and plants). However, Erastil takes a dim view of waste and of those who scorn his favor, and if you abuse this gift (for example, by using the bonus to defeat a bear, then only eating one bite of it), he punishes you with a -2 penalty on attacks, checks, and saves for 24 hours.
