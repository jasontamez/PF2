You employ complex combat tactics with ease. Choose a type of combat maneuver. You gain a +1 trait bonus on combat maneuver checks to perform that maneuver, and you do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the target unless that creature has the appropriate Improved feat, such as Improved Grapple if you attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple. For every two other combat traits you have, choose an additional type of combat maneuver to gain these benefits.
