Category Basic (Social)
Your easygoing demeanor allows you to sometimes recover from potentially awkward social situations or even condemnatory faux pas. Once per day when you fail a Diplomacy check by 5 or more and would cause an NPC's attitude toward you to worsen, you can immediately attempt another Diplomacy check against the same DC as a free action. If you succeed at this second Diplomacy check, the character's attitude doesn't change, as though you had failed the original check by 4 or less.
