Your face is covered with unpleasant pimples and outright boils that have a tendency to pop at inopportune moments. Although this makes you particularly ugly, you're also used to discomfort. Whenever you're subjected to an effect that causes the sickened condition, you may make two saving throws to avoid the effect (if a saving throw is allowed), taking the better of the two results as your actual saving throw.
