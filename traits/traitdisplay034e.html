You have a knack for finding what you need as it washes ashore. Once per week, if you spend 8 hours in a single day searching along a shoreline, you can attempt a Survival check. You find any combination of mundane objects whose value in gold pieces is less than or equal to the result of the check, in a usable (if somewhat waterlogged) condition.
