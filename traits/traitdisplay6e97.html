Category Basic (Magic)
The bond between you and a close sibling
is nearly mystical. Choose a single sibling with whom
to share this bond. Once per day when you fail a saving
throw while your sibling is within 30 feet, you may reroll
that saving throw using your sibling's saving throw
modifier. If you and the sibling are twins or otherwise
part of a multiple birth, you gain a +2 trait bonus on the
rerolled saving throw. Your sibling must be willing to
grant you the reroll. If you fail the saving throw, you and
your sibling are dazed for 1 round.
