Category Basic (Social)
You have a genial personality and make it
a point to befriend and help people wherever you go. In your
travels, you stop to aid others, tell interesting stories, and
often buy rounds of drinks for patrons at the local taverns.
You bring good cheer to those you encounter, and for this
reason, you often find yourself attending important events
or fruitful gatherings, and have even become an honorary
member of many families. People find you trustworthy, and
they are willing to share information with you. You gain a +2
trait bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and
can do so in half the normal time. In addition, Diplomacy
and Knowledge (local) are always class skills for you.
