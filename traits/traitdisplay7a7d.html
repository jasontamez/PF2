You are resistant to most illnesses that strike those around you, but vulnerable to the contagions of evil. You gain a +2 trait bonus on Fortitude saves against diseases. However, whenever you must make a Fortitude saving throw against a disease inflicted by an undead creature or evil outsider (such as mummy rot or a vrock's spores), you do not gain this bonus, and instead take a -2 penalty on your Fortitude save.
