Your parents were both Red Mantis assassins and your family has a long tradition of service in the Red Mantis cult. Your strict, fanatical upbringing and familiarity with murder have bestowed upon you an air of confidence and menace. This grants you a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate checks. If you act during the surprise round, as a free action during that round you can draw a light weapon (or two if you have the Two-Weapon Fighting feat) .
