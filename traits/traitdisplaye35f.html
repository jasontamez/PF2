At some point your family served a dragon, and acted as its emissary to others. Some members of your family have benefited from this arrangement, gaining some small fraction of that dragon's noble bearing. Choose one category of true dragon (chromatic, metallic, primal, etc.). You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks against that category of dragon and a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate checks against all creatures of the dragon type that are not of the same category of true dragon.
