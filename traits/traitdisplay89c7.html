You were
born and raised in rugged badlands or
hills, and you've become something
of an expert at evading the predators,
monsters, and worse that haunt
the highlands. You
gain a +1 trait bonus
on Stealth checks,
and Stealth is always
a class skill for you. This trait
bonus increases to +2 in hilly or
rocky areas.
