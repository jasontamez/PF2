Haunting Regret

Category Drawback
When you were young, a relative
with whom you had frequently quarreled passed away
where his or her soul could not rest. Now, the unquiet
spirit appears around you at inconvenient times,
distracting you with regret for being unable to help.
You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against the
distraction ability of swarms and mind-affecting effects
and on concentration checks.
