You were raised in the
sludgy swamps, and are used to
moving through boggy terrain. You can swim through
a deep bog at up to half your speed as a move action,
instead of the normal quarter speed. Failing a swim check
while in a deep bog doesn't cause you to go underwater,
even if you fail by 5 or more, though such a failure still
results in a lack of progress.
