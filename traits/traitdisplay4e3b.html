You confound those who think they know about elves. Any creature attempting to make a Knowledge check about your people, a Sense Motive check to determine whether you are lying, or a Survival check to track you takes a -2 penalty on the check. Additionally, any character or creature that normally gains a bonus on attack or damage rolls against elves (such as a ranger's favored enemy ability) has such a bonus reduced by 1 (minimum 0).
