Requirement(s) Silver Mount
You are in some way tied to the mysterious alien monument known as Silver Mount in Numeria, but you have forgotten an important piece of your past. Perhaps you were a metallurgist's experiment gone awry, a rediscovered automaton that escaped the mountain's confines, or the result of some equally enigmatic phenomenon. Regardless, your unusual origins mark you as somehow different from others, and you know the gaps in your memory hold the key to your past. You start play with a unique compass that doesn't point north and is riddled with indecipherable alien markings-the only object you have that you know to be tied to your home. In addition, your inscrutable mannerisms give you a +2 trait bonus on opposed Bluff checks. Suggestion: Consider being a member of the android race from Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Bestiary.
