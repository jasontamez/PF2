Westcrown has long suffered under a peculiar curse, a blight that rises every night, bringing with it fell beasts that hunt the shadows. No one can say from whence these night-horrors come-though some blame the mysterious wizards of Nidal, other claim that it's some curse laid by fallen Aroden, while still others suggest some shadowy mastermind manipulates an ebon brood from the depths of Westcrown's northern ruins. Whatever the case, the people of Westcrown have long feared the night, but not you. You're goal is to reclaim the darkness from the beasts that hide within. You've acclimated yourself to the dark, and thus act with greater precision in the shadow than most. When attacking targets in areas of dim light, you do not suffer the standard 20% miss chance on attack rolls for being in the poorly lit area.
