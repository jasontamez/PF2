During your childhood, you knew someone who was addicted to mumia, a drug made from the flesh of the dead, whether that was a drug-addled parent, an unsavory employer, or a libertine childhood friend. Although you did not indulge in the ghoulish narcotic yourself, your exposure to it grants you a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against curses and diseases, including magical diseases. (For more information on mumia, see page 21 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms.)
