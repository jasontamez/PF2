You have nothing to fear from one sort of poison. In fact, you can actually drink the toxic brew in order to make your blood dangerous. You are immune to one specific nonmagical poison (Core Rulebook 559). If you ingest a dose of that poison (even if it is a contact, inhaled, or injury poison), it remains in your system for 24 hours; any creature that bites you during that time is subject to the poison's effects.
