Koya Mvashti might be old enough to be your grandmother, but to you, she's always been your mom. Ever since your parents passed away, Koya's been taking care of you as if she were your mother. You never really figured out why Koya took you into her care, but you do know she's done this before-most recently with Sandru Vhiski, whom you think of as your brother. Growing up, Koya made sure that you had the best education possible, particularly in one particular topic. Choose any Knowledge skill-you gain a +2 bonus on skill checks with that Knowledge skill, and it becomes a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your adoptive mother. NPC Choices: Koya.
