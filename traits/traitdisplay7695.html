You can select a magnetic compass for
your arcane bond class feature; this compass is nonmagical,
but you can later spend 250 gp to upgrade it into a wayfinder.
Choosing this trait allows you to upgrade this wayfinder
to a variant or unique wayfinder per the normal rules for
improving magic items on page 553 of the Pathfinder RPG
Core Rulebook. A bonded wayfinder must be held in your
hand to grant the benefits of being a bonded object.
