The countless natural hazards of the planes cannot deter you from witnessing their grandeur. Once per day you can meditate on the nature of the planes for 1 hour to gain energy resistance 2 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. This resistance lasts 24 hours or until you perform this meditation again and choose a new resistance.
