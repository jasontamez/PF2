You can wield a quarterstaff as either a two-handed or one-handed weapon.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (quarterstaff)</a>, base attack bonus +5.

Benefit:  By employing a number of different stances and techniques, you can wield a quarterstaff as a one-handed weapon. At the start of your turn, you decide whether or not you are going to wield the quarterstaff as a one-handed or two-handed weapon. When you wield it as a one-handed weapon, your other hand is free, and you cannot use the staff as a double weapon. You can take the feat Weapon Specialization in the quarterstaff even if you have no levels in fighter.

When you use this feat to wield a quarterstaff as a one-handed weapon, you can spend 5 stamina points to retain the ability to use it as a double weapon and still keep a hand free. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
