When created, a domain of evil warps reality around it into a foul reflection of its master, with a radius of 5 miles for every Hit Die of its new lord (see the <a href="monsterdisplaydab9.html?ItemName=Dread%20Lord">dread lord template</a>). This radius usually centers on an ancient ancestral manse or cursed cairn that housed the dread lord's family or was the scene of a tragedy that led to the domain's creation. Though domains of evil are still located on their original plane (usually the Material Plane), with all the terrain, weather, flora, fauna, structures, and features normal to the area where they were created, their special natures cause them to have <a href="rules0d4b.html?Name=Planar%20Traits&amp;Category=Planar">planar traits</a> that alter their physical and magical properties, as well as some features exclusive to them. Domains of evil have the following features, as befits the horrible creatures that preside over these realms.

Alignment: If its master has 10 Hit Dice or fewer, a domain gains the mildly aligned planar alignment trait reflecting the alignment of its master. Domains with masters with more than 10 Hit Dice instead become strongly aligned.

Borders: Some domains are formed simply by the foul presence of an evil that has long inhabited the land, whether it's a nosferatu lord lurking in the shadows or a restless ghost bound to the soil of its unquiet grave. The borders of such a domain are open; creatures can freely enter and leave, and its lord can pass to and from its domain without penalty, though the influence he has over his lands doesn't extend past the domain's established borders. Other domains of evil serve as torturous prisons for their cursed lords (see <a href="rulesefc3.html?Name=Cursed%20Domains&amp;Category=Domains%20of%20Evil">Cursed Domains</a>), who find it impossible to leave the realms to which they are bound, oftentimes hindered by a pervasive bank of dread fog that prevents their egress. These mists resist intrusion into the domain, though the strange whims of dark powers might allow passage through the fog for those who might further trouble or torment the land's lord.

Disturbing to Animals: The overwhelming taint of unnatural presences disturbs animals that are not native to a domain of evil. Animals don't willingly approach the domain's border unless their masters succeed at DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy checks, and the masters must continue to attempt checks each hour within the domain to prevent their animals from trying to leave the area. The DCs of all other Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks to influence nonnative animals increase by 5 while the animals remain within the domain's border.

Hazards: The domain morphs into a dark and twisted reflection of its lord, with dangerous landmarks and supernatural hazards (such as the ones on in the <a href="rules14f3.html?Name=Horror%20Hazards&amp;Category=Horror%20Environments">Hazards</a> section) mirroring the master's temperament and personality infesting the landscape. Forests might become darker and more foreboding, full of misleading paths or gnarled oaks that grasp and tear at trespassers. Seemingly sentient fogs drift across the crags and crevices of the land, animating undead in their wakes, while bat colonies infest the domain's caves and ruins. These hazards can shift and change over time as the land reacts to the moods and whims of the dread lord (a slow process that takes at least 24 hours, during which no hazard functions), but the total CR of all hazards found with a lord's domain (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) can't exceed double the dread lord's Hit Dice, and no individual hazard can have a CR that exceeds the dread lord's Hit Dice. If the land is the domain of a cursed lord and bordered by dread fog, the fog's CR value doesn't count against this limit.

Magic: The domain can have the enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait, as befits the personality and temperament of its lord. If the domain has enhanced, impeded, or limited magic, one type of magic per 5 Hit Dice of its lord can be enhanced, impeded, or limited. The categories of magic that are affected are relatively narrow. For example, an entire school of magic would be too broad, but "effects with the healing descriptor or that restore hit points" or "death spells and spells granted by the <a href="domaindisplay1db1.html?ItemName=Death">Death</a> and <a href="domaindisplay2df8.html?ItemName=Repose">Repose</a> domains" would be appropriate. A type of spell can't be both enhanced and impeded by the same domain.

Time: A domain's time passes at the normal rate by default. In some cases, the lord's powerful whims alter the passage of time, whether replicating the slow churning of years felt by a lich's long existence, or the quickening felt by a blood-sated vampire. This alteration can be temporary or permanent, and the domain can have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait.
