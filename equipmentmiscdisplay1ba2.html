Description

This intricate glass and metal jug vibrates gently, and contains a light cloud of white vapor and crackling blue electricity. Djinn of the Plane of Air use thunder kettles to capture the essence of air and lightning elementals within planar super storms. When uncorked as a standard action, a thunder kettle releases a rumbling cacophony of thunder in a 10-foot-radius burst. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of sonic damage and become staggered for 1 round. A successful save halves the damage and negates the staggered condition. This item can be crafted with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
