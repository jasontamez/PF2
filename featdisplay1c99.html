Apocalyptic Spell (Metamagic)

Your spell becomes infused with the devastating horror personified by the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, temporarily transforming reality into a treacherous ruin.

Benefit: You can alter a spell with an area of effect and a duration of instantaneous to become an apocalyptic spell. When you cast the spell, the area affected by the spell's instantaneous effect becomes ruined and devastated in appearance. All surfaces in the area are treated as difficult terrain, and Climb, Fly, and Swim checks attempted in the area take a penalty equal to the spell's original spell level. The difficult terrain and skill penalties last for a number of rounds equal to the spell's original spell level. An apocalyptic spell gains the evil descriptor.

An apocalyptic spell uses a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's normal spell level. Spells with the good descriptor can't be apocalyptic spells.
