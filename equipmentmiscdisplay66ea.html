Description

Smaller and made of stronger materials than most thieves' tools, the items in this kit are much easier to conceal. You gain a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks to conceal these tools on your body. They otherwise function as masterwork thieves tools (granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Disable Device checks).
