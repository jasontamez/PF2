Each madness has a DC representing its strength. Among other things, that DC specifies the saving throw the afflicted character must succeed at to recover from the madness. Recovering from a madness without magical aid is a lengthy process requiring significant rest. After 7 consecutive days of uninterrupted rest, the afflicted character can attempt a Will save against the madness's current DC. If she succeeds, the DC is reduced by a number of points equal to 1/2 the character's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Instead of relying on her own strength of personality to reduce the effects of madness, a character can also seek out a single confidante, priest, or other advisor. The recovering character must meet with that person regularly (at least 8 hours each day) and gain guidance during the 7 days of rest. At the end of the rest period, the ally can attempt a Wisdom or Intelligence check (whichever is higher) with a DC of 15 for a lesser madness or a DC of 20 for a greater madness. On a success, the recovering character can reduce the madness's DC by 1/2 the ally's Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher, minimum 1) in addition to the decrease for resting. The character suffers the madness's effect until the DC is reduced to 0.

Certain spells can also aid in recovery from madnesses or cure them outright. <a href="spelldisplayc2fb.html?ItemName=restoration,%20lesser">Lesser restoration</a> has no effect on greater madnesses, but reduces the current DC of one lesser madness afflicting the target by 2, up to once per day. <a href="spelldisplay8e95.html?ItemName=Restoration">Restoration</a> and <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> reduce the current DC of one lesser madness afflicting the target by 5 or of one greater madness afflicting the target by 2, up to once per day each. <a href="spelldisplay7255.html?ItemName=restoration,%20greater">Greater restoration</a>, <a href="spelldisplay6497.html?ItemName=limited%20wish">limited wish</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayfca1.html?ItemName=psychic%20surgery">psychic surgery</a> all either cure the target of all lesser madnesses or reduce the DC of one greater madness by the spell's caster level (caster's choice), while <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> immediately cure a target of all lesser and greater madnesses.
