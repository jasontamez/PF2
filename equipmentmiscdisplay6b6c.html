Description

Like standard smoke pellets (Ultimate Equipment 105), these specialty pellets fill a single 5-foot square with opaque smoke for 1 round when broken. They can also be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. However, unlike standard smoke pellets, these pellets produce smoke that confers additional effects.

Pepper Pellet: The smoke from a pepper pellet is an ocular and respiratory irritant, and creatures that are hit by a pepper pellet or pass through the smoke must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round.

Smog Pellet: The smoke from a smog pellet is oily, and creatures that are hit by a smog pellet or pass through the smoke are covered in thick residue. This residue makes invisible creatures visible for 1d4 rounds.
