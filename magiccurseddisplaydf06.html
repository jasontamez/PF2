Description

This massive warhammer is even heavier than its size would normally warrant. A creature wielding the hammer
takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a +4 bonus on damage
rolls, as well as a -10 penalty to speed. Once picked up, this
weapon must be used as the creature's primary weapon
until subject to a successful remove curse spell.
