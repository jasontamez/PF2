Description

This finely wrought iron slave collar is embedded with flecks of pyrite and resembles a stylized rendering of a snake eating its own tail. To function, it must be placed around the neck of a helpless living creature of up to Large size. A creature that speaks the command word while touching the collar can hold the wearer accountable to a single service or course of action (as if affected by geas/quest, DC 19) for the next 11 days.

Instead of the penalties associated with that spell, if the wearer deviates from this action or attempts to remove the collar before the service ends-either directly or by encouraging others to-the collar tightens and begins to choke the wearer into submission (as if affected by suffocation). The choking effect ends once the wearer falls unconscious. A serpentine choker can be removed safely if the controlling creature speaks the command word again while touching the collar, or as if it were a cursed item.
