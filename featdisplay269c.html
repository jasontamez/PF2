When you trip one opponent, its fall might take the legs out from under another creature.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip</a>.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can attempt a single trip combat maneuver check at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone as normal and you can attempt an additional trip combat maneuver check (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first target and also within reach. You can attempt only one additional combat maneuver per round with this feat.
