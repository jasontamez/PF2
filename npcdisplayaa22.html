Tunnel drummers keep time for acts of work and war carried out in deep warrens and mine tunnels.

Takina Berzan

Takina's drum and bold voice echo through tunnels to frighten and demoralize opposing forces, and push his companions to fight with greater strength. As the battle rages, he wades into the fray with his mace named Rupture.

Takina strums his lyre of building to protect fortresses against magic or build new defenses for his clan.

Combat Encounters: Takina provides inspiration and healing to dwarven warbands and adventuring parties.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Takina is cheerful among dwarves, but stern to those he doesn't yet trust.
