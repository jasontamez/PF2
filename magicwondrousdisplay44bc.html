Description

This greasy, foul-smelling paste is used to temporarily improve a construct's effectiveness in combat. When smeared onto the body of a construct as a standard action, this substance grants the construct a +2 dodge bonus to AC and a +2 insight bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. Additionally, a construct coated with energizing salve can make an additional attack using its full base attack bonus when making a full-attack action. The salve remains effective for 5 minutes. The salve can be wiped off with an alcohol-based solution, such as ale or wine, as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
