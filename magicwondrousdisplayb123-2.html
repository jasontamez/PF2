Description

These rather nondescript boots can, once per day, be attuned
to a location their wearer is standing upon. Once the boots are
attuned to a location, once per day as a full-round action, the
wearer, along with anything she is wearing or carrying, teleports
back to the attuned location as the getaway spell, except that no
allies are teleported when the boots are activated even if they
were in the area when the boots were attuned to their location.
Once the boots are attuned to a location, they continue to be
attuned to the same location until they are attuned to a new
location.
