Description

Roiling blue smoke fills this small glass bottle, occasionally forming an aged face that vanishes just as quickly. So long as the bottle is worn openly on a creature's body, the Enthroned King's inspiring presence grants its carrier a +1 luck bonus on all ability checks, saving throws, and skill checks. The spirit trapped within is utterly devoted to protecting dwarves, and especially the Sky Citadel of Kraggodan. Three times per day, the Enthroned King may invest his wielder with some of his own immortal life force, granting her 1d10+10 temporary hit points.

Destruction

The Enthroned King must prostrate himself before a powerful servant of Malgrim, the dwarven guardian of the afterlife-a task that requires him to once again have a body rather than his current form of only dust and breath.
