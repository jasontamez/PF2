Gigas, Abaddon Gigas

This lurching mass of spiked iron armor, rotting translucent flesh, and twisted black thorns resembles a dead giant with the head of an oversized boar.

Special Abilities

Devour Souls (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an Abaddon gigas can drain the souls from all living creatures within 60 feet that are not native to Abaddon. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels.

If even one creature is affected, the Abaddon gigas gains fast healing 15 for 15 rounds. If a creature dies from an Abaddon gigas's energy drain special attack, energy drain spell, or devour souls attack, the Abaddon gigas devours that creature's soul, gaining the benefits of death knell at a caster level equal to the dead creature's HD. Such a creature cannot be raised or resurrected by any means until the Abaddon gigas is slain. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Planar Empowerment (Su) While on the plane of Abaddon, an Abaddon gigas can cast each of the following as a spell-like ability once per day: blasphemy (DC 28), earthquake (DC 29), and unholy aura (DC 29) . If the gigas ventures onto another plane, it can't use these abilities (though its other spell-like abilities remain available). The save DCs for these spell-like abilities are Charisma-based and include a +5 racial bonus.

Vile Weapon (Su) As a swift action, an Abaddon gigas can transform its weapon into a +3 wounding adamantine greatsword, a +5 nullifying adamantine spiked gauntlet, a +5 unholy adamantine quarterstaff, a +3 cruel keen scythe, or a +3 weapon of any other kind.

Description

Abaddon gigas are megalithic extraplanar giants that roam Abaddon and embody the same vile energies that permeate that plane. Their cruel forms and unusual powers give them nefarious reputations, and few giant hunters-even among those who traverse the Great Beyond-would willingly seek out one of these monstrosities.

An Abaddon gigas stands over 50 feet tall and weighs 30 tons, not including the weight of its enormous armor.

Ecology

The first known record of an Abaddon gigas dates back to Lamashtu's first struggles with the daemon race, when the Demon Queen captured and murdered two of the Four Horsemen. The putrid remains of the slain Horsemen oozed toward Abaddon's heart, where they merged with the body of a captured Thanatotic titan (and perhaps some of the energy of the fabled Oinodaemon) to create the first gigas on that plane. A hideous and gigantic being of size beyond reason and composed of some of the multiverse's most powerful souls, this mythic gigas soon tore itself into pieces while struggling against its uncompromising quaternary nature. In doing so, this first behemoth created countless "children," the beings known in present times as Abaddon gigas.

Abaddon gigas are asexual and incapable of reproducing; the Abaddon gigas in existence are all there ever will be. This fact is a small comfort, though, considering the terrible might of even a single Abaddon gigas. Worse still, whispered rumors among planar scholars say that, when an Abaddon gigas is slain, its power crawls back toward the heart of Abaddon, where the original mythic Abaddon gigas will one day reform once all its offspring have perished.

Habitat & Society

While some Abaddon gigas serve the Four Horsemen'sensing in these demigods some missing piece of their original selves lost long ago-most instead wander the decrepit wastes of Abaddon in a never-ending search for something they cannot define. The daemons and divs believe that Abaddon gigas roam in search of souls to sate their enormous hunger for life. The rare interplanar scholars who travel to Abaddon claim that the gigas carry out nefarious deeds for fell beings such as olethrodaemons or akvans. Only Charon, the eldest of the current Four Horsemen, knows the true source of the Abaddon gigas' wanderlust: they yearn for the Oinodaemon. The Boatman keeps this secret to himself, and keeps a distant watch over the gigas of Abaddon, though it is unclear whether his surveillance is out of curiosity or some ulterior motive.

Known Gigas of Abaddon

While all Abaddon gigas share a special level of infamy, several of these beings have gained reputations (and unusual powers) that extend beyond the fell lore surrounding their kind. Below are descriptions of two such legendary gigas.

Goros: Thought to be a twisted creation of Trelmarixian the Black, the gigas called Goros possesses even less control over its mental faculties than most Abaddon gigas. The monster resembles a towering naked man with dark red skin the texture of granite. The right half of its body has been mutilated beyond comprehension, revealing a mess of blue veins that intermingle with oozing alien organs and pulsing black guts.

Goros wears no armor (reducing its AC to 22 and its flat-footed AC to 19), and flies into a rage if reduced to half its hit points. While in a rage, Goros gains all the same benefits and penalties as a raging 20th-level barbarian (gaining a +8 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a -2 penalty to AC, and a +4 morale bonus on Will saves), though the gigas doesn't gain any rage powers.

Mephengitan: Mephengitan the Arch-Giant dwells among the icy wastes of Hoarspan, a borderland of polluted arctic waters and vicious icebergs where the fetid swamps of Plaguemere meet with Charon's Drowning Court. The gigas's eyes are the color of a clear winter sky, and on its frosty breath one can hear the whispers of a thousand souls whose lives were claimed by the Arch-Giant.

Mephengitan emits a 30-foot-radius aura of frigid cold. Any living creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of cold damage as its core body temperature plummets and its blood begins to freeze. Creatures that don't need water to live are immune to this effect. Creatures with the water subtype take twice as much as damage.
