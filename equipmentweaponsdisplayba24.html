Description

This double-barreled pistol variant has its barrel attached to its stock by a hinge, enabling ammunition to be loaded quickly and easily. Reloading a breech-loader is a standard action that reloads both barrels; the <a href="featdisplay40f9.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Reload">Rapid Reload</a> feat reduces this to a move action.
