Description

This special ability can be placed only on melee weapons. A spell siphon weapon allows the wielder to siphon a single combat spell from a target. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against the target, she can forgo confirming the critical hit (dealing normal damage) to instead automatically learn what combat spells are active on the target. For the purposes of this ability, a combat spell is any spell that grants a bonus to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, movement, or Armor Class, or on attack rolls, damage rolls, or saving throws.

The wielder can then attempt a check to siphon one of the combat spells of her choice. This check uses either the wielder's caster level or the wielder's base attack bonus plus the weapon's enhancement bonus, and is attempted against a DC of 11 + the targeted spell's caster level. If the wielder succeeds, the target immediately loses access to the spell being siphoned, and the wielder gains the effects of the spell for its remaining duration or 1 minute, whichever is shorter. If the spell siphon weapon has a critical multiplier greater than ??2, the wielder can attempt to siphon one additional combat spell for each additional multiplier beyond 2 (two spells for ??3, three for ??4, and so on).
