Description

This mechanical backpack is a mess of gears and cogs, with two large canvas wings extending out from it to rise over the wearer's shoulders. When the wearer touches the button on the pack's chest harness, the wings whir to life and begin flapping rapidly, hauling the wearer awkwardly into the air.

Lesser wings of flying grant the wearer a fly speed of 30 feet (poor maneuverability).
