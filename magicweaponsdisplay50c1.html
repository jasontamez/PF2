Description

The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This foul-smelling +1 animal-bane dogslicer looks like it was crafted from an assortment of oddities chosen at random from a scrap heap. On command, the wielder can cause the blade to break apart into various pieces of junk that are not obviously a weapon. A second command word causes the junk to reform into a weapon.
