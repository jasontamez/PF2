Description

This mottled green-and-brown +1 shadow studded leather has the symbol of Erastil burned into the shoulder. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can prepare a perfectly aimed shot; as long as the wearer's next attack roll is made before the end of the next round, this attack ignores the target's miss chance and AC bonus from cover and concealment (but not total concealment).
