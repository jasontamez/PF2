You channel the power of your Abyssal patron through your weapon to punish the righteous.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc91e.html?ItemName=Channel%20Smite">Channel Smite</a>, divine caster level 5th, channel negative energy class feature, demon lord patron deity.

Benefit:  When you use Channel Smite against a living creature with a good alignment, you treat all 1s on the channel smite damage dice as 2s.

If your target is either a good outsider or a divine caster who serves a good deity, you are considered 2 levels higher when determining how many channel energy damage dice you roll when using Channel Smite.
