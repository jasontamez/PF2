With a ranged weapon, you can take advantage of any opening in your opponent's defenses.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  While wielding a ranged weapon with which you have Weapon Focus, you threaten squares within 5 feet of you. You can make attacks of opportunity with that ranged weapon. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when making a ranged attack as an attack of opportunity.

Normal:  While wielding a ranged weapon, you threaten no squares and can make no attacks of opportunity with that weapon.

At the end of your turn, you can spend 2 stamina points to increase the range at which you threaten squares with ranged weapons to 10 feet until you take an attack of opportunity against an opponent in the expanded threat range or the beginning of your next turn, whichever comes first.
