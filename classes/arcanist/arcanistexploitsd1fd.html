An arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a full-round action to convert one wand that is in her possession into a wand of a cure spell with the same spell level and caster level (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name). For example, she could convert a <a href="spelldisplay5dc8.html?ItemName=stone%20shape">wand of stone shape</a> into a <a href="spelldisplayccb7.html?ItemName=cure%20serious%20wounds">wand of cure serious wounds</a>. This alteration lasts for 1 minute, after which the wand reverts to its original function. Charges expended while the wand was altered are still expended when it reverts.
