Strength Normal
The arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to move or extinguish one 5-foot square per arcanist level of an ongoing nonmagical fire. If she chooses to move a portion of the fire, it must be moved to a square contiguous with that fire. If she also expends a spell slot of at least 3rd level when activating this ability, she can attempt to dispel a magical fire effect, as <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>.
