Strength Greater
The arcanist can disrupt a spell effect or magic item by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This acts like a targeted <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a> with a range of touch. The arcanist can add her Charisma modifier to the dispel check.
