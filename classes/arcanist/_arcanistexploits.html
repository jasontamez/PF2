Arcanist Exploits

Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide</a>
By bending and sometimes even breaking the rules of magic, the arcanist learns to exploit gaps and exceptions in the laws of magic. Some of these exploits allow her to break down various forms of magic, adding their essence to her arcane reservoir. At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the arcanist learns a new arcane exploit selected from the following list. An arcanist exploit cannot be selected more than once. Once an arcanist exploit has been selected, it cannot be changed. Most arcanist exploits require the arcanist to expend points from her arcane reservoir to function. Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist exploit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcanist's level + the arcanist's Charisma modifier.




<a href="arcanistexploitsdfb4.html?ID=1">Acid Jet</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 9</a>
Strength Normal
The arcanist can unleash a jet of acid by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of acid damage + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). The target is also sickened for 1d4 rounds. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the sickened condition.

<a href="arcanistexploits8bdb.html?ID=41">Altered Shifting</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy965z?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Advanced-Class-Origins">Advanced Class Origins pg. 7</a>
Strength Normal
When the arcanist is under the effect of a spell of the polymorph subschool that she cast, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to change to another valid form allowed by the spell. This reduces the spell's caster level by 1, which can take the spell's caster level below the minimum caster level necessary to cast the spell, and reduces the spell's duration if applicable. The arcanist must have the Lepidstadt shifter exploit to select this exploit.

<a href="arcanistexploits1c06.html?ID=2">Arcane Barrier</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 9</a>
Strength Normal
As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a barrier of magic that protects her from harm. This barrier grants the arcanist a number of temporary hit points equal to her arcanist level + her Charisma modif ier, and lasts for 1 minute per arcanist level or until all the temporary hit points have been lost. Each additional time per day the arcanist uses this ability, the number of arcane reservoir points she must spend to activate it increases by 1 (so the second time it is used, the arcanist must expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir, 3 points for the third time, and so on). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses do cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.

<a href="arcanistexploitsf826.html?ID=48"> Arcane Discovery</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9i8l?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Arcane-Anthology">Arcane Anthology pg. 17</a>
Strength Normal
An arcanist who selects this arcanist exploit learns an <a href="wizardarcanediscoveries.html">arcane discovery</a>. When she learns an arcane discovery, her level must be high enough for her to qualify for that discovery, using half her arcanist level as her wizard level to determine whether she qualifies. The effects of any arcane discovery that she selects with this exploit apply only to arcanist spells that she casts, not to wizard spells, and she cannot select an arcane discovery in place of a feat (unless she also has wizard levels, in which case the discovery applies only to her wizard spells).

<a href="arcanistexploitsdc08.html?ID=3">Arcane Weapon</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 9</a>
Strength Normal
As a standard action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to enhance her weapon. The weapon is treated as magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. At 5th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus, which increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 5th (to a maximum of +4 at 17th level). These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5. An arcanist can also use this exploit to add one of the following weapon special abilities: <a href="magicweaponsdisplayca87.html?ItemName=Dancing">dancing</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay998d.html?ItemName=Defending">defending</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay2c40.html?ItemName=Distance">distance</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay0b68.html?ItemName=Flaming">flaming</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay24ed.html?ItemName=Flaming%20Burst">flaming burst</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplayc7e5.html?ItemName=Frost">frost</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay02b9.html?ItemName=Icy%20Burst">icy burst</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7362.html?ItemName=Keen">keen</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplayf62f.html?ItemName=Shock">shock</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay4179.html?ItemName=Shocking%20Burst">shocking burst</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay6bb5.html?ItemName=Speed">speed</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplayc4e1.html?ItemName=Spell%20Storing">spell storing</a>, and <a href="magicweaponsdisplaya12d.html?ItemName=Throwing">throwing</a>. Adding these special abilities replaces an amount of enhancement bonus equal to the ability's cost. Duplicate special abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added to it before any other weapon special abilities can be added. The benefits are decided upon when the exploit is used, and they cannot be changed unless the exploit is used again. These benefits only apply to weapons wielded by the arcanist; if another creature attempts to wield the weapon, it loses these benefits, though they resume if the arcanist regains possession of the weapon. The arcanist cannot have more than one use of this ability active at a time. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

<a href="arcanistexploitsf9fd.html?ID=58">Armored Mask</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xew?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Disciples-Doctrine">Disciple's Doctrine pg. 21</a>
Strength Normal
By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a standard action, the arcanist grants herself an effective illusion of armor. She gains the benefits of <a href="spelldisplay8272.html?ItemName=mage%20armor">mage armor</a> with a caster level that's equal to her arcanist level and appears to be wearing light or medium armor of whatever design she chooses when activating this ability. At any time while this effect is active, she can expend 1 additional point from her arcane reservoir as an immediate action to also gain the benefits of <a href="spelldisplayd440.html?ItemName=shield%20of%20faith">shield of faith</a> with a caster level equal to her arcanist level.

<a href="arcanistexploits20e2.html?ID=59"> Aspect of Innocence</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xew?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Disciples-Doctrine">Disciple's Doctrine pg. 21</a>
Strength Normal
An arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as an immediate action to gain the benefits of <a href="spelldisplay8a68.html?ItemName=innocence">innocence</a>, with a caster level equal to her arcanist level.

<a href="arcanistexploits5ced.html?ID=4">Bloodline Development</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 10</a>
Strength Normal
The arcanist selects one <a href="sorcererbloodlines.html">sorcerer bloodline</a> upon taking this exploit. The arcanist gains that bloodline's 1st-level bloodline power as though she were a 1st-level sorcerer. The arcanist must select an ordinary bloodline with this ability, not one altered by an archetype. As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to bolster her latent nature, allowing her to treat her arcanist level as her sorcerer level for the purpose of using this ability, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

She does not gain any other abilities when using this exploit in this way, such as bloodline arcana or those bloodline powers gained at 3rd level or higher. If this ability is used to gain an arcane bond and a bonded item is selected, the arcanist can only use that item to cast spells of a level equal to the level of spell that could be cast by her equivalent sorcerer level (limiting her to 1st level spells unless she spends a point from her arcane reservoir).

If the arcanist already has a bloodline (or gains one later), taking this exploit instead allows her arcanist levels to stack with the levels of the class that granted her access to the bloodline when determining the powers and abilities of her bloodline.

<a href="arcanistexploitsa378.html?ID=60"> Charmer</a> (Su)

Strength Normal
An arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a standard action to gain the benefits of <a href="spelldisplay1d6e.html?ItemName=glibness">glibness</a>, with a caster level equal to her arcanist level. The arcanist must have the aspect of innocence exploit to take this exploit.

<a href="arcanistexploits53e5.html?ID=5">Consume Magic Items</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 10</a>
Strength Normal
The arcanist can consume the power of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands, using them to fill her arcane reservoir. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Using this ability is a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity. When using this exploit, the arcanist adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell contained in the item (0-level and 1st-level spells do not recharge the arcanist's arcane reservoir). If used on a potion or scroll, the item is destroyed. If used on a wand, the wand loses 5 charges; if it has fewer than 5 charges, the wand is destroyed and the arcanist gains no benefit. If used on a staff, it loses 1 charge and the arcanist gains a number of points to his arcane reservoir equal to the level of the highest-level spell the staff can cast using only 1 charge; if the staff has no spells that require only 1 charge, the arcanist cannot consume that staff's magic. No more than 1 charge can be drawn from a staff each day in this way. Points gained in excess of the arcanist's reservoir's maximum are lost. This exploit has no effect on magic armor, weapons, rings, rods, wondrous items, or other magic items besides those noted above.


<a href="arcanistexploits3439.html?ID=6">Counterspell</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 11</a>
Strength Normal
By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the arcanist can attempt to counter a spell as it is being cast. She must identify the spell being cast as normal. If she successfully does so, the arcanist can attempt to counter the spell as an immediate action and by expending an available arcanist spell slot of a level at least one higher than the level of the spell being cast. To counterspell, the arcanist must attempt a dispel check as if using <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>. If the spell being countered is one that the arcanist has prepared, she can instead expend an available arcanist spell slot of the same level, and she receives a +5 bonus on the dispel check. Counterspelling in this way does not trigger any feats or other abilities that normally occur when a spellcaster successfully counters a spell.

<a href="arcanistexploitsc655.html?ID=7">Dimensional Slide</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 11</a>
Strength Normal
The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to create a dimensional crack that she can step through to reach another location. This ability is used as part of a move action or withdraw action, allowing her to move up to 10 feet per arcanist level to any location she can see. This counts as 5 feet of movement. She can only use this ability once per round. She does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving in this way, but any other movement she attempts as part of her move action provokes as normal.

<a href="arcanistexploitsfc86.html?ID=8">Energy Shield</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 11</a>
Strength Normal
The arcanist can protect herself from energy damage as a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. She must pick one energy type and gains resistance 10 against that energy type for 1 minute per arcanist level. This protection increases by 5 for every 5 levels the arcanist possesses (up to a maximum of 30 at 20th level).

<a href="arcanistexploits5a25.html?ID=9">Familiar</a> (Ex)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 11</a>
Strength Normal
An arcanist with this exploit can acquire a familiar as the <a href="classdisplay3fa3.html?ItemName=Wizard">arcane bond wizard class feature</a>, using her arcanist level as her wizard level to determine any of the statistics and abilities of the familiar. If the arcanist receives a familiar from another class, her levels of arcanist stack with the levels from that class when determining the familiar's statistics and abilities (this ability does not stack with a familiar gained through the bloodline development exploit; she must choose one or the other).

<a href="arcanistexploits00ce.html?ID=68">Feral Shifting</a> (Su)

As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to gain either a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 points of damage if she is Small) or two claw attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 points of damage if she is Small) for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). These are primary natural attacks.

<a href="arcanistexploits69ca.html?ID=42">First-World Face Thief</a> (Su)

Strength Normal
The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to assume an illusory disguise as <a href="spelldisplay5465.html?ItemName=disguise%20self">disguise self</a>. If she expends 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of 1, the duration of the effect increases to 10 minutes per level.

<a href="arcanistexploits6f59.html?ID=43">First-World Illusion Catcher</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy965z?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Advanced-Class-Origins">Advanced Class Origins pg. 7</a>
Strength Normal
The arcanist gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against illusions. If the arcanist successfully disbelieves an illusion, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to try to negate or steal control of the illusion. The arcanist attempts a caster level check as if she were dispelling the effect with <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>. If she succeeds, she can either end the effect or alter it as if she were the spell's caster. If the spell's duration is concentration, the arcanist must concentrate on the new effect or it ends. The arcanist must have the first-world face thief exploit to select this exploit.

<a href="arcanistexploitsf723.html?ID=10">Flame Arc</a> (Su)

Strength Normal
The arcanist can unleash an arc of flame by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This creates a 30-foot line of flame that deals 1d6 points of fire damage + the arcanist's Charisma modif ier, plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level) to each target in the line. Creatures in the area of effect may attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage.

Strength Normal
The arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to move or extinguish one 5-foot square per arcanist level of an ongoing nonmagical fire. If she chooses to move a portion of the fire, it must be moved to a square contiguous with that fire. If she also expends a spell slot of at least 3rd level when activating this ability, she can attempt to dispel a magical fire effect, as <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>.

Strength Normal
When an arcanist is on a plane other than the Material Plane, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as part of casting a spell that summons a single outsider native to that plane. If she does so, the outsider's attacks bypass all types of DR that it has. For example, a nabasu demon, which has DR/cold iron or DR/good, would bypass both DR/cold iron and DR/good.

<a href="arcanistexploits87ac.html?ID=11">Force Strike</a> (Su)

Strength Normal
The arcanist can unleash a blast of force by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This attack automatically strikes one target within 30 feet (as <a href="spelldisplay2658.html?ItemName=magic%20missile">magic missile</a>) and deals 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1 point of damage per arcanist level. Spells and effects that negate <a href="spelldisplay2658.html?ItemName=magic%20missile">magic missile</a> also negate this effect.

Strength Normal
The arcanist can unleash a jet of holy water by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. This creates a 30-foot line of water that deals damage equal to 1d8 points of damage plus the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d8 points of damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d8 at 19th level) to each target in the line that would normally take damage from holy water.

Strength Normal
The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a standard action and touch a target to grant superficial healing. This stops any bleed effects the target is suffering and grants a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, lasting for a number of hours equal to the arcanist's level. At 6th level, the number of hit points granted increases to 2d8 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier. A creature can benefit from mending flesh only once per day.

Strength Normal
The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to add a metamagic feat that she knows to a spell as she casts it without affecting the casting time (though using a higher-level spell slot as normal). She can use this ability to add a metamagic feat to a spell that she prepared using a metamagic feat, although she cannot add the same metamagic feat to a given spell more than once.

Strength Normal
By expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, an arcanist can pull a veil of shadows around her, making her more difficult to spot and strike. The arcanist gains concealment (20% miss chance) and a +5 bonus on Stealth checks. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to 1 + the arcanist's Charisma bonus.

Strength Normal
When casting a spell, the arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to make the spell being cast appear to be a different spell. The spell can be disguised as any other spell that the arcanist knows. This exploit raises the DC for a Spellcraft check to correctly identify the spell being cast by double the arcanist's caster level. Identification attempts that fail by an amount less than double the arcanist's caster level mistakenly identify the spell being cast as the false spell chosen by the arcanist.

The arcanist can tie her spells to the rigid order of Axis, giving them predictable results. As a swift action, she can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir. For the next minute, her spells deal damage as if she had rolled exactly average on all of the dice, rounded down. To find the average, treat the arcanist as if she had rolled 2-1/2 on all d4s, 3-1/2 on all d6s, 4-1/2 on all d8s, 5-1/2 on all d10s, and 6-1/2 on all d12s. For example, if a 3rd-level arcanist used this exploit and cast burning hands, the spell would deal a total of 7 points of damage.

Strength Normal
Whenever the arcanist targets one or more allies (excluding herself ) with a spell, she can expend 1 arcane point from her arcane reservoir in order to grant those allies a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell's level. These temporary hit points stack with temporary hit points from other sources, but temporary hit points from multiple uses of this exploit don't stack with each other. The temporary hit points last 1 minute per caster level or until expended.

In seeking to restore formal training in magic to the world, Old-Mage Jatembe also discovered a few methods of creating magic effects that did not follow consistent or logical rules. While his only known remaining notes on these more chaotic forms of magic are closely guarded within the Magaambya, some arcanists have either recreated his theories from vague comments on other topics or independently rediscovered the methods Jatembe first detailed. This "primal magic" can be accessed one of two ways.

The arcanist can expend 1 or more points from her arcane reservoir to create an uncontrolled primal effect. This creates an effect from the Sample Primal Magic Events table (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 13). The CR of this effect is equal to the arcanist's caster level, to a maximum caster level of 5 per point spent from her arcane reserve. In this case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to half its CR (maximum spell level 9).

Alternatively, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and expend a spell slot of at least 3rd level to create an effect as if she has used a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay7cb7.html?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod of wonder</a>. Any spell created by the <a href="magicwondrousdisplay7cb7.html?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod of wonder</a> effect uses the arcanist's spell level, rather than the spell level set by the <a href="magicwondrousdisplay7cb7.html?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod of wonder</a> table (for example a <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a> created by an 8th level arcanist rolling on the <a href="magicwondrousdisplay7cb7.html?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod of wonder</a> table would deal 8d6, rather than the listed 6d6). In this case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to the spell slot expended.

The arcanist can prepare a spell in place of an existing spell by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. Using this ability is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. The arcanist must be able to reference her spellbook when using this ability. The spell prepared must be of the same level as the spell being replaced.

Strength Normal
The arcanist can select one <a href="wizardschools.html">arcane school</a> from any of the schools available to a character with the arcane school wizard class feature, but does not have to select any opposition schools. The arcanist gains one ability of that arcane school as though she were a 1st-level wizard, using her Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier for this ability. The ability must be one gained at 1st level and is limited in its use per day to 3 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier. As a swift action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to bolster her understanding, allowing her to treat her arcanist level as her wizard level for the purpose of using this ability for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). During this time, she also gains use of the other ability gained at 1st level for her selected school. She does not gain any other abilities when using this exploit in this way, such as those gained at 8th level.

If the arcanist already has an arcane school (or gains one later), taking this exploit instead allows her arcanist levels to stack with the levels of the class that granted the arcane school when determining the powers and abilities of her arcane school.

The arcanist can see magical auras. If she expends 1 point from her arcane reservoir, for 1 minute she instantly recognizes magic item auras and spell effects (as <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a>). During this time, she is treated as if she had studied each aura for 3 rounds and she treats her Knowledge (arcana) skill check as if she had rolled a 15 on the d20. In addition, if she touches a magic item during this time, she can immediately identify its properties using Spellcraft without needing to spend 3 rounds examining the object. If an enemy possesses the object, the arcanist must first succeed at a melee touch attack to identify the item.

The arcanist can loose a deafening blast of sonic energy by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and succeeding at a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. The blast deals an amount of sonic damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus an additional 1d6 points of sonic damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). The target is also deafened for 1 minute. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to halve the damage and negate the deafness.

The arcanist can temporarily disrupt a spell by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>. This ability suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability only suppresses the spell for one creature. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability can be used on unwilling targets, but the arcanist must succeed at a melee touch attack, and the target may attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.

An arcanist with this exploit can modify the enhancements placed on a weapon, suit of armor, or shield. The arcanist can use this exploit to change one weapon or armor special ability to another with an equal cost. This ability can only be used to change the item's special abilities, not its enhancement bonus. Using this ability requires the arcanist to touch the item as a full-round action and expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir, and doing so provokes an attack of opportunity. This ability cannot be used on an item in the possession of an unwilling creature. This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to the arcanist's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The arcanist must have the arcane weapon exploit to select this exploit.

Whenever the arcanist uses the flame arc exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, each target catches on fire if it fails its saving throw. Until the fire is extinguished, the target takes 3d6 points of fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can attempt a Reflex saving throw as a full-round action to extinguish the flames. Applying at least 1 gallon of water to the target automatically extinguishes the flames.

Whenever the arcanist successfully uses the conterspell exploit, she regains a number of points to her arcane reservoir, which is determined by the level of the spell countered. Spells of 2nd level or lower do not restore any points to her arcane reservoir. Spells of 3rd and higher restore 1 point to her arcane reservoir for every three spell levels (rounded down), to a maximum of 3 points at 9th level. The arcanist must have the counterspell exploit to select this exploit.

Whenever the arcanist is using the energy shield exploit, and the shield prevents 10 or more points of damage, she can absorb a portion of that energy and use it to fuel her exploits. After absorbing the damage, she can use any exploit that deals the same type of energy damage as the type her shield absorbed, reducing the cost to her arcane reservoir by 1 point. She must use this energy within 1 minute or it is lost. The arcanist does not gain more than one such use of energy per round, and she cannot store more than one use of this energy at a time.

Whenever the arcanist uses the ice missile exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target is coated in rime if it fails its saving throw. As long as the ice remains (typically 1 minute per level in a warm area), the target is entangled (although not anchored) and takes 1 point of Dexterity damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can break free from the ice as a standard action by making a Strength check with a DC equal to 10 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier. If the target takes more than 10 points of fire damage from a single attack, the ice melts and the effect ends. The arcanist must have the ice missile arcanist exploit to select this exploit.

Whenever the arcanist uses the acid jet exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target takes additional damage on the following rounds if it fails its saving throw. The target takes 1d6 points of acid damage on the following round for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt by the initial attack. On subsequent rounds, the target continues to take 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt on the previous round. The damage continues until the amount of acid damage dealt on the previous round by this effect is 1d6. For example, a 9th level arcanist would deal 5d6 points of acid damage + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, 2d6 points of acid damage on the following round, and 1d6 points of acid damage on the third and final round. The arcanist must have the acid jet exploit to select this exploit.

The arcanist can gain control of a spell cast by another spellcaster. As a standard action by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir, the arcanist can make a caster level check opposed by the creature controlling the spell. If the arcanist is successful, she can direct the spell as a free action for 1 round, making any decisions allowed by the spell. This only functions on spells that can be directed or changed once they have been cast, such as <a href="spelldisplay85dc.html?ItemName=flaming%20sphere">flaming sphere</a> or <a href="spelldisplaybe6b.html?ItemName=spiritual%20weapon">spiritual weapon</a>. The spell returns to its owner's control at the start of the arcanist's next turn, unless the arcanist expends another point from her arcane reservoir at the start of her turn to extend the duration of control by another round. She can continue to control the spell for as long as the spell lasts, provided she keeps spending points from her arcane reservoir.

Whenever the arcanist is using the spell resistance exploit, she can end the effect as an immediate action whenever her spell resistance successfully protects her from a spell cast by a foe. If she does so, she adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell. These points are temporary and are lost after 1 minute unless used. Points gained in excess of her arcane reservoir's maximum are lost. The arcanist must have the greater spell resistance exploit to select this exploit.

When the arcanist uses the greater spell disruption exploit, she can siphon some of the power of the targeted spell to restore her arcane reservoir. If the caster level of the spell is equal to or higher than that of the arcanist, and she exceeds the DC of the dispel check by 5 or more, she adds 1 point to her arcane reservoir. If she exceeds this check by 10 or more, she instead adds 2 points to her arcane reservoir. This has no effect on magic items.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 14</a>
Strength Greater
The arcanist can steal a spell affecting one creature by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. If the creature is unwilling, she must succeed at a melee touch attack to steal the spell; the target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The arcanist can specify a spell affecting the target to steal, but if she's incorrect or doesn't know what spells are affecting the target, the spell stolen is determined randomly from all those affecting the target. If successful, the spell effect transfers to the arcanist, affecting her for the remaining duration. Unless the effect normally allows for a new saving throw during its duration (such as at the end of each round), this ability doesn't grant the arcanist a saving throw against it. The arcanist cannot use this ability to steal a spell with a range of personal or a duration of permanent. The arcanist must have the spell tinkerer exploit to select this exploit.

The arcanist can learn to cast a spell by suffering from its effects. When the arcanist fails a saving throw against a spell cast by an enemy, as an immediate action she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to temporarily acquire the spell. She can cast the spell using her spell slots as if it was a spell she had prepared that day. The spell must be on the sorcerer/wizard spell list and must be of a level that she can cast.

Arcanists experiment with ancient knowledge and mystic lore, manipulating their own natural abilities to unlock powerful arcane secrets.Despite extensive effort, not all arcanists achieve the power they seek. Some discover that their blood lacks the innate power of a sorcerer's, or that deciphering mysteries in ancient tomes requires a degree of scholarly discipline they do not have. Undeterred, such individuals continue their quest by turning to the powerful mysteries of the Outer Rifts, be they blasphemous secrets found in lost ruins, tricks of magic etched into fiendish runestones, or any other dangerous form of sinister exploitation from these horrific realms.Not all arcanists who choose this route are necessarily evil-they justify these exploits by claiming to be in control of their actions and to use the tools of their enemies against them. Nevertheless, those who bend magic using exploits from the Outer Rifts should be wary of attracting the wrong attention or enabling a greater evil than that which they seek to defeat. < h2 class="title">Arcanist Exploits

All of the following exploits can be learned by arcanists of any alignment, but these exploits come with a risk.If you use an Outer Rift exploit and in doing so reduce your arcane reservoir to 0, you immediately gain the stain of one manifestation from the accursed, demonic, hellbound, or possessed corruption.The GM chooses which corruption, manifestation, and stain you receive; this stain persists for 24 hours.Reducing your arcane reservoir to 0 in this way multiple times within a 24-hour period results in a new stain for each such instance, and each time you do so you reset the timer for all stains gained in this manner to 24 hours.At the GM's option, multiple instances of abusing exploits in this manner could result in a permanent corruption, but otherwise these corruptions are temporary and do not progress.You can never gain a gift from a corruption in this way.

Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist's exploit equals 10 + 1/2 the arcanist's class level + the arcanist's Charisma modifier.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 6</a>
Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
As a move action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to cause his eyes to turn red and weep tears of blood. During this time, the arcanist's vision is blurred by blood, and he treats all gaze attacks as if he were averting his eyes from a creature, but that creature does not gain concealment against him. At a distance of greater than 30 feet, all creatures or objects viewed by the arcanist gain concealment. As a standard action that ends the blood tears exploit, the arcanist can wipe the tears from his face and flick them with a free hand, splattering all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a Will save to avoid becoming staggered with extreme pain and anguish for 1 round. If the arcanist doesn't wipe his bleeding tears away, the effects of this exploit can persist for a maximum duration of 1 minute per arcanist level.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 6</a>
Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to manifest a choir of insidious whispers, which echo in the mind of a single target within 30 feet, urging the target to harm itself. A creature that fails a Will save to resist this effect becomes overwhelmed by the voices and succumbs to their suggestions. On its turn, it drops any objects it holds and harms itself, inflicting 1d6 points of damage. At 3rd level, and again at every 3 levels thereafter, the arcanist can target an additional creature with this exploit, to a maximum of 7 targets at 18th level. Damnation susurrus is a mind-affecting effect.

<a href="arcanistexploits450c.html?ID=54"> Fiendish Proboscis</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 6</a>
Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to grow a long, articulated proboscis covered with small spiky hairs. The appendage grows from the arcanist's face and houses a highly flexible, muscular tongue tipped with a cartilaginous barbed quill. The proboscis lasts for 1 round per arcanist level, during which time the arcanist cannot speak or use verbal components. The arcanist can end this exploit's effects early as a swift action. As a standard action, the arcanist can attack a target with the proboscis's tongue. This is a primary natural weapon with a 10-foot reach. Attacks with the tongue resolve as a touch attack. If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target's magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir's maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target's life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage. Regardless of the target's ability to use magic, the tongue's unnerving siphoning of magical or life energy causes the struck creature to become sickened for 1 round.

<a href="arcanistexploits6ed6.html?ID=55"> Rift Fog</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 6</a>
Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
As a standard action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to create a 5-foot-radius vortex of chilling fog adjacent to him. Hints of leering, fiendish faces whirl within the mist. As a move action, the arcanist can direct the cloud of rift fog to move in any direction at a speed of 30 feet to a maximum range of 60 feet from the arcanist. The fog may ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. Once the fog ends its movement, coils of its otherworldly mist surround any targets that are wholly or partially in its area. The fog's supernaturally cold temperature causes 1d6 points of cold damage to affected creatures. A creature damaged by rift fog becomes slowed (as per the <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> spell) for the following round if it fails a Will save. Once created, rift fog persists for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round), or until the arcanist activates a new exploit.

<a href="arcanistexploitse227.html?ID=79">Shadows out of Light</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 7</a>
Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to pull fiendish essence from the Outer Rifts into his own shadow. Malformed and nearly amorphous, the shadow-things swarm across his body, turning his eyes completely black and distorting his physical form. These shadows persist for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round) and grant the arcanist a +2 deflection bonus to his Armor Class. The shadows are threatening, and as long as they persist the arcanist is considered armed for the purpose of flanking or threatening an attack of opportunity. Whenever a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the arcanist, he may make the attack of opportunity with his shadow, striking as a touch attack that deals a number of points of cold damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier plus 1 point of Strength damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage. This ability does not itself increase the number of attacks of opportunity the arcanist can make in a round, but feats like <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a> do allow him to make multiple attacks of opportunity with his shadow. The shadows cannot be compelled to make normal attacks-they lash out in this way only as a reaction to being provoked.

<a href="arcanistexploitsdc21.html?ID=56">Soulrider</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 7</a>
Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
The arcanist can, as a swift action while he casts a spell that targets one living creature, spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to infuse his spell with a manifestation of fiendish energy called a "soulrider." The soulrider attaches to the target of the spell and buries itself in the target's subconscious mind, persisting there as long as the arcanist maintains at least 1 point in his arcane reservoir, until the arcanist dismisses the soulrider (this requires a standard action), or until the arcanist successfully infects another creature with a soulrider. The target of the spell can resist having the soulrider attach to its soul with a successful Will saving throw (this is in addition to any saving throw the spell itself might or might not allow). If the target resists the spell's effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell's effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim. <a href="spelldisplayd0fe.html?ItemName=Detect%20magic">Detect magic</a> and <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a> can uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect of <a href="spelldisplay4607.html?ItemName=status">status</a>, and the creature takes a -2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist. While the soulrider remains bonded to the target, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to communicate with the target as per <a href="spelldisplaya2f7.html?ItemName=sending">sending</a>. Soulrider is a mind-affecting effect.

<a href="arcanistexploitsca50.html?ID=57">Tentacles</a> (Su)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 7</a>
Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 2 points from his arcane pool to sprout a pair of rubbery tentacles that grow from his upper chest. At the same time, his arms shrink into sickly, malformed stubs, capable of only rudimentary actions such as lifting small objects or making somatic gestures. Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist's arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time. The arcanist has full control over his hideous tentacles and can use them to deliver touch spells, or as secondary natural weapons that deal tentacle damage as appropriate for a creature of the arcanist's size (1d4 for Medium arcanists, or 1d3 for Small ones) modified by 1/2 the arcanist's Strength score. The arcanist's reach with these tentacles is 5 feet longer than his normal reach.
