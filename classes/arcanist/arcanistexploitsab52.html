Strength Normal
The arcanist infuses herself with the toughness of the plant life that she studies. The arcanist can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to gain a +2 natural armor bonus and DR/slashing equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) for 1 minute per arcanist level. While this ability is in effect, she counts as both her original creature type and a plant creature for the purpose of abilities and spells.
