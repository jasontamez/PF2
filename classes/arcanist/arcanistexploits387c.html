Whenever the arcanist uses the acid jet exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, the target takes additional damage on the following rounds if it fails its saving throw. The target takes 1d6 points of acid damage on the following round for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt by the initial attack. On subsequent rounds, the target continues to take 1d6 points of acid damage for every 2d6 points of acid damage dealt on the previous round. The damage continues until the amount of acid damage dealt on the previous round by this effect is 1d6. For example, a 9th level arcanist would deal 5d6 points of acid damage + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, 2d6 points of acid damage on the following round, and 1d6 points of acid damage on the third and final round. The arcanist must have the acid jet exploit to select this exploit.
