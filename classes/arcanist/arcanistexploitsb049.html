The arcanist can twist the magic of an area, forcing primal magic events to occur there. As a standard action, she can spend 2 points from her arcane reservoir to create a 10-foot-by-10-foot area of primal magic at a point within 30 feet. The arcanist can increase the size of the area to 20-foot-by-20-foot by spending 2 additional points from her arcane reservoir. The primal magic effect remains for 1 minute.
