Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
As a standard action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to create a 5-foot-radius vortex of chilling fog adjacent to him. Hints of leering, fiendish faces whirl within the mist. As a move action, the arcanist can direct the cloud of rift fog to move in any direction at a speed of 30 feet to a maximum range of 60 feet from the arcanist. The fog may ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. Once the fog ends its movement, coils of its otherworldly mist surround any targets that are wholly or partially in its area. The fog's supernaturally cold temperature causes 1d6 points of cold damage to affected creatures. A creature damaged by rift fog becomes slowed (as per the <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> spell) for the following round if it fails a Will save. Once created, rift fog persists for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round), or until the arcanist activates a new exploit.
