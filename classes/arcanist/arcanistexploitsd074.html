Strength Greater
When the arcanist encounters a primal magic event, as an immediate action she can attempt to consume its power, as the consume spells class feature. The arcanist must succeed at a Fortitude save equal to 10 + the CR of the primal magic event, or she fails to consume the event and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. The arcanist must have the swift consume exploit to select this exploit.
