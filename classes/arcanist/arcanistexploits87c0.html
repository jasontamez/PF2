Strength Greater
Whenever the arcanist is using the energy shield exploit, and the shield prevents 10 or more points of damage, she can absorb a portion of that energy and use it to fuel her exploits. After absorbing the damage, she can use any exploit that deals the same type of energy damage as the type her shield absorbed, reducing the cost to her arcane reservoir by 1 point. She must use this energy within 1 minute or it is lost. The arcanist does not gain more than one such use of energy per round, and she cannot store more than one use of this energy at a time. The arcanist must have the energy shield exploit to select this exploit.
