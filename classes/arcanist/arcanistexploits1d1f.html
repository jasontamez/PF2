Strength Greater
Whenever the arcanist is using the spell resistance exploit, she can end the effect as an immediate action whenever her spell resistance successfully protects her from a spell cast by a foe. If she does so, she adds a number of points to her arcane reservoir equal to 1/2 the level of the spell. These points are temporary and are lost after 1 minute unless used. Points gained in excess of her arcane reservoir's maximum are lost. The arcanist must have the greater spell resistance exploit to select this exploit.
