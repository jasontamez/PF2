Bloodline Powers: While bloodraging, you gain the abilities and immunities of some aberrations, but show signs of your tainted heritage.

Staggering Strike (Su): At 1st level, when you confirm a critical hit the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. These effects stack with the Staggering Critical feat; the target must save against each effect individually.

Abnormal Reach (Su): At 4th level, your limbs elongate; your reach increases by 5 feet.

Aberrant Fortitude (Su): At 8th level, you become immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions.

Unusual Anatomy (Su): At 12th level, your internal anatomy shifts and changes, giving you a 50% chance to negate any critical hit or sneak attack that hits you. The damage is instead rolled normally.

Aberrant Resistance (Su): At 16th level, you are immune to disease, exhaustion, fatigue, and poison, and to the staggered condition.

Aberrant Form (Su): At 20th level, your body becomes truly unnatural. You are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, you gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet and your bloodrager damage reduction increases by 1. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.
