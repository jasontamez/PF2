Bloodline Powers: When you enter a bloodrage, the powers of undeath manifest, empowering your attacks with fear and your body with foul resistances.

Frightful Charger (Su): At 1st level, when you hit a creature with a charge attack, that creature becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your bloodrager level (minimum 1). This effect does not cause an existing shaken or frightened condition (from this ability or another source) to turn into frightened or panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Ghost Strike (Su): At 4th level, your melee attacks are treated as if they have the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> weapon special ability.

Death's Gift (Su): At 8th level, you gain cold resistance 10, as well as DR 10/- against nonlethal damage.

Frightful Strikes (Su): At 12th level, as a swift action once per bloodrage you can empower your melee attacks with fear. For 1 round, creatures you hit with your melee attacks become shaken. Creatures who are already shaken become frightened. At 16th level, those who are already frightened become panicked. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Incorporeal Bloodrager (Su): At 16th level, once per day you can choose to become incorporeal. You take only half damage from magic corporeal sources, and you take no damage from non-magic weapons and objects. Your attacks deal damage as normal due to your ghost strike bloodrage power.

One Foot in the Grave (Ex): At 20th level, you gain immunity to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep. The DR from your damage reduction ability increases to 8. Unintelligent undead don't notice you unless you attack them. You gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws made against spells and spell-like abilities cast by undead. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.
