While others of your kin may be powerful wizards and sorcerers, the eldritch nature of the blood coursing through your veins transforms you into a spell-breaking terror.

Bonus Feats: Combat Reflexes, Disruptive*, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Spellbreaker*. (Your bloodrager levels count as fighter levels for the purposes of qualifying for any feats marked with an asterisk [*].) This stacks with any levels in fighter you have.

Bonus Spells: <a href="spelldisplay2055.html?ItemName=Magic%20Missile">magic missile</a> (7th), <a href="spelldisplay43b6.html?ItemName=Invisibility">invisibility</a> (10th), <a href="spelldisplayc4e5.html?ItemName=Lightning%20Bolt">lightning bolt</a> (13th), <a href="spelldisplay84e4.html?ItemName=Dimension%20Door">dimension door</a> (16th)

Bloodline Powers: When you bloodrage, arcane power transforms you into an arcane juggernaut who can cut down even the most careful caster.

Disruptive Bloodrage (Su): At 1st level, the DC to cast spells defensively increases by 2 for enemies within your threatened area. This increase stacks with that granted by the <a href="featdisplay26bb.html?ItemName=Disruptive">Disruptive</a> feat.

Arcane Bloodrage (Sp): At 4th level, when entering a bloodrage you can choose one of the following spells and apply its effects to yourself: <a href="spelldisplay14e2.html?ItemName=blur">blur</a>, <a href="spelldisplayeb94.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20arrows">protection from arrows</a>, <a href="spelldisplaydcdb.html?ItemName=resist%20energy">resist energy (choose one energy type)</a>, or <a href="spelldisplay3285.html?ItemName=spider%20climb">spider climb</a>. These effects last for as long as you continue bloodraging, regardless of the spell's normal duration.

Greater Arcane Bloodrage (Sp): At 8th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can choose to apply the effects of either <a href="spelldisplayf8fb.html?ItemName=displacement">displacement</a> or <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a> to yourself. This is in addition to arcane bloodrage, and otherwise works as that ability.

Caster's Scourge (Ex): At 12th level, you gain a number of extra attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). You can use these attacks of opportunity only against spellcasters in your threatened area who cast or attempt to cast defensively. The <a href="featdisplay7d96.html?ItemName=Spellbreaker">Spellbreaker</a> feat, the caster's bane bloodrage power (see below), or some similar effect is still required to make attacks of opportunity against spellcasters who are casting defensively. You have this ability constantly, even while not bloodraging.

True Arcane Bloodrage (Sp): At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage you can choose one of the following spells and apply its effects to yourself: <a href="spelldisplaye2c7.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20IV">beast shape IV</a> (choose a creature your size or larger only), <a href="spelldisplaya1e7.html?ItemName=form%20of%20the%20dragon%20I">form of the dragon I</a>, or <a href="spelldisplay92f8.html?ItemName=transformation">transformation</a>. This is in addition to arcane bloodrage and greater arcane bloodrage, and otherwise works as those abilities.

Caster's Bane (Ex): At 20th level, spellcasters with a caster level lower than your bloodrager level always provoke attacks of opportunity within your threatened area, even when casting defensively. You have this ability constantly, even while not bloodraging.
