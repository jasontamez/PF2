The power of the elements resides in you, and at times you can hardly control its fury. This influence comes either from an elemental outsider in your family history or from a moment when you or your ancestors were exposed to a powerful elemental force or cataclysm.

Bonus Feats: Cleave, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Power Attack, Weapon Focus.

Bonus Spells: [burning hands&ast;](spell:burning hands) (7th), [scorching ray&ast;](spell:scorching ray) (10th), <a href="spelldisplayac19.html?ItemName=Protection%20from%20Energy">protection from energy</a> (13th), <a href="spelldisplay1984.html?ItemName=Elemental%20Body%20I">elemental body I</a> (16th)

Spells marked with an asterisk [&ast;] always deal a type of energy damage determined by your element, regardless of the spell's normal effects. In addition, the subtype of these spells changes to match the energy type of your element.

Bloodline Powers: One of the four elements infuses your being, and you can draw upon its power while bloodraging. At first level, you must select an element: air, earth, fire, or water. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. A number of your abilities deal damage and grant resistances based on your element, as noted below.

Element: Choose one.

Elemental Strikes (Su): At 1st level, three times a day as a swift action you can imbue your melee attacks with elemental energy. For 1 round, your melee attacks deal 1d6 points of additional damage of your energy type. At 8th level, you can use this ability up to five times per day. At 20th level, all your melee attacks deal this damage, and this ability no longer requires a swift action to activate.

Elemental Resistance (Ex): At 4th level, you gain energy resistance 10 against your energy type.

Elemental Movement (Su): At 8th level, you gain a special movement type or bonus based on your chosen element, as indicated on the above table.

Power of the Elements (Su): At 12th level, the energy damage done by your elemental strikes bloodline ability bypasses resistance to that energy type, and still deals half damage to creatures with immunity to energy of that type.

Elemental Form (Su): At 16th level, once per day when entering a bloodrage you can take an elemental form as <a href="spelldisplayd2d2-2.html?ItemName=elemental%20body%20IV">elemental body IV</a>.

Elemental Body (Su): At 20th level, elemental power surges through your body. You gain immunity to sneak attacks, critical hits, and damage from your energy type. You have this benefit constantly, even while not bloodraging.
