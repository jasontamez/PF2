At some point in your family's history, a dragon interbred with your bloodline. Now, the sublime monster's ancient power fuels your bloodrage.

Bonus Feats: Blind-Fight, Cleave, Great Fortitude, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Fly), Toughness.

Bonus Spells: <a href="spelldisplay018e.html?ItemName=Shield">shield</a> (7th), <a href="spelldisplay9230.html?ItemName=Resist%20Energy">resist energy</a> (10th), <a href="spelldisplay7085.html?ItemName=Fly">fly</a> (13th), <a href="spelldisplay4fa2.html?ItemName=Fear">fear</a> (16th)

Bloodline Powers: The power of dragons flows through you and manifests in a number of ways. At 1st level, you must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. A number of your bloodline powers deal damage and grant resistances based on your dragon type, as noted below.

Dragon: Choose one.

Claws (Su): At 1st level, you grow claws. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d6 points of damage each (1d4 if you are Small) plus your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At 12th level, these claws deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of your energy type on a hit.

Draconic Resistance (Ex): At 4th level, you gain resistance 5 against your energy type and a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. At 8th level, your energy resistance increases to 10 and your natural armor bonus increases to +2. At 16th level, your natural armor bonus increases to +4.

Breath Weapon (Su): At 8th level, you gain a breath weapon that you can use once per day. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of your energy type per bloodrager level. Those caught in the area of the breath can attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. The shape of the breath weapon depends on your dragon type (as indicated on the above table). At 16th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day.

Dragon Wings (Su): At 12th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can choose to have leathery wings grow from your back, giving you a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. At 16th level, your fly speed increases to 80 feet with good maneuverability.

Dragon Form (Su): At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can choose to take the form of your chosen dragon type (as <a href="spelldisplay630b.html?ItemName=form%20of%20the%20dragon%20II">form of the dragon II</a>, but with average or good maneuverability, as you would gain from the dragon wings bloodrage power above).

Power of Wyrms (Su): At 20th level, you gain immunity to paralysis, sleep, and damage from your energy type. You also gain blindsense with a range of 60 feet. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.

Expanded Bloodlines

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nfl?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-Dragons">Legacy of Dragons pg. 4</a>
Chromatic and metallic dragons remain the most common dragons to impart their legacy onto other species. The bloodrager and sorcerer classes each include a draconic bloodline that assumes the character's lineage is somehow connected with the power of a chromatic or metallic dragon. Presented below are expanded options for the existing draconic bloodlines, increasing the selection of heritages to include the numerous new true dragons presented in the many Pathfinder RPG Bestiary volumes. Each of the draconic bloodlines below alters the bloodrager's or sorcerer's bloodline arcana.

Energy Types: Several of these new draconic bloodline options include nonstandard damage types. For the sake of game balance, many of the damage types available to the bloodlines below somewhat differ from those produced by the parent dragon. Specifically, force energy, negative energy, and sonic energy have been altered to different types of energy. In cases where a dragon's energy type is listed as physical damage (such as bludgeoning or piercing), use that damage type when determining your breath weapon damage. For the purpose of the dragon resistance bloodline power, you gain DR equal to half the energy resistance you would normally gain against all attacks of that specific damage type. A character with the power of wyrms bloodline power gains immunity to her bloodline's damage type. For all other purposes, such as archetypes, bloodline powers, and feats, treat that dragon's energy type as fire.


Esoteric Dragons

Though many of the enigmatic esoteric dragons remain aloof or intentionally distant from mortal affairs, occult dragons are the most likely to imprint their bloodline onto humanoids. Often such draconic blood is the result of ongoing experimentation. Scions of other esoteric dragons are far more unusual; such bloodlines usually result from explorers traveling the realms where these distant dragons dwell and being exposed to some spectacular and illunderstood power.

Variant Bloodline Arcana: When selecting spells known, you can choose spells from the psychic class spell list (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 69). The psychic spells you select must normally be unavailable to your class. You can know only a number of psychic spells equal to the highest level spell you can cast from your class spell list, based on your current class level. When you're casting these spells, they function as psychic magic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components (Occult Adventures 144) instead of verbal and somatic components when casting these spells.

Imperial Dragons

The blood of imperial dragons is well known throughout the lands of Tian Xia, where such dragons form a strong part of much of the continent's mythology. This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes.

Variant Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell that affects a creature with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, increase the spell's save DC by 1.

Outer Dragons

The interests of outer dragons take them across the cosmos. Strange devices or experimentation are most likely to lead to the addition of outer dragon blood into a world's ecosystem. The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation's residents.

Variant Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, if a creature is damaged by the spell, that creature cannot take a 5-foot step for 1 round. This effect occurs only when you're using spells that require an attack roll (such as <a href="spelldisplay1e46.html?ItemName=chill%20touch">chill touch</a> or <a href="spelldisplayd694.html?ItemName=scorching%20ray">scorching ray</a>) or spells that allow a save (such as <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a> or <a href="spelldisplay68b4.html?ItemName=lightning%20bolt">lightning bolt</a>). A successful save against the damage or effects of the spell also negates this additional effect.

Primal Dragons

Born from the elemental planes or the Shadow Plane, primal dragons are infused with primeval power. These dragons traveled to the Material Plane in ages past, and many of their kind continue to spread their blood and magical influence among the humanoid races of the world. Even the malign umbral dragons prosper in the caverns of the Darklands and the mountains of Nidal. Any exposure to or experimentation with primal magics may introduce primal dragon blood into a lineage.

Variant Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your draconic bloodline's energy type, you can reroll a number of damage dice equal to half the spell's level.
