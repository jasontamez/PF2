Dares - Gunslinger









Gunslinger Dares


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide</a>
Dares are similar to deeds in that they grant a gunslinger or a swashbuckler extra abilities based on either grit or panache, but unlike deeds, dares become active when a member of these classes runs out of her respective pool, and become inactive until the character regains points of their respective pool. They grant the character a benefit and a new ability to regain or increase the ability to regain either grit or panache.

A dare can be taken in place of one of the bonus feats a gunslinger or a swashbuckler gains at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A gunslinger or a swashbuckler can choose to have multiple dares, but can only pick one to be active each time she reaches 0 grit or panache points. Once chosen, the active dare cannot be changed until the gunslinger or swashbuckler reaches 0 grit or panache points again.

The following gunslinger dares can be used by swashbucklers.


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Desperate Evasion (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 94</a>): While this dare is active, you gain the evasion class feature. If you already have this class feature, while this dare is active you roll twice when making a Reflex saving throw and take the higher result. You regain 1 grit or panache point when you succeed at two Reflex saving throws while using this dare.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frantically Nimble (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 94</a>): While this dare is active, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. You regain 1 grit or panache point when any enemy making a ranged or melee attack against you misses you three consecutive times. The attacks need not come from the same enemy.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Out for Blood (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 94</a>): While this dare is active, your critical threat range with firearms (for gunslingers) or light or onehanded piercing melee weapons (for swashbucklers) increases by 1 (20/x4 becomes 19-20/x4, 19-20/x2 becomes 18-20/x2, and so on). This effect does not stack with similar effects that modify a weapon's critical threat range.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Run Like Hell (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 94</a>): While this dare is active, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you retain your Dexterity bonus to your AC while running. You regain 1 grit or panache point the first time you are more than 100 feet away from your closest enemy.</td>
