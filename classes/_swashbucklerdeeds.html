Swashbuckler Deeds


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide</a>
Swashbucklers spend panache points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the swashbuckler a momentary bonus or effect, but some provide longerlasting effects. Some deeds remain in effect while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, but do not require expending panache to be maintained. A swashbuckler can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the swashbuckler has or spends the required number of panache points to perform the deed.



1st-level Deeds


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Derring-Do (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 56</a>): At 1st level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point when she makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check. She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dodging Panache (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 57</a>): At 1st level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet; doing so grants the swashbuckler a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modif ier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. This movement doesn't negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original square. This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 57</a>): At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the swashbuckler, she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The swashbuckler makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a -2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature's result, the creature's attack automatically misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature's attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.</td>

3rd-level Deeds


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Kip-Up (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 57</a>): At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can kip-up from prone as a move action without provoking an attack of opportunity. She can kip-up as a swift action instead by spending 1 panache point.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Menacing Swordplay (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 57</a>): At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, when a swashbuckler hits an opponent with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can choose to use Intimidate to demoralize that opponent (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 99) as a swift action instead of a standard action.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Precise Strike (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 57</a>): At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, a swashbuckler gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon (though not natural weapon attacks), adding her swashbuckler level to the damage dealt. To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her off hand or use a shield other than a  buckler. She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit.

As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike's damage bonus on the next attack. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of panache points a deed costs (such as the <a href="featdisplay1554.html?ItemName=Signature%20Deed">Signature Deed</a> feat).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Swashbuckler Initiative (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 58</a>): At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, if she has the Quick Draw feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and she has any single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that isn't hidden, she can draw that weapon as part of the initiative check.</td>

7th-level Deeds


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Superior Feint (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 58</a>): At 7th level, a swashbuckler with at least 1 panache point can, as a standard action, purposefully miss a creature she could make a melee attack against with a wielded light or one-handed piercing weapon. When she does, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC until the start of the swashbuckler's next turn.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Swashbuckler's Grace (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 58</a>): At 7th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she takes no penalty for moving at full speed when she uses Acrobatics to attempt to move through a threatened area or an enemy's space.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Targeted Strike (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 58</a>): At 7th level, as a full-round action the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to make an attack with a single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that cripples part of a foe's body. The swashbuckler chooses a part of the body to target. If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted. If a creature doesn't have one of the listed body locations, that body part cannot be targeted. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to targeted strikes. Items or abilities that protect a creature from critical hits also protect a creature from targeted strikes. <ul><li>Arms: The target takes no damage from the attack, but it drops one carried item of the swashbuckler's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet cannot be chosen.</li><li>Head: The target is confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li><li>Legs: The target is knocked prone. Creatures with four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.</li><li>Torso or Wings: The target is staggered for 1 round.</li></ul></td>

11th-level Deeds


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Bleeding Wound (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 58</a>): At 11th level, when the swashbuckler hits a living creature with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon attack, as a free action she can spend 1 panache point to have that attack deal additional bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage dealt is equal to the swashbuckler's Dexterity modif ier (minimum 1). Alternatively, the swashbuckler can spend 2 panache points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage instead (swashbuckler's choice). Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Evasive (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 11th level, while a swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she gains the benefits of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her swashbuckler level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Subtle Blade (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 11th level, while a swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she is immune to disarm, steal, and sunder combat maneuvers made against a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon she is wielding.</td>

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Dizzying Defense (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 15th level, while wielding a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon in one hand, the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to take the f ighting defensively action as a swift action instead of a standard action. When f ighting defensively in this manner, the dodge bonus to AC gained from that action increases to +4, and the penalty to attack rolls is reduced to -2.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Perfect Thrust (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can as a full-round action make a perfect thrust, pooling all of her attack potential into a single melee attack made with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. When she does, she makes the attack against the target's touch AC, and ignores all damage reduction.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Swashbuckler's Edge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can take 10 on any Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check, even while distracted or in immediate danger.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Cheat Death (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 19th level, whenever the swashbuckler is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, she can spend all of her remaining panache to instead be reduced to 1 hit point. She must have at least 1 panache point to spend. Effects that kill the swashbuckler outright without dealing hit point damage are not affected by this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Deadly Stab (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 19th level, when the swashbuckler conf irms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, in addition to the normal damage, she can spend 1 panache point to inf lict a deadly stab. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or die. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the swashbuckler's level + the swashbuckler's Dexterity modif ier. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not grant the swashbuckler a panache point.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stunning Stab (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 59</a>): At 19th level, when a swashbuckler hits a creature with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can spend 2 panache points to stun the creature for 1 round.

Deeds of Renown


Description Source: <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends</a>
Swashbucklers and gunslingers perform impressive deeds through their grit and panache, but some are capable of truly spectacular acts known as renowned deeds. A swashbuckler or gunslinger (though not members of other classes) can select a renowned deed for her class upon reaching the class level listed in the deed's description. This replaces the specific listed deed or deeds; if the character would not gain the appropriate deeds, she cannot select the renowned deed, as if selecting an archetype.



Swashbuckler Renowned Deeds


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Vengeful Heart (Ex) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 5</a>): Some swashbucklers are driven by vengeance above all else. At 1st level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's resolve class feature, treating her swashbuckler level as her samurai level. Whenever the swashbuckler spends a use of resolve, she must also spend a point of panache or a use of charmed life, or the use of resolve has no effect. This deed replaces the derring-do deed and one other 1st-level deed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hilt Hammer (Ex) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 5</a>): Precise strikes with a slender blade do little to hinder amorphous or incorporeal creatures; when encountering such threats, some swashbucklers abandon precision in favor of brutish strikes. At 3rd level, the swashbuckler can activate this deed before rolling the attack roll when making an attack that would benefit from precise strike. An attack altered this way deals only half the normal damage from precise strike, but this damage is not treated as precision damage. This deed alters (but does not replace) the precise strike deed and replaces one other 3rd-level deed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dodging Dance (Ex) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 5</a>): The swashbuckler moves around her opponents' attacks to open them up for strikes. At 7th level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to move up to half her speed as a move action. If a creature makes an attack of opportunity against her due to this movement, she can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC equal to the attacking creature's CMD. If she succeeds, the attack of opportunity misses, and the swashbuckler can make an attack of opportunity against the attacking creature instead. She can attempt to evade multiple attacks of opportunity during this movement, but the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 2 for each additional opponent that makes an attack of opportunity against her during this movement. If the swashbuckler has an ability that grants her additional attacks of opportunity, she can use them to respond to multiple missed attacks of opportunity with her own attacks. This deed replaces the swashbuckler's grace deed and one other 7th-level deed.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Vengeful Soul (Ex) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 5</a>): Sometimes vengeance can take years or even decades, forcing the aggrieved swashbuckler to push the limits of her endurance. At 11th level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's greater resolve class feature. At 19th level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's true resolve class feature. The swashbuckler must have the vengeful heart renowned deed to select this deed. This deed replaces the subtle blade and cheat death deeds, plus an additional 11th-level deed.</td>
