Diviners are masters of remote viewing, prophecies, and using magic to explore the world.

Forewarned (Su): You can always act in the surprise round even if you fail to make a Perception roll to notice a foe, but you are still considered flat-footed until you take an action. In addition, you receive a bonus on initiative checks equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1). At 20th level, anytime you roll initiative, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

Diviner's Fortune (Sp): When you activate this school power, you can touch any creature as a standard action to give it an insight bonus on all of its attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum +1) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Scrying Adept (Su): At 8th level, you are always aware when you are being observed via magic, as if you had a permanent detect scrying. In addition, whenever you scry on a subject, treat the subject as one step more familiar to you. Very familiar subjects get a -10 penalty on their save to avoid your scrying attempts.

Associated School: Divination.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the diviner's fortune and scrying adept powers of the divination school.

Prescience (Su): At the beginning of your turn, you may, as a free action, roll a single d20. At any point before your next turn, you may use the result of this roll as the result of any d20 roll you are required to make. If you do not use the d20 result before your next turn, it is lost. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Foretell (Su): At 8th level, you can utter a prediction of the immediate future. While your foretelling is in effect, you emit a 30-foot aura of fortune that aids your allies or hinders your enemies, as chosen by you at the time of prediction. If you choose to aid, you and your allies gain a +2 luck bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, and skill checks. If you choose to hinder, your enemies take a -2 penalty on those rolls instead. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Prophets who specialize in arcane magic often claim specialty in manipulating the powers of luck to their advantage.

Associated School: Divination.

Replacement Powers: The following replace the forewarned and scrying adept powers of the divination school.

Inspiring Prediction (Su): A number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier, you can predict an ally's success, bolstering others' resolve. As a swift action, you can shout an inspiring prediction, granting each ally within 50 feet who can hear you a +4 luck bonus on her next attack roll, saving throw, or skill check.

In Accordance with the Prophecy (Su): A number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier, you can publicly declare that your next spell is guided by prophecy. When you do, the next spell you cast has a 20% chance of fizzling (1-20 on a d%). If the spell does not fail, treat the spell as if it had been modified by the Empower Spell feat, even if you do not have that feat. At 12th level, the chance that the spell fizzles is reduced to 15% (1-15 on a d%). At 16th level, the chance is reduced to 10% (1-10 on a d%)

You can see or hear (not both) through this sensor for number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1).
