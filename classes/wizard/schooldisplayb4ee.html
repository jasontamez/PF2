Fire (Elemental School)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 142</a>
The fire elementalist sees a world around him that is made to burn, and he can bring that fire to consume his foes. He has also learned that fire can purify and protect, if properly controlled.

Fire Supremacy (Su): You gain resistance 5 to fire. At 10th level, this resistance increases to 10. At 20th level, you gain immunity to fire damage. In addition, whenever you are within 5 feet of a source of flame at least as large as a campfire, you can draw the fire around you for 1 round as a swift action. Anyone striking you with a melee weapon or unarmed strike takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). Weapons with reach avoid this damage.

Fire Jet (Su): As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line of fire. Anyone in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess. A successful Reflex save halves this damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their saving throw catch fire and take 1d6 points of fire damage on the following round. Creatures that catch fire can avoid this damage by taking a full-round action to extinguish the flames by making a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the ground gives a +2 circumstance bonus on the save. Dousing the creature with water automatically extinguishes the flame. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Dancing Flame (Su): At 8th level, as a standard action, you can sculpt fire to suit your desires. With one use of this ability you can move any nonmagical fire up to 30 feet. Alternatively you can use this ability to alter any fire spell that you cast with a duration of instantaneous by removing any number of squares from its area of affect. If the fire spell has a duration, you can use this ability to reposition the spell, within its original range (treat this as if you had just cast the spell, even though the duration is unchanged). You cannot use this ability on a fire spell that you did not cast. If you move a nonmagical flame, it must have a new source of fuel. If it does not, it is extinguished in one round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

Magma School

Associated School: Earth or Fire.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the acid cloud and earth glide powers of the earth school and the fire jet and dancing flame powers of the fire school.

Magma Furrow (Su): As a standard action, you can send forth a 20-foot line of magma. Any creature in this line takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every 2 wizard levels you have. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) halves this damage. In addition, the ground in this area remains molten for another 1d4 rounds. Creatures that begin their turns in the area can move out that turn without penalty, but those that enter the area each take 1d6 points of fire damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Lava Shield (Su): At 8th level, you can create a barrier of lava to protect you for 1 round as a standard action. Choose one edge of your space. That edge is treated as a solid wall for attacks targeting you only. You gain total cover from attacks that pass through this edge, and you gain the benefits of fire shield (warm shield) while adjacent to the lava shield. You can dismiss the lava shield as a free action, and it disappears immediately if you leave your space. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to half your wizard level.

Smoke School

Associated School: Air or Fire.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the lightning flash and cyclone powers of the air school and the fire jet and dancing flame powers of the fire school.

Smokesight (Su): You can see normally through natural fog and smoke, as well as any fog and smoke that you (but not others) magically create. A number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence bonus, you can touch another creature as a standard action to grant it this vision for 1 hour.

Body of Smoke (Sp): At 8th level, you can assume a gaseous form (as per the spell of that name) as a swift action for a number of minutes per day equal to your wizard level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
