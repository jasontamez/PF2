Greed

A phantom with this focus voraciously coveted gold, gems, and hedonistic possessions in life. Such phantoms are still obsessed with hoarding wealth and project that avarice onto the spiritualists to whom they are bonded. Their coloration tends toward yellow, and the sound of jangling coins sometime manifests when they attack.

Skills: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Appraise and Sleight of Hand equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

Good Saves: Fortitude and Reflex.

Eye of Avarice: The phantom adds half its number of Hit Dice (minimum 1) as a bonus on its Appraise checks. While it is confined to the spiritualist's consciousness, when the spiritualist attempts to identify the properties of a magic item using detect magic, the phantom grants the spiritualist this bonus on Spellcraft check.

Ruthless Combatant (Su): A phantom with this focus threatens a critical hit with its slam attacks on a result of 19-20. At 11th level, its critical multiplier with slam attacks increases to ??3.

Assume Effect (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, when she casts a spell on herself with a range other than personal, the spell can also affect her phantom. The phantom can benefit from this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day when the spiritualist reaches 12th level and a third time when the spiritualist reaches 19th level.

Covetous Aura (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, as a swift action the phantom can emit a 20-footradius aura that exemplifies its covetous nature. The aura lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to the phantom's Hit Dice. These rounds need not be used consecutively, and the phantom can dismiss its covetous aura as a free action. Whenever a harmless (so noted by a spell's saving throw description) spell of 2nd level or lower is cast by a creature within the covetous aura, the phantom can immediately gain the benefit of that spell as if the spell had also targeted it. The intended target still gains the effect of the spell.

Take It with You (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, whenever the phantom is reduced to 0 hit points, a number of harmless spells affecting the phantom equal to the phantom's Charisma modifier are immediately transferred to the spiritualist for the remainder of their duration. If desired, the spiritualist can transfer only some (or none) of the spells affecting the phantom.
