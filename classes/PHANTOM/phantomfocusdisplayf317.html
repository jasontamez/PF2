Whimsey

Phantoms with this emotional focus carry a simplistic, childlike wonder and are fond of games and playing tricks. Whimsical phantoms are often the ghosts of gnomes; in the case of bleachling spiritualists, the phantom may even be a psychic vestige of the bleachling's own lost childlike nature. Among other races, most phantoms with the whimsy focus are the spirits of those who died as children and carried their childlike nature into the afterlife.

Skills: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Perception equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

Good Saves: Reflex and Will

Tricky Combatant: A phantom with the whimsy focus gains <a href="featdisplay9292.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirty%20Trick">Improved Dirty Trick</a> as a bonus feat, even if it does not meet the prerequisites.

Colorful Burst (Sp): Once per day, a phantom with this focus can produce an explosion of bright colors in a 15-foot cone. This functions as the spell <a href="spelldisplayc403.html?ItemName=color%20spray">color spray</a>, except that creatures with fewer HD than the phantom are treated as if they had 2 HD or less, creatures with HD equal to that of the phantom are treated as if they had 3 or 4 HD, and creatures with more HD than the phantom are treated as if they had 5 or more HD. A creature can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier).

Aura of Laughter (Sp): When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can emit a 10-foot aura of childish laughter as a swift action. Enemies within the aura are distracted by the laughter, taking a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls and a -5 penalty on Perception checks. This ability has no effect on creatures that cannot hear.

Telekinetic Prankster (Sp): When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom gains the ability to use limited telekinesis to trip up its foes. It can perform combat maneuvers against creatures up to 15 feet away. When doing so, it can use its Charisma modifier in place of its Strength modifier on its combat maneuver checks.

Invoke Laughter (Sp): When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can cause nearby creatures to fall into fits of uncontrollable laughter. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the phantom must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or begin laughing uncontrollably, as the spell <a href="spelldisplayb793.html?ItemName=hideous%20laughter">hideous laughter</a>. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.
