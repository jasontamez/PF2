No phantom is as arrogant as a pride phantom, which in life was an insufferable braggart and egotist. These phantoms often puff and posture while fighting, shouting brash taunts and paeans to their own supposed skill in all things. Pride phantoms are often a roiling green in color.

Skills: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Intimidate and in Perception equal to its number of Hit Dice. While the phantom is confined within the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

Good Saves: Reflex and Will.

Resolve: A phantom that has this emotional focus is immune to fear effects. However, when the phantom fails an ability check, skill check, or attack roll, it loses this immunity for 1 hour. Multiple failed checks or rolls are not cumulative. Instead, they simply reset the hour of lost immunity.

Flagrant Disregard (Ex): As a swift action, the phantom can gain a +2 bonus on all attack rolls while taking a -1 penalty to AC for 1 round. For every 4 points of base attack bonus the phantom has, this bonus on attack rolls increases by 1 and the penalty to AC increases by 1.

Vainglorious Oration (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can espouse bold lies about its own prowess as a swift action to cause enemies to become shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet of the phantom and able to hear it. This effect persists as long as the enemy is within 30 feet (the phantom can end the oration as a free action). This ability cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the target was already shaken from another effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components.

Overwhelming Confidence (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, as long as the phantom is immune to fear effects from its resolve ability, any morale bonuses affecting the phantom are doubled. If the phantom loses its immunity to fear, all doubled morale bonuses that are affecting the phantom are instead applied as penalties for the remainder of their duration or until the phantom regains its immunity to fear (whichever comes first).

Illusion of Perfection (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the greed phantom can shroud itself in an illusion as a swift action, appearing as a model of absolute physical perfection-its idealized image of itself. The phantom gains a bonus on melee damage rolls equal to its Charisma modifier. However, whenever the phantom deals damage to a creature, the creature can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the effect, reducing the bonus on damage rolls by half if successful. The phantom can use illusion of perfection for a number of minutes per day equal to its Hit Dice. This duration need not be used all at once, but must be expended in 1-minute intervals. This ability is a mind-affecting illusion effect.
