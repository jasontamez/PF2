Free in Body - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay24bf.html?ItemName=Free%20in%20Body">Free in Body</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 44</a>): When constrained, the subject can easily slip loose. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins its turn grappled or under an effect that impedes its movement (including paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web). The subject gains the benefits of freedom of movement for 1 minute.

This is a masterful trick.
