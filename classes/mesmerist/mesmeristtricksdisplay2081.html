Psychic Impression - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay2081.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Impression">Psychic Impression</a>(<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 9</a>): Objects retain psychic impressions of those who come in contact with them, and a powerful mind can read these impressions. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject touches an object that another creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or more has touched in the last 10 minutes. The mesmerist receives a psychic impression of the emotional state of the last such creature to touch the object. This impression contains no images or languages and can't show the mesmerist who the creature was if the mesmerist doesn't already know.
