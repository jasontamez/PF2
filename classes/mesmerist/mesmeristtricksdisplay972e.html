Reflect Fear - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay972e.html?ItemName=Reflect%20Fear">Reflect Fear</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 16</a>): The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a fear effect or is the target of an Intimidate check to demoralize it. When the trick is triggered, the subject suppresses the fear effect that triggered the trick for 1d4 rounds, and any creature that caused this effect must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the effect's duration. If the duration of the reflect fear trick is longer than the fear effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the fear effect at all.
