Slip Bonds - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay23e9.html?ItemName=Slip%20Bonds">Slip Bonds</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 12</a>): While implanted with this trick, the subject gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks. If the subject becomes grappled, pinned, shackled, or otherwise personally restrained, the mesmerist can trigger the trick and cause the subject to become incorporeal just long enough to slip her bonds (unless they can otherwise restrain an incorporeal creature). This effect doesn't last long enough for the subject to move through walls or other barriers. If the mesmerist is 12th level, the subject remains incorporeal until the beginning of the mesmerist's next turn.
