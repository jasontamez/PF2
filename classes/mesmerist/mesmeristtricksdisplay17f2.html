Fearsome Guise - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay17f2.html?ItemName=Fearsome%20Guise">Fearsome Guise</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 40</a>): A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as disguise self. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.
