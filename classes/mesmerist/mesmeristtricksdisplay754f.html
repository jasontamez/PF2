Telepathic Link - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay754f.html?ItemName=Telepathic%20Link">Telepathic Link</a>(<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 9</a>): The subject can communicate telepathically with the mesmerist during a crisis. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject and her allies are outnumbered in combat. For 1 minute per mesmerist level, the subject and the mesmerist can communicate telepathically. If the subject and the mesmerist are more than a medium distance (100 feet + 10 feet per level) apart, the telepathic connection is severed and cannot be regained unless the trick is implanted again. The mesmerist and the subject must share a language to be able to communicate.
