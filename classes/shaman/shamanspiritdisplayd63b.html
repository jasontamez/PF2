A shaman who selects the lore spirit appears far wiser and knowing that her age would suggest. Though she can seem unassuming, her eyes give the impression she is peering deep into all she looks at, seeing the secrets of the essential merely by concentrating.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit can select from the following hexes.

Arcane Enlightenment (Su): The shaman's native intelligence grants her the ability to tap into arcane lore. The shaman can add a number of spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to the list of shaman spells she can prepare. To cast these spells she must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level, but the saving throw DCs of these spells are based on her Wisdom rather than Intelligence. When she casts these spells, they are treated as divine rather than arcane. Each time the shaman gains a level after taking this hex, she can choose to replace one of these spells for a new spell on the wizard/sorcerer spell list.

Benefit of Wisdom (Ex): The shaman relies on wisdom rather than intellect to gain and retain knowledge. She can use her Wisdom modifier instead of her Intelligence modifier on all Intelligence-based skill checks.

Brain Drain (Su): As a standard action, the shaman violently probes the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 30 feet. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it succeeds, it immediately knows the source of the mental prying; otherwise, it's wracked with pain and takes 1d4 points of damage for every 2 levels the shaman possesses. On the round following her successful use of this ability, the shaman can take a fullround action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim's bonus with that skill. The random stolen thoughts remain in the shaman's mind for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and she can treat the knowledge gained as if she used detect thoughts. This is a mind-affecting effect. Once she successfully affects a creature, she cannot use this hex on that creature again for 24 hours.

Confusion Curse (Ex): The shaman's command of lore can cause weaker minds to become mired in confusion. The shaman chooses a single intelligent target within 30 feet. That creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or become confused for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Once affected by this hex, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Share Knowledge (Su): The shaman targets a single willing ally within 30 feet and shares her knowledge and experience with that target for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier. During that time, the subject knows the languages that the shaman does and uses the shaman's skill modifier on all Knowledge checks instead of its own. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal appears to be quiet and unassuming. It gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks.

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Monstrous Insight (Su): The shaman can identify creatures and gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. As a standard action, the shaman can attempt a Knowledge skill check to identify a creature and its abilities (using the appropriate skill for the monster's type) with an insight bonus equal to her shaman level. Whether or not the check is successful, she also gains a +2 insight bonus for 1 minute on attack rolls made against that creature and a +2 insight bonus to her AC against attacks made by that creature. These bonuses last for 1 minute. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Automatic Writing (Su): Once per day, the shaman can spend 10 minutes in uninterrupted meditation to tap into greater understanding. During this period, her hands produce mysterious writings pertaining to the future. This writing takes the form of divination with 90% effectiveness. The shaman can use this ability an additional time per day at 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Perfect Knowledge (Ex): The shaman gains the benefit of the tongues spell permanently. She also gains a +10 competence bonus on all Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft checks.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes an unending font of knowledge and lore. She can take 20 on all Knowledge skill checks, including those she isn't trained in. Her understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of reality has also become so advanced that she can cast wish once per day. This doesn't require a material component, but the wish cannot be used to grant ability score bonuses or replicate spells with expensive material components.
