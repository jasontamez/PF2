A shaman who selects the life spirit appears more vibrant than most mortals. Her skin seems to glow, and her teeth are a pearly white. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, her eyes and hair shimmer in the light.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Life spirit can select from the following hexes.

Curse of Suffering (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to take more damage from bleed effects and causes its wounds to heal at a slower rate. When the cursed creature takes bleed damage, it takes 1 additional point of bleed damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Furthermore, when the target is subject to an effect that would restore its hit points, that effect restores only half the normal amount of hit points. This curse lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Deny Succor (Su): The shaman can place this hex on a single creature within 30 feet. The target does not heal damage from cure spells and does not benefit from any spells or effects that remove conditions. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the saving throw is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Enhanced Cures (Su): When the shaman casts a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on her shaman level, not the limit imposed by the spell. For example an 11th-level shaman with this hex can cast cure light wounds to heal 1d8+11 hit points instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.

Life Link (Su): The shaman creates a bond between herself and another creature within 30 feet. Each round at the start of the shaman's turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and the shaman takes 5 points of damage. The shaman can have one bond active per shaman level. The bond continues until the bonded creature dies, the shaman dies, the distance between her and the bonded creature exceeds 100 feet, or the shaman ends it as an immediate action. If the shaman has multiple bonds active, she can end as many as she wants with the same immediate action.

Life Sight (Ex): The shaman can see the states of life, death, and general health of those around her. When she uses this ability, she can tell whether or not creatures within 30 feet of her that she can see are living, wounded, dying, or dead. She can also tell if those creatures are confused, disabled, diseased, nauseated, poisoned sickened or staggered. At 12th level, when using life sight she is able to sense all nearby living creatures; this functions similar to blindsight, but only for living creatures within 30 feet of her. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to consecutive.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal appears to be a beautiful and very healthy version of its species, and seems especially vibrant and full of life. Her animal companion gains fast healing 1 (Bestiary 300); if the spirit animal already has fast healing, instead its fast healing increases by 1.

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Channel (Su): The shaman can channel positive energy like a cleric, using her shaman level as her effective cleric level when determining the amount of damage healed (or dealt to undead) and the DC. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Healer's Touch (Su): The shaman gains a +4 bonus on Heal checks. As a standard action, the shaman can move up to half her speed and touch up to six dying creatures. Each creature is automatically stabilized without the need of a Heal check.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Quick Healing (Su): The shaman calls upon her spirit to enhance the speed of her healing abilities. This ability allows her to channel positive energy or cast a cure spell as a swift action. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a perfect channel for life energy. She gains immunity to bleed, death attacks, and negative energy, as well as to the exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, and sickened conditions. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce her to below 1 in any ability score. She automatically succeeds at saving throws against massive damage. When she is reduced to below 0 hit points, she doesn't die until her negative hit point total exceeds double her Constitution score.

Restoration

Associated Spirit: Life

Spirit Magic Spell: Remove sickness replaces the life spirit's 1st-level spirit magic spell.

Replacement Hexes: The following life spirit hexes replace the curse of suffering and deny succor hexes that a shaman can select from the life spirit.

Shell of Succor (Su): The shaman surrounds one touched creature with a ward of succoring energy, granting the target a number of temporary hit points equal to her Wisdom bonus + an additional 1d6 temporary hit points per 2 shaman levels she has (maximum 10d6). These temporary hit points last a number of minutes equal to the shaman's level.

The target always loses these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points (including those from a kineticist's force ward defense wild talent). If an attack deals fewer points of damage than the target's temporary hit points from this shell of succor ability, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss. The shaman can use this hex a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma bonus.

Spirit Boost (Su): Whenever the shaman casts a healing spell that heals a target up to its maximum hit points, any excess hit points persist for 1 round per shaman level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to the shaman's level).

True Spirit Ability: The following true spirit ability replaces the quick healing ability of the life spirit.

Spirit of Life (Su): The shaman's spirit animal transforms into a conduit of life energy able to store succoring magic that can keep the shaman's allies safe. This allows the spirit animal to cast stabilize as a spell-like ability at will using the shaman's level as the spell's caster level. In addition, the shaman can transfer any cure spell (a spell with "cure" in its name) she casts to her spirit animal as a swift action, provided that the spirit animal is within 30 feet of her. This functions like imbue with spell ability, except a spirit animal can be imbued with a cure spell of any spell level that its master can cast regardless of the spirit animal's Intelligence or Wisdom score. The spirit animal can hold the spell indefinitely, but the shaman cannot prepare a new spell in the imbued spell's spell slot until her spirit animal uses the spell or it is slain, or until she dismisses the imbue with spell ability effect (a free action). A spirit animal can be imbued with only one spell at a time in this manner. If the spirit animal is slain while it is imbued with a cure spell, that spell is lost.
