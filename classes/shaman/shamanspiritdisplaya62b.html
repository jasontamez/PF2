Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Tribe spirit can select from the following hexes.

Curse of Faltering (Su): As an immediate action when an enemy within 30 feet threatens a critical hit, the shaman can force the creature to reroll its original attack roll with a penalty equal to the shaman's Charisma modifier. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this ability. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours. This is a curse effect.

Curse of Isolation (Ex): The shaman makes an enemy within 30 feet keenly feel its status outside the tribe. For a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level, the target gains no benefit from flanking or the aid another action, and it doesn't benefit from morale bonuses. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this ability. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours. This is a curse effect.

Steadfast Example (Su): The shaman touches a willing creature and bolsters its mental and emotional defenses. The next time the target attempts a Will saving throw, the subject can use the shaman's Will saving throw bonus instead of his own. The shaman can have only one creature under the effect of this hex at a time, and a creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Threatening Coordination Hex (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to view the shaman's allies as obstacles. The target treats squares adjacent to the shaman's allies as difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level, or for 1 round if the target succeeds at a Will saving throw. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature affected by this hex cannot be the target of it again for 24 hours.

Touch of Succor (Su): The shaman can touch a willing creature as a standard action to remove one of the following conditions: fatigued, shaken, or sickened. At 8th level, she adds confused and frightened to the list of conditions she can remove. At 12th level, she also adds dazed, nauseated, and panicked. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her shaman level.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal has colorations or markings that resemble a totem or important symbol for the shaman's tribe. When the spirit animal successfully performs the aid another action, the bonus it provides increases by 1.

Tribal Cooperation (Su): The shaman gains a <a href="feats0beb.html?Category=Teamwork">teamwork feat</a> as a bonus feat. She must meet the feat's prerequisites. As a standard action, the shaman can grant one of her teamwork feats to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear her. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every 2 levels the shaman has. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of this bonus feat. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.
