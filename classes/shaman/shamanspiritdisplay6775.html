A shaman who selects the mammoth spirit is abnormally tall and stocky, with thick shaggy hair. When she uses a special ability of this spirit, her muscles ripple and flex, and her stature seems even greater than before. At times, particularly when she uses her most powerful abilities, a ghostly image of a mammoth may seem to rise around her as a visible aura of ghostly power.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Mammoth spirit can select from the following hexes.

Burden of the Beast (Su): This ability works as the lodestone ability of the stone spirit.

Mammoth's Hide (Su): The shaman can touch a willing ally and cause its skin to thicken and sprout thick, shaggy fur. The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to natural armor and cold resistance 5 for 10 minutes. At 9th level, the enhancement bonus increases to +3 and the cold resistance to 10. At 15th level, this enhancement bonus increases to +4 and the cold resistance to 15. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma bonus.

Phantom Stampede (Su): The shaman summons a host of ghostly herd beasts to trample a single creature. These phantom beasts affect only the target creature, which is buffeted and pummeled by their passing. The creature takes no damage from the ability, but takes a -4 penalty to its CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. Additionally, spellcasters under the effect of this ability take a -4 penalty on concentration checks. The target receives no saving throw to negate this effect. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. The creature can't be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Primal Speaker (Ex): The shaman can speak with mammoths and any other megafauna or elephant creatures as if she were under the effects of speak with animals. At 5th level, the shaman gains a bonus on Handle Animal checks when dealing with those animals equal to half her shaman level. At 10th level, the shaman can affect one such animal within 30 feet as if she-d cast charm animal (Will negates). Whether or not the target succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Thunder Foot (Ex): The shaman's body thickens and becomes more muscular. For the purpose of the overrun combat maneuver, she treats her shaman level as her base attack bonus when calculating her CMB and CMD. At 7th level, the shaman gains Improved Overrun as a bonus feat. At 11th level, the shaman gains Greater Overrun as a bonus feat. The shaman doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these feats.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal appears more primal and prehistoric than an ordinary animal of its kind. It gains a +2 inherent bonus to its Strength score. The spirit animal loses this bonus when it manifests as a megafauna companion from the true spirit ability (see page 133).

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Mammoth spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Powerful Smash (Ex): As a standard action, the shaman can attack an enemy with an unarmed strike as if she had the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. If the shaman hits a creature in this way, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the shaman's class level + her Charisma modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Mammoth spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Strength of the Beast (Ex): The shaman gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Strength score. This bonus increases by 2 every 6 shaman levels thereafter (at 14th and 20th levels for her spirit, and at 18th level for her wandering spirit).

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Mammoth spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Megafauna Companion (Su): The shaman's spirit animal transforms into a megafauna animal companion, using the shaman's shaman level as her effective druid level. The shaman must choose an arsinoitherium, baluchitherium, brontotherium, chalicotherium, deinotherium, elasmotherium, glyptodon, mastodon, megaloceros, megatherium, uintatherium, or another mammalian megafauna (including most dire animals) that has animal companion statistics. It retains its Intelligence score and the special abilities it gains from the spirit animal class feature, but it also has the statistics and abilities of an animal companion. If the animal companion is dismissed, lost, or dies, it can be replaced in the same way as a normal spirit animal.

Manifestation: At 20th level, the shaman can transform into any animal listed under the megafauna or elephant heading. This ability works as per beast shape IV, but the shaman can activate and dismiss the ability as often as she likes and the duration is permanent.
