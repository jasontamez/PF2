A shaman who selects the heavens spirit has eyes that sparkle like starlight, exuding an aura of otherworldliness to those she is around. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, her eyes turn pitch black and the colors around her drain for a brief moment.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Heavens spirit can select from the following hexes.

Enveloping Void (Su): The shaman curses one creature with the dark void. As a standard action, the shaman can cause one enemy within 30 feet to treat the light level as two steps lower: bright light becomes dim light, normal light becomes darkness, and areas of dim light and darkness become supernaturally dark (like darkness, but even creatures with darkvision cannot see). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Guiding Star (Su): Whenever the shaman can see the open sky at night, she can determine her precise location and can add her Wisdom modif ier to her Charisma modifier on all Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, once per night while outdoors, she can cast one spell as if it were modified by the Empower Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell feat without increasing the spell's casting time or level. The shaman doesn't need to possess the feat to use this ability.

Heaven's Leap (Su): The shaman is adept at creating tiny tears in the fabric of space, and temporarily stitching them together to reach other locations through a limited, one-way wormhole. As a standard action, the shaman can designate herself or a single ally that she can see who is within 30 feet of her. She can move that creature as if it were subject to jester's jaunt. Once targeted by this hex, the ally cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Lure of the Heavens (Su): The shaman's connection to the skies above is so strong that her feet barely touch the ground. At 1st level, she no longer leaves tracks. At 5th level, she can hover up to 6 inches above the ground or liquid surfaces. At 10th level, the shaman gains the ability to fly (as the spell) for a number of minutes per day equal to her shaman level-the duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

Starburn (Su): As a standard action, the shaman causes one creature within 30 feet to burn like a star. The creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage for every 2 levels the shaman possesses and emits bright light for 1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw halves the damage and negates the emission of bright light. The shaman can use this hex a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but must wait 1d4 rounds between uses.

Spirit Animal: The flesh of the shaman's spirit animal accurately reflects the stars that would be visible in the night sky, no matter where the animal is or the time of day. Due to this, it can be used as a star map. In addition, it gains a fly speed of 5 feet; if the animal already has a fly speed, instead its fly speed increases by 10 feet. While the animal is flying, a small nimbus of light surrounds it.

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Heavens spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Stardust (Sp): As a standard action, the shaman causes stardust to materialize around one creature within 30 feet. This stardust causes the target to shed light as a candle, and it cannot benefit from concealment or any invisibility effects. The creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks. This penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of -6 at 20th level. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the shaman's level (minimum 1). Sightless creatures cannot be affected by this ability. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Heavens spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Void Adaptation (Su): The shaman gains darkvision 60 feet. If she already possesses darkvision, the range instead increases by 30 feet. In addition, the shaman can see in supernatural darkness, is constantly under the effects of endure elements, and doesn't need to breathe.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Heavens spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Phantasmagoric Display (Sp): The shaman can cast prismatic wall and prismatic spray, each once per day with a caster level equal to her shaman level.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes the spirit of heaven. She receives a bonus on all saving throws equal to her Wisdom modif ier. She automatically stabilizes if she is reduced to below 0 hit points. She's immune to fear effects, and she automatically confirms all critical hits she threatens. If she dies, she's reborn 3 days later in the form of a star child, maturing over the course of 7 days (as reincarnate).
