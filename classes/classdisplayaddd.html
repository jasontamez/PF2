Drake

Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nfl?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-Dragons">Legacy of Dragons</a>
A drake can be a powerful ally to one who understands how to deal with its surly and obstinate attitude. Such a character is called the drake's "charge," as drakes refuse to refer to another being as their master. While drake companions enjoy accumulating hoards of shiny treasure, they adamantly refuse to wear barding, armor, or clothing items of any kind (belts, boots, and so on); they can wear magical jewelry such as amulets or rings but will agree to wear only one such item. Drake companions are not animal companions and don't count as animal companions for any purpose, including Handle Animal checks and tricks. Additionally, they are fairly lazy, and successful Diplomacy or Intimidate checks are needed to convince them to fatigue themselves or take major risks to their lives. Without the mount drake power (see page 24), a drake companion actively refuses to suffer a rider and fights a rider it has not agreed to every step of the way, even if that rider is its charge. Drake companions are extreme oddities among drakes and irreplaceable to their charges, as it takes years to win a drake's trust. As such, should a drake companion die, her charge doesn't gain a replacement drake companion and must restore the companion from the dead. At the GM's discretion, a charge who lost his drake might be able to bond with a new drake after going on a quest to find another special drake and spending several years bonding with the new drake.

BAB: This is the base attack bonus of the drake, which is equal to its number of Hit Dice.

Saves: These are the drake's base saving throw bonuses.

Skills: This entry lists the drake's total number of skill ranks. A drake with a high Intelligence score modifies this total as normal (for each Hit Die it has, it gains a number of skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier). A drake can't have more ranks in a skill than it has HD

Feats: This is the drake's total number of feats.

Special: As the drake increases in power, it gains the special abilities described below.

Darkvision (Ex): The drake has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

Low-Light Vision(Ex): Drakes see twice as far as humans in dim light.

Immunities: Drakes are immune to sleep and paralysis.

Subtype: Each drake has an energy or elemental subtype, either aether, air, cold, earth, fire, or water, and gains a free drake power based on its subtype. When their charges reach 1st level, aether drakes gain magic attacks, air drakes gain glide, earth drakes gain burrow, and water drakes gain swim. When their charges reach 3rd level, fire drakes gain breath weapon (fire) and cold drakes gain breath weapon (cold).

Drake Power: The drake gains a power for which it qualifies from the list of drake powers on page 23. Each power can be chosen only once.

Natural Armor: The drake's natural armor bonus to its AC increases by 2 when the charge reaches 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter.

Ability Score Increase (Ex): The drake adds 1 to one of its ability scores when its charge reaches 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter

Size Increase: The drake matures further and advances a size category when the charge reaches 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Each time this occurs, the drake's natural armor bonus to its AC increases by 2, its natural attacks increase in damage based on the new size category, and it gains the following ability scores adjustments: Str +4, Dex -2, Con +2. When the drake reaches Medium size, its speed increases from 20 feet to 30 feet.

Drake Powers

Drake companions can select from the following drake powers.

Aether Bite: The drake's bite applies 1-1/2 ?? its Strength modifier to the damage dealt by its bite attack, and its bite attack deals full damage to incorporeal creatures. To select aether bite, a drake must have the aether subtype and the drake's charge must be at least 7th level.

Blindsense: The drake gains blindsense out to a range of 10 feet. To select blindsense, a drake must have scent and the drake's charge must be at least 11th level.

Breath Weapon: The drake chooses acid, cold, electricity, or fire, and gains a breath weapon it can use once per day that fires a glob of the chosen energy up to 60 feet. It deals 4d6 points of damage of the appropriate type in a 10-foot-radius spread (Reflex half; DC = 10 + 1/2 the drake's Hit Dice + the drake's Constitution modifier).

Breath Weapon, Greater: The drake's breath weapon has a 20-foot radius, deals 8d6 points of damage, and can be used five times per day (though it must wait 1d4 rounds between uses). To select this, a drake must have breath weapon and improved breath weapon and its charge must be at least 15th level.

Breath Weapon, Improved: The drake's breath weapon has a 15-foot radius, deals 6d6 points of damage, and can be used three times per day (though it must wait 1d4 rounds between each use). To select improved breath weapon, a drake must have breath weapon and its charge must be at least 11th level

Burrow: The drake gains a burrow speed of 10 feet.

Burrow, Improved: The drake's burrow speed improves to 30 feet. To select improved burrow, a drake must have burrow and the earth subtype and its charge must be at least 7th level.

Energy Bite: The drake's bite deals 1d6 extra points of damage of the same energy type as its breath weapon. To select energy bite, a drake must have breath weapon and the cold or fire subtype and its charge must be at least 7th level.

Flight : The drake gains a fly speed of 40 feet (clumsy). To select flight, a drake must have glide and its charge must be at least 7th level.

Flight, Greater: The drake's fly speed improves to 80 feet (good). To select greater flight, a drake must have glide, flight, improved flight, and the air subtype and its charge must be at least 15th level.

Flight, Improved: The drake's fly speed improves to 60 feet (average). To select improved flight, a drake must have glide and flight and its charge must be at least 11th level.

Glide: The drake is able to take ranks in Fly. It can slow its fall to 60 feet per round, and it takes no falling damage as long as it can take actions and succeeds at a DC 15 Fly check each round. As it falls, it can take a move action to move up to 30 feet laterally in a straight line, or two move actions to move up to 60 feet laterally in a straight line. The drake can't gain height while gliding.

Intellect: The drake's Intelligence score increases by 4.

Keen Mind: The drake's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores each increase by 2. A drake must have intellect to select keen mind.

Magic Attacks: The drake's attacks count as magic.

Mount: The drake deigns to allow its charge to ride it, as long as she is at least one size category smaller than the drake. While carrying a rider, the drake can't burrow and it loses the benefits of the highest-level drake power it has from the following list (ordered from highest-level to lowest-level): greater flight, improved flight, flight, or glide. To select mount, a drake must have glide and its charge must be at least 7th level.

Mount, Improved: The drake accepts any rider of the charge's choice who is at least one size category smaller than the drake (provided the rider remains in the drake's good graces), and it no longer loses a flight-based drake power when carrying a rider. To select this power, a drake must have glide and mount and its charge must be at least 11th level.

Scent: The drake gains the scent ability.

Swim: The drake gains a 20-foot swim speed.

Swim, Improved: The drake's swim speed improves to 60 feet. To select improved swim, a drake must have swim and the water subtype and its charge must be at least 7th level.
