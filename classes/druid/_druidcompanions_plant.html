Animal Companions








Plant Companions

Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness</a>
Plant companions have a variety of different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant companion attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant companion attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions can't gain armor or weapon proficiency feats even as they advance in Hit Dice, and they can't use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise.

As you gain levels, your plant companion grows in power as well, gaining the same bonuses that are gained by animal companions. Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each companion choice.

Plant companions are typically suitable only for specific archetypes, such as the treesinger druid archetype, but with the GM's permission, any druid could select a plant companion.

Trip: Because many plant companions have several rootlike legs, they are very difficult to trip. As a result, a CMD entry has been included for each, indicating the bonus to CMD such plants receive against trip attacks.
