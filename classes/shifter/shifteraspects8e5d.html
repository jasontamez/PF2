Aspects - Shifter









Aspects


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness</a>
A shifter draws her primary strength from an association with a specific type of animal. As a result, when a shifter uses her shifter aspect or wild shape class features, she can assume only the forms of her chosen aspects. Until reaching 5th level, a shifter has only a single aspect, but as she increases in level, she gains more control over her metamorphosis, allowing her to take on multiple aspects and even merge aspects.

All shifter aspects have a minor form and a major form. The minor form grants a shifter a few of the animal's physical traits, while the major aspect is the form she takes on when she uses wild shape to fully transform into an animal. The list of abilities gained with the major aspect include those gained from the wild shape class feature, but the benefits gained from any resulting changes to size are not listed here (see <a href="spelldisplayab2d.html?ItemName=Beast%20Shape%20II">beast shape II</a>).

The following options represent only the most common choices used by shifters. Other aspects based on different animals certainly exist, and might grant similar powers or entirely new abilities based on the animal's themes and nature. You can use the following aspects as guides for developing aspects of your own design, but if you wish to do so, you must secure your GM's permission.

Shifters with a vermin aspect, such as dragonfly or spider, assume these major aspects with <a href="spelldisplayd43b.html?ItemName=Vermin%20Shape%20II">vermin shape II</a> rather than <a href="spelldisplayab2d.html?ItemName=Beast%20Shape%20II">beast shape II</a>.


Alternate Natural Attacks


A shifter can draw on her chosen animal aspect to transform her hands into deadly weapons, as represented by the shifter's claws class feature, but not every animal has prominent claws. The following list provides alternate natural attacks for the shifter claws class feature. Each time the shifter activates her shifter's claws ability in her natural form, she can manifest one of the alternate natural attacks listed below for any of her chosen aspects, or those that relate to her archetype. Each alternate natural attack replaces one of the shifter's claw attacks. The shifter can gain up to two different alternate natural attacks with this method. These alternate natural attacks modify only the damage type of the shifter's natural attacks and otherwise function exactly as the shifter claws class feature.

Lions hunt in prides, cooperating to bring down large opponents and defend their territory. A lion's alternate attack is bite (B, P, S).

Minor Form: You gain a +4 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.

Major Form (<a href="spelldisplayab2d.html?ItemName=Beast%20Shape%20II">beast shape II</a>): Your shape changes to that of a <a href="monsterdisplay238b.html?ItemName=Dire%20Lion%20(Spotted%20Lion)">dire lion</a>. While in this form, you gain a base speed of 40 feet, low-light vision, and scent (30 feet). Once per day for every 2 shifter levels you have, you can utter a mighty roar, allowing you to attempt an Intimidate check with a +5 circumstance bonus to demoralize enemies within 30 feet. Allies gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures affected by this ability. At 8th level, you gain one of the following teamwork feats as a bonus feat: <a href="featdisplay9665.html?ItemName=">Outflank</a>, <a href="featdisplay7a0f.html?ItemName=Pack%20Attack">Pack Attack</a>, <a href="featdisplay102a.html?ItemName=Paired%20Opportunists">Paired Opportunists</a>, or <a href="featdisplay0c7c.html?ItemName=Shake%20It%20Off">Shake It Off</a>. You can grant allies within 30 feet the benefits of this feat as a swift action for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. At 15th level, you provide a flanking bonus to any ally who threatens the same opponent as you do, and you can change places with an adjacent ally as a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, as if using the <a href="featdisplay10dc.html?ItemName=Swap%20Places">Swap Places</a> feat.
