Deities: Gozreh, Rovagug.

Storm Strike (minor): At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and grant it a blessing of stormy weather. For 1 minute, this weapon glows with blue or yellow sparks and deals an additional 1d4 points of electricity damage with each hit. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the shock or shocking burst weapon special abilities.

Wind Barrier (major): At 10th level, you can create a barrier of fast winds around yourself for 1 minute. This acts as a wind wall on all sides of your square, protects you with feather fall, and doesn't interfere with your ranged attacks.
