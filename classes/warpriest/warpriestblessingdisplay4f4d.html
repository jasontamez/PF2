Unholy Strike (minor): At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and give it an evil blessing. For 1 minute, this weapon takes on a black, orange, or violet cast and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against good creatures. During this time, it's treated as evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the unholy weapon special ability.

Battle Companion (major): At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as summon monster IV with a duration of 1 minute, but for only an evil outsider or an animal with the fiendish creature simple template. This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the summon monster spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 20th level).
