Deities: Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae.

Powerful Healer (minor): At 1st level, you can add power to a cure spell as you cast it. As a swift action, you can treat any cure spell as if it were empowered (as the Empower Spell feat), causing it to heal 50% more damage (or deal 50% more damage if used against undead). This ability doesn't stack with itself or the Empower Spell feat.

Fast Healing (major): At 10th level, you can touch an ally and grant it fast healing 3 for 1 minute.

Associated Blessing: Healing

Replacement Blessing: The following minor blessing replaces the powerful healer ability of the Healing blessing.

Ameliorating Touch (Minor): At 1st level, your touch is a balm to your suffering allies. You can touch an ally as a swift action to temporarily relieve that ally of the fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition. This blessing suppresses those conditions for 1 minute. At 2nd level, you can spend two uses of your blessing ability whenever you heal yourself or an ally with your fervor class ability to use this minor blessing as a free action instead of a swift action.

Associated Blessing: Healing

Replacement Blessing: The following major blessing replaces the fast healing ability of the Healing blessing.

Return of the Fallen (Major): At 10th level, your touch can defy the cold claws of death itself. You can temporarily revive a touched ally to continue fighting, as if you had cast raise dead on her. The revived ally is also staggered for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your warpriest level, after which she immediately dies. The ally is free to act as she sees fit during this time, and you are granted no control over her.
