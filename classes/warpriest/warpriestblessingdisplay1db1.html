From the Grave (minor): At 1st level, you can take on a corpse-like visage for 1 minute, making you more intimidating and giving you undead-like protection from harm. You gain a +4 bonus on Disguise checks to resemble an undead creature and on Intimidate checks, as well as a +2 profane bonus on saving throws against disease, mindaffecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun.

Death's Touch (major): At 10th level, you can make a melee touch attack against an opponent to deliver grim suffering. If you succeed, you inflict 1 temporary negative level on the target for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can activate this ability as a swift action upon hitting an opponent with a melee attack. These temporary negative levels stack. You gain no benefit from imposing these negative levels (such as the temporary hit points undead gain from enervation).
