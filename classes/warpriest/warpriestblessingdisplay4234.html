Strength Surge (minor): At 1st level, as a swift action you can focus your own strength. You gain an enhancement bonus equal to 1/2 your warpriest level (minimum +1) on melee attack rolls, combat maneuver checks that rely on Strength, Strength-based skills, and Strength checks for 1 round.

Strength of Will (major): At 10th level, as a swift action you can ignore the movement penalties caused by wearing medium or heavy armor or by carrying a medium or heavy load. This effect lasts for 1 minute. During this time, you can add your Strength modifier on saving throws against effects that would cause you to become entangled, staggered, or paralyzed.
