Double (minor): At 1st level, as a move action you can create an illusory double of yourself. This double functions as a single mirror image, and lasts for a number of rounds equal to your warpriest level, or until the illusory duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. You can have no more than one double at a time. The double created by this ability doesn't stack with the additional images from the mirror image spell.

Greater Invisibility (major): At 10th level, as a swift action you can become invisible for 1 round (as greater invisibility).
