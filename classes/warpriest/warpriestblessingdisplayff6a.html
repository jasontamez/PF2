Deities: Evil deities that offer the Air blessing or nonevil deities with disasters in their portfolios

Dust Devil (minor): When you hit with a weapon attack, you can use a swift action to cause a sudden burst of wind and debris to swirl around your target. The target is dazzled for 1 minute.

Howling Gale (major): At 10th level, you can invoke a howling windstorm around yourself as a standard action. For 1 minute, any Large or smaller creature takes twice as much movement to enter a space adjacent to you due to the winds, and thus can't take a 5-foot step to move adjacent to you.
