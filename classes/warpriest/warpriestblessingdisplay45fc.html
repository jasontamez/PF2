Blast Rune (minor): At 1st level, you can create a blast rune in any adjacent square. Any creature entering this square takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 your warpriest level. This rune deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, designated when you create the rune. The rune is invisible, and lasts a number of rounds equal to your warpriest level or until discharged. You cannot create a blast rune in a square occupied by another creature. This rune counts as a 1st-level spell for the purposes of dispelling. It can be discovered with a successful DC 26 Perception skill check and disarmed with a successful DC 26 Disable Device skill check.

Spell-Storing Weapon (major): At 10th level, you can cast a spell into a magic weapon as if it had the spell storing weapon special ability. If the stored spell is not used within 10 minutes, it dissipates.
