Deities: Abadar, Torag.

Acid Strike (minor): At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with acidic potency. For 1 minute, this weapon emits acrid fumes that deal an additional 1d4 points of acid damage with each strike. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the corrosive weapon special ability.

Armor of Earth (major): At 10th level, you can touch an ally and harden its armor or clothing. For 1 minute, the ally gains DR 1/-. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, this DR increases by 1 (to a maximum of DR 5/- at 18th level). This doesn't stack with any other damage resistance.
