Deities: Asmodeus, Sarenrae.

Fire Strike (minor): At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with the grandeur of fire. For 1 minute, this weapon glows red-hot and deals an additional 1d4 points of fire damage with each hit. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the flaming or flaming burst weapon special abilities.

Armor of Flame (major): At 10th level, you can touch an ally to wreath it in flames. This works as fire shield (warm shield only) with a duration of 1 minute.
