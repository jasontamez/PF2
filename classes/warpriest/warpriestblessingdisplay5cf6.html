Scaly Touch (minor): At 1st level, you can touch an ally as a standard action to grant it reptilian scales. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +1 enhancement bonus to its natural armor. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).

Serpent Fang (major): At 10th level, as a standard action you can manifest venomous fangs for 1 minute. These fangs grant a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (for a Medium warpriest, 1d3 if Small). A successful bite also aff licts the opponent with a debilitating venom. The poison's save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your warpriest level + your Constitution modifier.

Serpent Venom (Ex): Bite-injury; save Fort negates; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 1 save.
