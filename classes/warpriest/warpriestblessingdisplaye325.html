Deities: Calistria, Desna, Shelyn.

Lucky Presence (minor): At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it a lucky presence. The target of this luck can call upon it to roll any one ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check twice and take the better result. The decision to use this ability must be made before the roll is made. Once used, or once 1 minute passes, the effect ends.

Unlucky Enemy (major): At 10th level, as an immediate action you can force an adjacent opponent to reroll an attack, saving throw, or skill or ability check it just attempted; it must take the lower of the two rolls. You must declare this after the roll is made but before the result is revealed.
