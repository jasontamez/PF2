Deities: Lamashtu.

Madness Supremacy (minor): At 1st level, as a swift action you can target a creature within 30 feet that has the cowering, frightened, panicked, or paralyzed condition. That condition is suspended for 1 round, and the chosen creature gains the confused condition instead. The confused creature rerolls any result other than "attack self - or -attack nearest creature." The round spent confused counts toward the duration of the suspended effect. At the end of the confused round, the suspended condition resumes.

Control Madness (major): At 10th level, as a swift action you can choose one behavior for all confused creatures within 30 feet to exhibit (as if all creatures rolled the same result). This effect lasts for 1 round. You can use this ability even while you are confused.
