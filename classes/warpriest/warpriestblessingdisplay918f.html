Deities: Erastil, Gozreh.

Creeping Vines (minor): At 1st level, upon hitting with a melee attack, as a swift action you cause the creature you hit to sprout entangling vines that attempt to hold it in place, entangling it for 1 round (Reflex negates).

Battle Companion (major): At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as summon nature's ally IV, with a duration of 1 minute. This ability can summon only one animal, regardless of the list used, and the creature's type changes to plant instead of animal. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the summon nature's ally spell increases by 1, to a maximum of summon nature's ally IX at 20th level.
