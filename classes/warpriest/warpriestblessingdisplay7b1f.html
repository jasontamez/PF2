Charming Presence (minor): At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant an entrancing blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her opponents, filling them with either abject admiration or paralyzing fear. This effect functions as sanctuary, except if the ally attacks an opponent, the effect ends with respect to only that opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Dominance Aura (major): At 10th level, you can surround yourself with a tangible aura of majesty for 1 minute. While this aura is active, once per round as a swift action you can issue a command (as the command spell) to one creature within 30 feet; the creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or submit for 1 round.
