Deities: Evil deities that offer the Earth blessing or nonevil deities with disasters in their portfolios

Stone's Base (minor): You can touch an ally to bless it with the stalwart resilience of stone. For 1 minute, the creature gains a +4 bonus to its CMD against maneuvers that would move the ally or knock it prone.

Earth Hammer (major): At 10th level, you can touch a weapon to bless it with the force of a mighty earthquake for 1 minute. When the weapon hits a creature, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone; either way, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours.
