Oaths - Paladin







Oath of Chastity

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 62</a>
A chaste paladin proves her purity by way of her action and her abstinence from romantic activities. Many believe that this oath is only about sex, but it is really an oath about the romantic notion that a single person could be more important than all the evils facing the world-it is this perceived selfishness that the bearer of the Oath of Chastity strives to reject. In doing so, she gains purifying power.

Pure of Mind (Su):  At 2nd level, the paladin gains a +4 sacred bonus on saves against charm effects and figments, and gains a bonus equal to her Charisma modifier on Will saving throws. This ability replaces divine grace.

Pure of Body (Su):  Upon reaching 8th level, the paladin has a 50% chance to turn any critical hit or sneak attack against her into a normal hit, as if she were wearing fortification armor. This ability replaces aura of resolve.

Code of Conduct:  Never engage in a romantic relationship or a sexual act.

Oath Spells:  1st-remove fear; 2nd-confess; 3rd-heroism; 4th-freedom of movement.
