For paladins of the Eternal Rose, beauty is synonymous with virtue, and it is the lens through which all goodness is filtered. For champions of Shelyn, who are aware that aesthetics is subjective, beauty is the form inviolate.

Beauty Unyielding (Su): At 3rd level, a paladin gains spell resistance equal to 11 + her paladin level, but only against non-harmless transmutation effects. This spell resistance can be lowered as a standard action. Additionally, whenever the paladin would take Charisma damage or suffer Charisma drain, she reduces the amount of damage or drain by 1 (minimum 0). This ability replaces divine health.

Restore True Beauty (Su): At 14th level, a paladin can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability to attempt to dispel any non-harmless transmutation effect on a target, as break enchantment. Additionally, the paladin can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability to remove all of the target's temporary Charisma damage and restore all points drained from its Charisma score, as restoration. This ability replaces aura of faith.

Code of Conduct: Respect the innate beauty in all things, and strive to preserve it from corruption and perversion. Never willfully cause damage to crafted objects or works of art, nor cause a creature or object to be deformed in any way.

Oath Spells: 1st-sanctuary; 2nd-make whole; 3rd-banish seeming; 4th-true form.
