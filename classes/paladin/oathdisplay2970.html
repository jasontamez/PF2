Oath of the Skyseeker

The dwarven people look to the legendary Sky Citadels as beacons of dwarven culture. Paladins with the oath of the skyseeker swear to defend those citadels their people retain and to help reclaim those the dwarves have lost, hoping to one day rebuild them on the greatest, most honorable ideals of the dwarven gods.

Deities: Angradd, Folgrit, Kols, Torag, Trudd.

Smite Evil Hordes (Su): When the paladin or an ally defeats the target of the paladin's smite evil ability, the paladin can change the target of her smite to a different target within 30 feet of the previously defeated target without using an action. The new target must be of the same creature type and subtype as the previous target. If no applicable target is within 30 feet, then the smite evil effect ends. The paladin's smite does not deal more damage to evil outsiders, dragons, or undead than to other evil creatures.

This ability alters smite evil.

Divine Bond (Su): At 5th level, the paladin adds mighty cleaving to the list of weapon special abilities that can be added to her weapon and removes flaming from the list.

This ability alters divine bond.

Mercy for the Lost (Sp): At 11th level, the paladin can use the Sky Citadels as a beacon leading her on the path to her deity. If she is on the Material Plane, the paladin can use find the path once per day at her paladin level, but only to find her way to a known Sky Citadel. If she is not on the Material Plane, she can instead use this ability to use plane shift as per the spell to travel to a known Sky Citadel. If she is in a Sky Citadel, she can expend her daily use of this ability to use plane shift to travel to the realm of her deity.

This ability replaces aura of justice.

Stalwart (Ex): At 14th level, the paladin's quest has strengthened her body and mind. If she succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an effect that has a reduced effect on a successful save, she instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless paladin does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.

This ability replaces aura of faith.

Code of Conduct: Reclaim a Sky Citadel in the name of honorable dwarven ideals. Defend Sky Citadels already held by dwarves.

Oath Spells: 1st-enlarge person; 2nd-find traps; 3rd-spiritual ally; 4th- blessing of fervor.
