Variant Divine Bonds

Although all paladins commune with divine forces and celestial spirits, some are able to do so in ways that transcend the typical martial blessing or celestial servitor. When a paladin gains the divine bond class feature, she can choose one of the following variant divine bonds instead of those outlined by her class. All variant divine bonds are supernatural abilities, and a paladin cannot choose a variant divine bond if she has an archetype that alters or replaces divine bond.

<tr>
<td>Agathion Bond (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nd4?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Healers-Handbook">Healer's Handbook pg. 25</a>): As a standard action, the paladin can call forth an agathion spirit that bonds to her healing hands for 1 minute per paladin level, causing her to manifest physical traits evocative of one kind of agathion. This bond allows the paladin to add her Charisma bonus to the amount of hit points that she restores with her spells, her lay on hands ability, and her channel energy ability. For every 3 levels beyond 5th, she restores 1 additional hit point with those abilities, up to a maximum of 5 + her Charisma modifier at 20th level. The paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, up to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</td>

<td>Angelic Bond (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nd4?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Healers-Handbook">Healer's Handbook pg. 25</a>): As a standard action, the paladin can call forth an angel spirit that bonds to her, causing her to manifest a resplendent halo. This bond allows the paladin to shine light as per continual flame for 1 minute per paladin level. Additionally, while the halo shines, all allies within 20 feet gain the benefits of protection from evil, except the deflection and resistance bonuses are +3. For every 3 levels she has beyond 5th, the deflection bonus and resistance bonus provided by this effect increases by 1, up to a maximum of +8 at 20th level. The paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, up to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Archon Bond (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nd4?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Healers-Handbook">Healer's Handbook pg. 25</a>): As a standard action, the paladin can call forth an archon spirit that bonds to her brow, causing her eyes to glow with righteous fury for 1 minute per paladin level. While this bond is active, any hostile creature within a 10-foot radius of the paladin that looks at her must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 her paladin level + her Charisma modifier) or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws and to AC for 24 hours. Whether or not the saving throw is successful, a creature cannot be affected by the same paladin's archon bond again for 24 hours, and the penalties from multiple archon bonds don't stack. Creatures that don't have eyesight are not affected by this ability. For every 3 levels beyond 5th, the radius of the paladin's archon bond increases by 5 feet, up to a 35-foot radius at 20th level. The paladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, up to a total of four times per day at 17th level.</td>
