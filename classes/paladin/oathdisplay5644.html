The Eagle Knights and the people of Andoran hold their elected officials to extremely high standards of conduct. Paladins swearing the oath of the People's Council serve the common good by finding and thwarting those who abuse their authority. Many seek specifically to emulate Talmandor, the agathion patron of Andoran.

Deities: Abadar, Erastil, Iomedae, Ragathiel, Shelyn, Vildeis.

Skills: The oathbound paladin's class skills include Linguistics, Perception, and Perform, but not Handle Animal, Ride, or Spellcraft.

Stirring Monologue (Su): At 1st level, the paladin can deliver a stirring monologue on the ideals of justice and fairness, motivating allies and persuading others. This functions as bardic performance as per a bard of her paladin level using Perform (oratory). All the effects are language-dependent even if they would not normally be. The paladin gains the following performances at the indicated levels: inspire courage (1st), fascinate (4th), inspire competence (5th), suggestion (7th), dirge of dread (10th), inspire greatness (13th), frightening tune (16th), and mass suggestion (19th).

This ability replaces smite evil.

Aura of Truth (Su): At 11th level, the paladin automatically succeeds at saving throws to disbelieve illusions of the phantasm subschool and automatically gains a saving throw to disbelieve figment illusions when she observes them. Allies within 30 feet gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to disbelieve illusions of the phantasm subschool.

This ability replaces aura of justice.

Champion of Andoran (Su): At 20th level, an oathbound paladin becomes a champion of the people of Andoran. Her DR increases to 10/evil. Whenever she uses her stirring monologue, up to four creatures (including the paladin herself ) affected by the monologue gain SR 30 against spells with the evil descriptor or spell-like abilities cast by evil outsiders or undead. Weapons wielded by those affected by her stirring monologue are treated as good, silver, and cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, whenever the oathbound paladin channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals it the maximum possible amount.

This ability alters holy champion.

Code of Conduct: Know the laws of Andoran and do not exempt authorities from the application of the law.

Oath Spells: 1st-comprehend languages; 2nd-locate object; 3rd-tongues; 4th-true seeing.
