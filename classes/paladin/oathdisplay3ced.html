Oath against the Whispering Way

The Whispering Way is an enemy to all life in the world, and as a result many paladins feel called to contain its evil. This oath is identical to the oath against undeath (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 61) except as noted here.

Deities: Angradd, Arqueros, Iomedae, Sarenrae, Torag, Vildeis.

Aura against Necromancy (Su): At 8th level, the paladin gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against necromancy spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +2 morale bonus on these saves. This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead.

This ability replaces aura of resolve instead of aura of life.

Code of Conduct: Destroy agents of the Whispering Way and stop the spread of their philosophy.
