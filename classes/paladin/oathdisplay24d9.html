The Worldwound threatens all of Golarion with the uttermost depths of depravity, and so paladins across the world stand firm against it. This oath is identical to the oath against fiends (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 61) except as noted here.

Deities: Angradd, Arqueros, Iomedae, Kols, Ragathiel, Sarenrae, Torag, Vildeis.

Divine Bond (Su):: At 5th level, the paladin adds evil outsider bane to the list of weapon special abilities that can be added to her weapon and removes flaming from the list.

This ability alters divine bond.

Mercy (Su): At 12th level, the paladin can choose the following mercy.

Possessed: If the subject is affected by dominate person, possessed, or otherwise magically controlled by an evil outsider, this mercy grants the victim a new saving throw against the effect to end the effect at once.

Code of Conduct: Oppose demonic influence in all its forms and seek a way to close the Worldwound.
