Oath of Vengeance

While all paladins uphold the principals of law and good, sometimes these ideas must have a ruthless and dangerous side. It often falls upon a paladin to bring justice in the form of vengeance upon heinous transgressors against law and good. These oathbound paladins are always on the hunt for those who have perpetrated evil, and are the instrument of Heaven's most definitive and implacable judgment.

Channel Wrath (Su):  When an oathbound paladin reach 4th level, she can spend two uses of her lay on hands ability to gain an extra use of smite evil that day. This ability has no effect for a paladin who does not have the smite evil ability. This ability replaces channel positive energy.

Powerful Justice (Su):  At 11th level, an oathbound paladin may spends one use of her smite evil ability to grant her allies within 10 feet the ability to smite evil, except they only gain the paladin's bonus to damage, not her smite's attack bonus or ability to bypass DR. This ability replaces aura of justice.

Code of Conduct:  Never let lesser eveils distract you from your pursuit of just vengeance.

Oath Spells:  1st-wrath; 2nd-confess; 3rd-blessing of fervor; 4th-order's wrath.
