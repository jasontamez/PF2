Barbarian (Unchained) Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained</a>
As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the barbarian gains a rage power. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging. Some of these powers are always active during a rage, and others require the barbarian to take an action to use them. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Totem Rage Powers

Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat</a>
Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power (see the Advanced Player's Guide) cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).
Note: The <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldw0?The-FAQ-That-Time-Forgot">FAQ</a> clarifies that the Totem Warrior line for this description was removed, the restriction on only taking totem rage powers from one group is still in place.
