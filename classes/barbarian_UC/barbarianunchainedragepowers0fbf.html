Rage Powers - Barbarian (Unchained)









Barbarian (Unchained) Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained</a>
As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the barbarian gains a rage power. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging. Some of these powers are always active during a rage, and others require the barbarian to take an action to use them. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Offensive Rage Powers


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Animal Fury (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 9</a>):  The barbarian gains a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (if the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 if the barbarian is Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier. If made as part of a fullattack action with manufactured weapons, the bite attack is made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus - 5, and she adds only 1/2 her Strength modifier to the damage roll. The barbarian can make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. If the bite attack hits, grapple checks attempted by the barbarian against the target until the end of the round gain a +2 bonus.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Auspicious Mark (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 9</a>):  The barbarian has been marked by the spirits, as indicated by an impressive tattoo, scar, or birthmark she possesses. As a swift action, she can call upon the spirits' favor to increase any d20 roll she just made by rolling 1d6 and adding it to the result. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels she has. She can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll. This ability can be used only once per day.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Autumn Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian becomes a servant of the harvest. While raging, she gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to reposition or trip. She also gains this bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits. A barbarian can have only one season-themed rage power, choosing between spring, summer, autumn, or winter rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Bleeding Blow (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 9</a>):  While in the powerful stance, the barbarian can make an attack that causes her enemies to bleed profusely. Once per round, she can have one of her attacks deal an amount of bleed damage equal to 1/2 her bonus damage from powerful stance. This bleed damage bypasses damage reduction. This bleed damage doesn't stack with itself. A barbarian must have the powerful stance rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Body Bludgeon (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 26</a>):  While raging, if the barbarian pins an opponent that is smaller than her, she can then use that opponent as a two-handed improvised weapon that deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage, assuming the opponent is sized Small. Larger or smaller creatures used as a bludgeon deal damage based on their size using this base damage. A size Tiny creature deals 1d6 points of damage, a size Medium creature deals 1d10 points of damage, and so on. The barbarian can make a single attack using the pinned opponent as part of the action she uses to maintain the grapple, using her highest attack bonus. Whenever the barbarian hits using the pinned opponent as a weapon, she deals damage to her target normally, and the grappled opponent used as a bludgeon also takes the same damage she dealt to the target. If the pinned opponent is unable to resist being pinned for any reason, the barbarian can use that opponent as an improvised weapon without grappling or pinning the opponent, until the creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, at which point the creature becomes useless as an improvised weapon. A barbarian must be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Brawler (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 74</a>):  While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>. If she already has the feat, her unarmed strikes deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if she is Small).</td>
</tr><tr></td>Brawler, Greater (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 74</a>):  While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> when making unarmed strike attacks. A barbarian must have the brawler rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Crippling Blow (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 10</a>):  Once per day when the barbarian hits with an attack, she can deal 1 point of ability damage to the target's Strength or Dexterity score. This damage increases by 1 point for every 4 levels the barbarian has. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Deadly Accuracy (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 10</a>):  If the barbarian scores a critical threat while in the accurate stance, she applies double the accurate stance's bonus when rolling to confirm the critical. A barbarian must have the accurate stance rage power and be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Erratic Charge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): As part of the full-round action to perform a charge attack against a creature at least 20 feet away, the barbarian can move 5 feet in any direction before making the charge. This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and using this option reduces the maximum distance of the charge by 10 feet.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Erratic Charge, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): The barbarian can move 10 feet when using erratic charge. If she does so, the creature she is charging must be at least 20 feet away and the movement reduces the maximum distance of her charge by 20 feet. A barbarian must be at least 8th level and must have the erratic charge rage power before selecting this power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Trample (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the trample special attack (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 305). This attack inflicts 1d8 points of damage for a Medium mount, 2d6 for a Large mount, or 2d8 for a Huge mount, plus 1-1/2 times the mount's Strength modifier. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the mount's Strength modifier) halves this damage. Creatures in the mount's path or that threaten squares it passes through may make attacks of opportunity against either the barbarian or the mount, but not both. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Trample, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  A barbarian's mount can affect creatures up to its own size with its ferocious trample. In addition, it can make an overrun combat maneuver check as a free action against a creature that fails its Reflex save (or chooses not to save in order to take an attack of opportunity) against its trample. A barbarian must have the ferocious trample rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Furious Barrage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): The barbarian is treated as having the <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot</a> feat, but only for the purpose of attacking with thrown weapons. She need not meet the feat's prerequisites. A barbarian must be at least 4th level and must have the furious draw rage power before selecting this power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ground Breaker (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  The barbarian can attack the floor around her as a full-round action. This attack automatically hits and deals damage normally. If the barbarian deals more damage than the floor's hardness, the space she occupies and all of the squares adjacent to her become difficult terrain. Creatures in those squares, except the barbarian, must succeed at DC 15 Reflex saves or be knocked prone. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ground Breaker, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  When using the ground breaker rage power, the barbarian can extend the radius of the effect by 5 feet. This rage power can be selected up to three times, and its effects stack. A barbarian must be at least 8th level and have the ground breaker rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hissing Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  Once per hour, the barbarian can spit venom at an adjacent enemy as a standard action. She must make a touch attack to successfully spit on a foe in this way, but she can also apply this poison as a swift action when she hits with a bite attack. The DC of the save against this poison is equal to 10 + half the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier.

Hissing Rage Poison (Su) Bite-contact or injury; save Fort; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Hurling (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  As lesser hurling, but the barbarian can increase the range increment to 20 feet or increase the size of a hurled object by one size category. A barbarian must have the lesser hurling rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Hurling Charge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging and making a charge attack, the barbarian may draw and throw a hurled weapon during her charge, gaining the normal +2 attack roll bonus on the thrown weapon attack as well as on the melee attack at the end of the charge. The barbarian must move at least 10 feet before using a thrown weapon and at least 10 additional feet before making a melee attack at the end of her charge. The barbarian must have a thrown weapon in hand or have one hand free at the beginning of her charge. A barbarian must have the lesser hurling rage power to select this rage power.

This inflicts damage as a <a href="rules57a7.html?Name=Falling%20Objects&amp;Category=Environmental%20Rules">falling object</a> plus the barbarian's Strength bonus. This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. This is a ranged touch attack, and the target may attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) for half damage. The barbarian may apply <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a> to this attack as a one- or two-handed weapon, as appropriate.</td>

She can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an adjacent foe as a move action instead of a standard action. If the barbarian successfully demoralizes an adjacent foe, that foe is shaken for the remainder of the barbarian's current rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Knockback (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 11</a>):  Once per round, the barbarian can attempt a bull rush against one target in place of a melee attack, using her full CMB regardless of the attack it replaces. If the bull rush is successful, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier and is knocked back as normal. The barbarian doesn't move with the target. This bull rush doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.</td>

She also ignores cover penalties except those from total cover. A barbarian must have the accurate stance rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Shove Aside (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  Whenever the barbarian charges, she may push past one of her allies. That ally does not block the path of the charge as long as the ally is not adjacent to the target of the charge. This does not move the ally's position; it simply allows the barbarian to move past.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Shove Aside, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 12</a>):  This functions as shove aside, but it applies to any number of allies, so long as they are not adjacent to the target of the charge.

</tr><tr></td>Summer Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian channels the heat of late summer, making the air around her hot and oppressive. A creature within the barbarian's reach becomes fatigued as long as it remains within the barbarian's reach unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the barbarian's level + her Constitution modifier) to become immune for 24 hours. A barbarian can have only one season-themed rage power, choosing between spring, summer, autumn, or winter rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Sunder Enchantment (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  While raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver on a magical item, that item's magical abilities are suppressed for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 points by which her combat maneuver check exceeded the target's CMD. A barbarian must have the spell sunder rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</td>

All enemies that have been shaken by the barbarian (usually through the Intimidate skill) within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + her Strength modifier) or be panicked for 1d4+1 rounds. Once an enemy has attempted a save versus this ability (whether successful or not), it's immune to this power for 24 hours. A barbarian must be at least 8th level and have the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Two-Fanged Pounce (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): If the barbarian is wielding a pair of daggers, kukris, or punching daggers, she can attack once with each of the two weapons when she charges.

</tr><tr></td>Unexpected Strike (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 13</a>):  The barbarian can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the barbarian, regardless of whether that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. The barbarian can use this ability only when there are no other foes in a square threatened by the barbarian. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Winter Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 37</a>):  As a standard action, the barbarian can bellow a 20-foot cone of frigid, snowy air. Until the beginning of the barbarian's next turn, creatures moving through the cone move at half speed.

This damage bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has. In addition, if she confirms a critical hit against a creature affected by an ongoing beneficial spell effect, that effect is suppressed for 1 round (determined randomly if the creature is currently affected by more than one effect). A barbarian must have the superstition rage power to select this rage power.</td>
