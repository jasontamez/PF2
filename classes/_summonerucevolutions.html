Evolutions - Eidolon (Unchained)









Evolutions


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained</a>
Each eidolon gains a number of evolution points that can be spent to give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the eidolon additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus and add the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as secondary are made using the eidolon's base attack bonus - 5 and add 1/2 the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the eidolon has only a single natural attack, the attack is made using its full base attack bonus, and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack's type.

Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the points must be spent whenever the summoner gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can be selected only once.



1-Point Evolutions


The following evolutions cost 1 point from the eidolon's evolution pool.

The eidolon can cast that spell as a psychic spell at will. The spell requires thought and emotion components as normal for psychic magic (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144). The eidolon's caster level is equal to the eidolon's Hit Dice - 2 (minimum CL 1st). The save DC equals 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Charisma modifier.

This attack is a primary attack. The bite deals 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge).

</tr><tr>
<td>Magic Attacks (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 35</a>): The eidolon is infused with magic, allowing it to treat all of its natural attacks as if they were magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Eidolons with the grab evolution linked to their pincers gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. The eidolon must have the limbs (arms) evolution to take this evolution. Alternatively, the eidolon can replace the claws from its base form with pincers (this still costs 1 evolution point). This evolution can be selected more than once, up to the number of limbs (arms) evolutions the eidolon possesses.

Select one type of natural attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful attack of the selected type, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, it pulls the target of the attack 5 feet closer to it. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Creatures pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different natural attack. Requirements: Reach of 10 feet or more.</td>

Select one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The eidolon gains resistance 5 against that energy type. This resistance increases by 5 for every 5 levels the summoner possesses, to a maximum of 15 at 10th level. This evolution can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time the eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a different energy type.</td>

The eidolon gains the scent special quality, allowing it to detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if the opponent is downwind, the range drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can be detected at twice the normal range. Scent does not allow the eidolon to precisely locate the creature, only to detect its presence. It can detect the direction as a move action. The eidolon can pinpoint the creature's location if it is within 5 feet. The eidolon can use scent to track creatures.</td>

This attack is a primary attack. The slam deals 1d8 points of damage (2d6 if Large, 2d8 if Huge). The eidolon must have the limbs (arms) evolution to take this evolution.

This evolution can be selected more than once, up to the number of the eidolon's limbs (arms) evolutions.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sting (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 36</a>): The eidolon possesses a long, barbed stinger at the end of its tail, granting it a sting attack.

Requirements: Aberrant subtype.</td>

Whenever the eidolon successfully grapples a foe using the grab evolution, it deals additional damage equal to the amount of damage dealt by the attack the grab evolution is tied to. Requirements: Serpentine base form, grab evolution.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Energy Attacks (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 36</a>): The eidolon's attacks become charged with energy.

The eidolon gains a fly speed equal to its base speed. The eidolon's maneuverability depends on its size. Medium or smaller eidolons have good maneuverability. Large eidolons have average maneuverability, while Huge eidolons have poor maneuverability. For 2 additional evolution points, the eidolon flies by means of magic. It loses its wings, but its maneuverability increases to perfect. If the eidolon flies by magic, this is a supernatural ability.

Select one spell from the following list: compel hostility, lesser confusion, hypnotism, mind thrust I, or vanish. The eidolon can use that spell thereafter as a psychic spell by spending 1 point of psychic energy. The caster level and save DC are the same as for basic psychic magic. This evolution can be selected more than once, selecting a different spell each time. The eidolon's amount of psychic energy available to spend each day does not stack-it uses only the highest number of points granted by its most powerful psychic magic evolution. Requirements: Aberrant subtype; basic psychic magic evolution; Charisma 11; summoner level 5th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Limbs (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 37</a>): The eidolon grows an additional pair of limbs. These limbs can take one of two forms. They can be made into legs, complete with feet. Each pair of legs increases the eidolon's base speed by 10 feet. Alternatively, they can be made into arms, complete with hands. The eidolon does not gain any additional natural attacks for an additional pair of arms, but it can take other evolutions that add additional attacks (such as claws or slam). Arms that have hands can be used to wield weapons, if the eidolon is proficient. This evolution can be selected more than once.</td>
</tr><tr>

These attacks are primary attacks. The eidolon can make these additional attacks each time it succeeds at a grapple check against the target. These rake attacks deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). This evolution counts as one natural attack toward the eidolon's maximum. Requirements: Summoner level 4th, quadruped base form.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Trample (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 37</a>): The eidolon gains the ability to crush its foes underfoot, gaining the trample ability. As a full-round action, the eidolon can overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself. This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the eidolon does not need to attempt a check; it merely has to move over opponents in its path. The creatures take 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon's Strength modif ier. Targets of the trample can make attacks of opportunity at a -4 penalty. If a target forgoes this attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Strength modifier. A trampling eidolon can deal trampling damage to a specific creature only once per round. Requirements: Biped or quadruped base form.</td>

This works like the blindsense evolution, but only if both the eidolon and the creature to be pinpointed are in contact with the ground. Requirements: Summoner level 7th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Trip (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 37</a>): The eidolon becomes adept at knocking foes to the ground with its bite, granting it a trip attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful bite attack, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, the target is knocked prone. If the eidolon fails, it is not tripped in return. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. Requirements: Daemon, demon, devil, elemental, or protean subtype; bite evolution.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Weapon Training (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 37</a>): The eidolon learns to use a weapon, gaining Simple Weapon Proficiency as a bonus feat.

3-Point Evolutions


The following evolutions cost 3 points from the eidolon's evolution pool.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Advanced Psychic Magic (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 19</a>): The eidolon gains 5 points of psychic energy that it can spend each day. Select one spell from the following list: darkness, detect thoughts, disfiguring touch, id insinuation I, mind thrust II, or touch of idiocy. The eidolon can cast that spell as a psychic spell by spending 2 points of psychic energy. The caster level and save DC are the same as for basic psychic magic. This evolution can be selected more than once, selecting a different spell each time. The eidolon's amount of psychic energy available to spend each day does not stack-it uses only the highest number of points granted by its most powerful psychic magic evolution. Requirements: Aberrant subtype; intermediate psychic magic evolution; Charisma 12; summoner level 7th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Alien Consciousness (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 19</a>): The eidolon's mind is dangerously incomprehensible to mortals who contact it. Nonaberrations that read the eidolon's mind or make mental contact with it take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if you use the sanity rules from Horror Adventures). This contact also includes communication via telepathy-an eidolon that has telepathic capability must initiate this particular contact as a swift action against a single target in order to force its alien consciousness on another creature. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Charisma modifier) halves the damage. Once a creature has been subjected to the eidolon's alien consciousness, it is immune to further damage from that eidolon's alien consciousness for 24 hours. The eidolon's summoner is immune to his own eidolon's alien consciousness, but he can still be affected by other eidolons' alien consciousnesses. This is a mind-affecting effect. Requirements: Aberrant or protean subtype; summoner level 9th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blindsense (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon's senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense with a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it can't see without having to attempt a Perception check, but such creatures still have total concealment from the eidolon. Visibility still affects the eidolon's movement, and it is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. Requirements: Summoner level 9th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Burrow (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through the earth. The eidolon gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed. It can use this speed to move through clay, dirt, earth, and sand. It does not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface. Requirements: Summoner level 9th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Damage Reduction (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon's body becomes more resistant to harm. Increase the damage reduction granted by the eidolon's subtype by 5. Requirements: Summoner level 15th, damage reduction granted by the eidolon's subtype.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frightful Presence (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent that fails this save, that opponent becomes frightened instead. Foes with more Hit Dice than the eidolon are immune to this effect. Requirements: Summoner level 11th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pounce (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon gains quick reflexes, allowing it to make a full attack after a charge. Requirements: Summoner level 7th, quadruped base form.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Swallow Whole (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon gains the swallow whole ability, giving it the ability to consume its foes. If the eidolon begins its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab evolution), it can attempt a combat maneuver check to swallow the creature. The creature must be at least one size category smaller than the eidolon. Swallowed creatures take an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the eidolon's bite damage each round + 1d6 points of damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light piercing or slashing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The eidolon's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has returned to the eidolon's mouth, where it can attempt to escape or can be swallowed again. Requirements: Summoner level 9th; agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype; grab (bite) evolution.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Web (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon gains a pair of spinnerets, giving it the ability to spin webs. The eidolon can use these webs to support itself plus one creature of up to the same size. It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to eight times per day, entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with a successful Escape Artist check, or with a Strength check at a -4 penalty. The DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The webs have a hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the eidolon's total Hit Dice. The eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its webs. Requirements: Summoner level 7th; daemon, demon, or protean subtype; climb evolution.</td>

4-Point Evolutions


The following evolutions cost 4 points from the eidolon's evolution pool.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Amorphous (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 19</a>): The eidolon's biology lacks discernible weak points. It is not subject to critical hits and sneak attacks. Requirements: Aberrant or elemental subtype; summoner level 9th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blindsight (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon's senses sharpen even further, granting it blindsight with a range of 30 feet. The eidolon can maneuver and attack as normal, ignoring darkness, invisibility, and most forms of concealment as long as it has line of effect to the target. Requirements: Summoner level 11th, blindsense evolution.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Breath Weapon (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the selected type per Hit Dice it possesses. Those caught in the breath weapon can attempt a Ref lex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The eidolon can use this ability once per day. The eidolon can gain additional uses of this ability per day by spending 1 evolution point per additional use (to a maximum of three total uses per day). Requirements: Summoner level 9th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Disease (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 19</a>): One of the eidolon's natural weapons carries a disease chosen from the following list: bubonic plague, filth fever, leprosy, red ache, or shakes. Each hit forces a saving throw against the disease's normal effects. The disease has no onset, however. The save DC equals 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The eidolon can expose a creature to its disease no more than once per round. By spending 2 additional evolution points, you can instead choose the following additional diseases: demon fever (only if the eidolon has the demon subtype), devil chills (only if the eidolon has the devil subtype), or slimy doom. Requirements: Aberrant, daemon, demon, or devil subtype or the undead appearance evolution; summoner level 7th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fast Healing (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 38</a>): The eidolon's body gains the ability to heal wounds very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The eidolon heals 1 point of damage per round, just like via natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive. This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner. This healing can be increased by 1 point per round for every 2 additional evolution points spent (to a maximum of 5 points per round). Requirements: Summoner level 11th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Large (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 39</a>): The eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The eidolon gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a -1 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a -2 penalty on Fly checks, and a -4 penalty on Stealth checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains a reach of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total.

If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the eidolon instead becomes Huge. The eidolon gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a -2 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a 10-foot reach, a -4 penalty on Fly checks, and a -8 penalty on Stealth checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet instead of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total. These bonuses and penalties replace, and do not stack with, those gained from becoming Large.

The ability increase evolution costs twice as much (4 evolution points) when adding to the Strength or Constitution scores of a Large or Huge eidolon. Requirements: Summoner level 8th (13th for Huge), Medium size.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spell Resistance (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 39</a>): The eidolon is protected against magic, gaining spell resistance. The eidolon's spell resistance is equal to 11 + the summoner's level. This spell resistance does not apply to spells cast by the summoner. Requirements: Summoner level 9th.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Superior Psychic Magic (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9op8?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Horror-Realms">Horror Realms pg. 19</a>): The eidolon has 7 points of psychic magic to spend each day. Select one spell from the following list: confusion, deeper darkness, displacement, jester's jaunt, id insinuation II, or mind thrust III. The eidolon can cast that spell as a psychic spell by spending 3 points of psychic energy. The caster level and save DC are the same as for basic psychic magic. This evolution can be selected more than once, selecting a different spell each time. The eidolon's amount of psychic energy available to spend each day does not stack; it uses only the highest number of points granted by its most powerful psychic magic evolution. Requirements: Aberrant subtype; advanced psychic magic evolution; summoner level 11th; Charisma 13.</td>
