**Phantom**

**Description Source**: [Occult Adventures](source:Occult Adventures)
A phantom's abilities are determined by the spiritualist's level and the choice of manifestations the spiritualist makes when she performs the manifestation ritual. Table 1-11: Manifested Phantom's Base Statistics on page 77 determines many of the base statistics of the phantom. Each phantom possesses an emotional focus that modifies these base statistics and abilities. Phantoms are considered outsiders for the purpose of determining which spells affect them.

[^D]: The value shown is for Medium phantoms. See Table 1-12 for Small or Large phantoms.

**Class Level**: This is the spiritualist's class level.

**HD**: This is the total number of 10-sided (d10) Hit Dice the phantom possesses, each of which is modified by the phantom's Constitution, as normal.

**BAB**: This is the phantom's base attack bonus. A phantom's base attack bonus is equal to its Hit Dice. Phantoms do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons at higher base attack bonuses.

**Good/Bad Saves**: These are the phantom's base saving throw bonuses. A phantom possesses two good saving throws and one bad saving throw, determined by the phantom's emotional focus (see page 80).

**Skills**: This lists the phantom's total skill ranks. A phantom can assign skill ranks to any skills, but it must possess the appropriate appendage to use some skills. Phantoms with Intelligence scores above the base value modify these totals as normal (a phantom gains a number of skill ranks equal to 2 + its Intelligence modifier per Hit Die). A phantom can't have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice. Phantom skill ranks are set once chosen.

**Feats**: This is the total number of feats possessed by a phantom. A phantom can select any feat it qualifies for, but it must possess the appropriate appendage in order to use some feats. Phantom feats are set once chosen.

**Armor Bonus**: The number noted here is the increase to the phantom's natural armor bonus when it manifests as an ectoplasmic creature, and its deflection bonus when it manifests as an incorporeal creature. An ectoplasmic or incorporeal manifested phantom can't wear armor of any kind, as the armor interferes with the spiritualist's connection with the phantom; a phantom may seem to be wearing armor, but this appearance is just an illusory part of its appearance.

**Dex/Cha Bonus**: Add this bonus to the phantom's Dexterity and Charisma scores.

**Slam Damage**: Phantoms have two slam natural weapon attacks. Those attacks' damage is based on the size of the phantom and is sometimes modified by the abilities of the phantom's emotional focus. Table 1-11 gives the damage by spiritualist level of the slam attacks made by a Medium phantom. See Table 1-12 for the damage of such attacks for Small and Large phantoms. Often, an individual phantom manifests in a form that makes it appear as if it had weapons or other natural attacks. Regardless of their apparent forms, the phantom's attacks still deal the slam attack damage listed on Table 1-11 or Table 1-12.

**Special**: This column includes a number of abilities gained by all phantoms as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.

*Darkvision (Ex)*: The phantom has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

*Link (Su)*: A spiritualist and her phantom share a mental link that allows for communication across distances (as long as they are on the same plane). This communication is a free action that can be performed even when it isn't the spiritualist's turn, but the spiritualist and the phantom must both be conscious to communicate in this way. This allows the spiritualist to give orders to her phantom at any time. Magic items interfere with a spiritualist's connection to her phantom; as a result, the spiritualist and her phantom share magic item slots. For example, if the spiritualist is wearing a magic ring, her phantom can wear only one magic ring. In the case of a conf lict, the items worn by the spiritualist remain active, and those worn by the phantom become dormant. The phantom must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.

*Share Spells (Su)*: The spiritualist can cast a spell with a target of “you” on her phantom (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A spiritualist can cast spells from the spiritualist spell list on her phantom even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the phantom's type (outsider). This ability does not allow the phantom to share abilities that aren't spells, even if they function like spells.

*Deliver Touch Spells (Su)*: The phantom can deliver touch spells for the spiritualist when fully manifested in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. The spiritualist and the phantom need not be in contact to accomplish this, but the phantom must be within 30 feet and the spiritualist must be able to see the phantom. If the spiritualist is 12th level or higher, the phantom can deliver touch spells within 50 feet of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can cast the spell, and then the phantom can deliver the touch as an immediate action. If the touch spell deals damage, the phantom must make the attack roll. The phantom can't hold the charge of a touch spell cast by the spiritualist using this ability. If the spell is delivered to the phantom, it must touch a target or the spell is lost. If the spell allows you to touch up to six willing targets, the phantom can accomplish this with an immediate action, but all of the willing targets must be within the phantom's melee reach at the time.

*Magic Attacks (Su)*: When the phantom manifests in ectoplasmic form, it treats its slam attacks as if they were magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If the spiritualist is 10th level or higher, all of the phantom's weapons are treated as the alignment of the phantom for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

*Ability Score Increase (Ex)*: The phantom adds 1 to one of its ability scores.

*Devotion (Ex)*: The phantom gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.

*Incorporeal Flight (Su)*: When the phantom manifests in incorporeal form, it has a fly speed of 40 feet (good).

**Phantom Statistics**

A spiritualist's phantom is typically the same size as the spiritualist. A spiritualist can have a phantom that is one size category smaller than her, and if she is Small or smaller, she can have a phantom one size category larger than her. A phantom is always a humanoid-shaped creature, and looks somewhat like it did in its past life while manifested, though the emotional turmoil of its existence usually warps its appearance in some way.

Every phantom has the following base statistics, which are then modified by its size and emotional focus.


**Phantom**

**Starting Statistics**: **Type** Outsider (phantom); **Size** As spiritualist or one size category smaller (or one size category larger, if the spiritualist is Small or smaller); **Speed** 30 ft.; **AC** +2 dodge (in incorporeal form) or +2 natural armor (in ectoplasmic form); **Attack** 2 slams (1d6 or 1d4 if size Small); **Ability Scores** Str 12, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 13.

**Phantom Skills**

The following skills are class skills for the phantom: Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Stealth (Dex). In addition, at 1st level, the spiritualist can choose one additional skill as a class skill for her phantom. The phantom also gains two class skills based on its emotional focus. The phantom automatically gains bonus ranks in these two skills as the spiritualist increases in level-its number of ranks in these skills is always equal to its number of Hit Dice.

**Full Manifestation Forms**

Each time she fully manifests her phantom, the spiritualist must choose whether to manifest the phantom in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. The phantom gains the statistics presented on Table 1-11: Manifested Phantom's Base Statistics, modified by the phantom's emotional focus and by the type of manifestation the spiritualist chooses.

**Ectoplasmic**: When the spiritualist manifests her phantom in ectoplasmic form, the phantom gains the following abilities.

*Damage Reduction*: A phantom manifested in ectoplasmic form has DR 5/slashing. When the spiritualist reaches 5th level, the phantom gains DR 5/magic. At 10th level, the damage resistance increases to 10/magic. At 15th level, it increases to 15/magic, and at 20th level, the damage reduction becomes DR 15/-.

*Phase Lurch (Su)*: A phantom in ectoplasmic form has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles. In order to use this ability, it must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. An ectoplasmic phantom can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.

**Incorporeal**: When the spiritualist chooses to manifest the phantom in incorporeal form, the phantom appears within 30 feet of the spiritualist as a ghostly apparition. It gains the incorporeal subtype (*Pathfinder RPG Bestiary* 301), including a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modif ier. Since it isn't an undead creature, it takes no damage from holy water or positive energy. Unlike other incorporeal creatures, an incorporeal phantom can't attack corporeal creatures, except to deliver touch-attack spells using the deliver touch spell ability. An incorporeal manifested phantom can make slam attacks against other incorporeal creatures as if it were in ectoplasmic form.
