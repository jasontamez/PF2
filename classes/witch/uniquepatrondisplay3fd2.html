Your powers hail from an incomprehensible being from beyond the stars, whose motivations and needs erode your psyche. You gain the unnerve beasts hex at 1st level, but you take a -2 penalty on saving throws against confusion and emotion effects and are affected by such effects for at least 1 round even on a successful saving throw.

Available Patron Themes: Insanity, Occult, Stars, Transformation

Spell Changes: 2nd-lesser confusion, 8th-dreadscape, 10th-compelling rant.
