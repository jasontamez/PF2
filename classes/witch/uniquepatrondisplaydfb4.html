While good deities and empyreal lords have organized faiths to carry out their wills, powerfully ranked agathions, angels, and archons-and occasional intersectional councils of good outsiders'sometimes invest white witches with celestial might to defend the weak and heal the sick. You gain the ward hex at 1st level, but your patron holds you to a higher standard: you must be of good alignment, and you take a -2 penalty on Bluff, Intimidate, Sleight of Hand, and other skill checks to deceive or threaten others.

Available Patron Themes: Endurance, Healing, Light, Portents

Spell Changes: 4th-castigate, 10th-rebuke, 16th- greater planar ally (good outsiders only).
