Your witch powers are a manifestation of the Green Faith or bestowed by a representative of natural forces, such as an ancient treant or nature spirit, who expects you to wield such gifts on its behalf. You gain the feral speech hex at 1st level, but you cannot abide the touch of iron or steel; contact with either metal deals 1d3 points of damage each round, and wearing metal armor prevents you from casting spells until it is removed.

Available Patron Themes: Animals, Endurance, Moon, Transformation

Spell Changes: 2nd-entangle, 6th-plant growth, 10th-tree stride.
