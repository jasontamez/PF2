Aeons are often patrons to witches, seeking out mortals who share their vested interest in some agenda that helps them promote the cosmic balance. You gain the scar hex at 1st level, but such service requires unwavering commitment to their cause, and you lose your spellcasting and hexes (but not your familiar) if your alignment changes after taking your first witch level; you regain your spellcasting and hexes once you revert to your original alignment.

Available Patron Themes: Elements, Time, Transformation, Wisdom

Spell Changes: 2nd-forbid action, 8th-dismissal, 12th-geas/quest.
