Infernal Contract

Your power was brokered from a powerful daemon, demon, or devil to speed the corruption and moral decay of mortals. When you die, your soul goes to Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell, and you can't be raised or resurrected except by extraordinary means-though bold service may earn you a favored position in damnation. You gain the misfortune hex at 1st level, but your magic requires sacrifice; each day when you prepare spells, you must deal 1d6 points of damage to yourself as part of your infernal ritual, feeding the lost blood to your familiar. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this damage increases by 1d6.

Available Patron Themes: Enchantment, Strength, Trickery, Vengeance

Spell Changes: 8th-lesser planar ally, 12th-planar ally, 16th- greater planar ally (your bonus spells can be used to summon only the type of outsider your patron represents).
