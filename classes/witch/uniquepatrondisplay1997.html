A powerful fey or other entity from the First World has offered you magic. You serve as an anchor and scrying focus in the Material Plane for your patron, but you also provide frequent amusement. You gain the charm hex at 1st level, but your fey patron delights in your failure and injury and frequently jinxes you; once each day, the Game Master can demand you reroll a single ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check and use the worse result.

Available Patron Themes: Agility, Enchantment, Trickery, Winter

Spell Changes: 2nd-disguise self, 4th-hideous laughter, 16th- irresistible dance.
