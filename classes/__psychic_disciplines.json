				"Your mind is impure, tainted by outside forces. These might be monstrous ancestors whose blood still flows within you, or powerful and unknowable psychic forces that intrude upon your mind. Like a psychic disease, this influence consumes part of your brain, creating a dark counterpart to your normal self. Every time you call forth a psychic spell, you're drawing on this dangerous force-and potentially giving it a greater hold on you. This malign influence might stem from creatures like rakshasas and aboleths, or perhaps malign entities that dwell in the voids between the stars.",

You can attempt to return to your normal self as a free action, but must succeed at a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level. If you fail, you continue to manifest your dark half and can't attempt to change back for 1 round.

If a creature is affected, the colors of its skin, hair, and eyes dull and become less vibrant.

				"Drain Vibrancy: At 13th level, you can drain the color and vitality from the world around you. Three times per day, as a standard action you can drain vibrancy within a 30-foot radius, causing the area and all creatures within it to become pale and sallow. Each living creature in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier) or take 1 temporary negative level as their life force drains away. If you're at least 17th level, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 2 temporary negative levels instead."

				"Dream Leech (Su): While adjacent to a sleeping or unconscious creature, you can take a swift action to siphon that creature's dreams, thereby learning new things about your own mind. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect; such creatures are never considered willing. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect. If the subject fails the save, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the subject within the next 24 hours, and you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but no more than once per hour and no more than once per creature per day.",
				"Oneiromancy (Su): As a standard action, you can tamper with the minds of sleeping creatures. You plant a subconscious thought in a sleeping creature's mind by attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the sleeping creature's attitude or request a service from it. If you succeed, when the creature wakes it behaves in the way you dictated with the normal restrictions for the Diplomacy or Intimidate skill. The target of oneiromancy remains unaware of this manipulation, though if you fail your Diplomacy check the subject might have its starting attitude toward you negatively impacted, as normal. You must be adjacent to the sleeping creature to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this ability as part of the casting of dream, minor dream, or nightmare. In this case, the oneiromancy effect takes place when the spell is cast. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect.",
				"Mind Heist (Sp): At 5th level, you can delve into the subconscious mind of a sleeping target. You can cast detect thoughts as a spell-like ability on any adjacent sleeping creature. Additionally, you can gain the benefit of detect thoughts on a target of your dream, minor dream, or nightmare spells as if you had studied the target for 3 rounds. If you cast dream scan (see page 166), you know whether you received false information from the dream. A successful Will save negates mind heist. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.",
				"Waking Dream (Sp): At 13th level, as a standard action, you can take control of the body of a sleeping creature within 30 feet for 1 hour per level. This ability functions like magic jar, except that your soul travels directly into the sleeping target with no receptacle necessary and the target creature's consciousness remains dreaming and unaware of its body's actions. When waking dream ends or the host body is destroyed, you immediately wake up in your body regardless of the distance from the host body, provided your body hasn't been destroyed. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect."

				"Discipline Powers: Your powers relate to your extensive knowledge and your ability to alter and adapt your memory.",
				"Illuminating Answers (Su): You can glean deeper truths from advice you magically obtain, even if the information itself is specious. When you use a spell or spell-like ability that allows you to get answers to questions (such as augury, blood biography, or contact other plane) and get at least one answer, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You regain this point even if the answer is false or vague. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.",
				"Mnemonic Cache (Su): You can memorize a piece of information and later recall it perfectly. Your mnemonic cache can hold roughly 10 pages of written information, including images and maps, or 30 minutes' worth of speech or music. (Memorizing music doesn't confer the ability to perform it properly.) The amount you can store increases by 5 pages and 5 minutes at 2nd level, and at every psychic level thereafter. You can hold only one piece of information in your mnemonic cache at a time. The information doesn't go away when you recall it, but when you put a new piece of information in the cache, the old piece becomes as imperfect any other memory. Memorizing magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) doesn't confer the ability to borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. You could reproduce the spell in writing to allow someone who prepares spells from a spellbook to prepare it, though this functions as using a borrowed spellbook for anyone other than you. If you're in telepathic contact with another creature (through telepathic bond, for example), you can transfer the information directly into its mind as a free action. For this creature, the information functions like a normal memory, not one with perfect clarity.",
				"You can attempt to sequester a written magical trap (such as explosive runes or sepia snake sigil) in your mnemonic cache and destroy it. Treat this as a Disable Device check to disarm a magical trap (as though you had the trapfinding class feature). Your bonus on this roll is equal to either your Disable Device modifier or the sum of 5 + your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, instead of being disabled, the trap is erased and destroyed. This ability can't destroy symbol traps; it functions only if written text is involved.",
				"Superior Automatic Writing (Ex): At 5th level, when attempting checks for the automatic writing occult skill unlock (see page 194), you can treat your psychic level + your Wisdom bonus as your number of Linguistics skill ranks. At 8th level, you gain an additional option when using automatic writing, and can attempt a DC 35 check to gain information as though you-d used commune instead of augury or divination. This type of commune requires no material component, and the duration equals 1 round per psychic class level you possess. You connect to a distant being of great intellect, a fragment of the Akashic Record (see page 244), or a similar bastion of knowledge instead of to a deity.",
				"Memory Palace (Su): At 13th level, you mentally construct an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing the volumes of lore you've studied. This ability functions as mage's magnificent mansion, with the following adjustments: the memory palace is limited in size to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your psychic level; your memory palace doesn't contain any furniture other than bookcases and a few desks and sofas where you and your visitors can study; and there is no food within, though the memory palace does contain a number of unseen servants equal to 1/2 your psychic level, which function solely as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you summon it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating. You can reshape the memory palace in your mind, so it doesn't need to currently be in effect for you to alter it. You can create your memory palace once per day.",
				"Choose one type of Knowledge skill when you gain this ability. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within-including you-a +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks of that type, and the memory palace counts as an extensive library for people attempting Knowledge checks of that type untrained. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks with the chosen skill when you're not consulting the palace (including when the palace isn't in effect). At 14th level and at each additional level thereafter, choose another Knowledge skill to which your memory palace's library bonuses apply."

In addition, you can cast other psychic spells while concentrating on that spell.",

If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the alchemist's mutagen ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 28).

A creature that fails its save doesn't need to continue making saves while it's confused by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends. This is a mind-affecting effect. You're immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from your aura.
