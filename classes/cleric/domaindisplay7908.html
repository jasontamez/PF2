Granted Powers: You are infused with the glory of the divine, and are a true foe of the undead. In addition, when you channel positive energy to harm undead creatures, the save DC to halve the damage is increased by 2.

Touch of Glory (Sp): You can cause your hand to shimmer with divine radiance, allowing you to touch a creature as a standard action and give it a bonus equal to your cleric level on a single Charisma-based skill check or Charisma ability check. This ability lasts for 1 hour or until the creature touched elects to apply the bonus to a roll. You can use this ability to grant the bonus a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.

Divine Presence (Su): At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of divine presence for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level. All allies within this aura are treated as if under the effects of a sanctuary spell with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Wisdom modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is a standard action. If an ally leaves the area or makes an attack, the effect ends for that ally. If you make an attack, the effect ends for you and your allies.

Domain Spells: 1st-shield of faith, 2nd-[bless weapon](spell:bless weapon), 3rd-[searing light](spell:searing light), 4th-[holy smite](spell:holy smite), 5th-[righteous might](spell:righteous might), 6th-[undeath to death](spell:undeath to death), 7th-[holy sword](spell:holy sword), 8th-[holy aura](spell:holy aura), 9th-[gate](spell:gate).

Replacement Power: The following granted power replaces the touch of glory power of the Glory domain.

Bolstering Touch (Sp): You can touch a willing creature as a standard action, bracing it against frightening situations and allowing it to remain calm. The first fear effect that would affect the subject within the next hour is suppressed for the first 1d4 rounds of its effect. If you touch a creature currently suffering from an ongoing fear effect, this ability instead suppresses the ongoing fear effect for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the effect's duration. If the fear effect is suppressed for longer than it lasts, the subject isn't affected by the fear effect at all. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.

Replacement Domain Spells: 1st-remove fear, 3rd-[heroism](spell:heroism), 6th-[greater heroism](spell:greater heroism).

Replacement Power: The following granted power replaces the touch of glory power of the Glory domain.

Honor Bound (Su): With a touch, you can remind a creature of its duties and responsibilities, granting it a new saving throw against each enchantment (charm) or enchantment (compulsion) effect that currently affects it. If the saving throw is successful, the enchantment effect is ended. This power only affects effects that allow a save. If you fail a save against such an effect, you can use this ability as an immediate action to grant yourself an additional save. Once the target (either you or a touched creature) has made one additional save per effect, this ability has no further effect on that particular enchantment effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.

Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd-[zone of truth](spell:zone of truth), 6th-[geas/quest](spell:geas/quest).


Hubris Subdomain

This subdomain requires the <a href="traitdisplay8328.html?ItemName=Acolyte%20of%20Apocrypha">Acolyte of Apocrypha</a> trait to access.
Associated Domain(s): Glory, Nobility

Replacement Power: You gain Intimidate as a class skill; this replaces the Glory domain's increased save DC to resist channel positive energy. The following granted power replaces the divine presence power of the Glory domain or the leadership power of the Nobility domain.

:Divine Demand (Su): At 6th level, you can petition your divine patron for far greater power than you deserve. Activating this ability is a swift action that you must use as you cast a spell that has a reduced (but not negated) effect on a successful save. The saving throw DC of the spell increases by 2, and you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with the spell. Any creature that succeeds at the saving throw instead avoids the effect entirely. If half or more of the targets are unaffected, you become shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. If all of the targets are unaffected, you instead lose the ability to cast divine spells, channel energy, and use domain powers for 1d4+1 rounds; you can end this loss as a full-round action by loudly apologizing to your patron deity as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability once per day at 6th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 6th.

Replacement Domain Spells: 4th-[hollow heroism](spell:hollow heroism), 7th-[greater hollow heroism](spell:greater hollow heroism), 9th-[overwhelming presence](spell:overwhelming presence). If you are evil, replace the domain spells bless weapon and holy aura with aid and unholy aura respectively.


Legend Subdomain

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 23</a>
This subdomain requires the <a href="traitdisplay8328.html?ItemName=Acolyte%20of%20Apocrypha">Acolyte of Apocrypha</a> trait to access.
Associated Domain(s): Glory
Associated Deities: <a href="deitydisplay593d.html?ItemName=General%20Susumu">General Susumu</a>, <a href="deitydisplay3932.html?ItemName=Gorum">Gorum</a>, <a href="deitydisplay0731.html?ItemName=Shizuru">Shizuru</a>

Replacement Power: In campaigns that use the optional hero point system (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322), you gain Hero's Fortune (Advanced Player's Guide 324) as a bonus feat. Otherwise, you gain Marked for Glory (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 69) as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet its prerequisites. These replace the Glory domain's increased save DC when channeling positive energy. In addition, the following granted power replaces the divine presence power of the Glory domain.

Witness the Legend (Su): At 8th level, as a move action, you can extol the virtues of yourself or an ally within 60 feet that you can see. This causes the target to shed light like a torch for 1 minute, and while the effect lasts, you can expend a daily use of your touch of glory domain ability as an immediate action to add 1d6 to an attack, saving throw, skill check, or ability check attempted by the target; for a roll to confirm a critical hit or save against a fear effect, you instead add 1d12. You can use this ability once per day at 8th level and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 8th.

Replacement Domain Spells: 2nd-[aid](spell:aid), 3rd-[contagious zeal](spell:contagious zeal), 4th-[ righteous vigor](spell: righteous vigor), 6th-[ unshakable zeal](spell: unshakable zeal). If you are evil, replace the domain spells holy smite, holy sword, and holy aura with unholy blight, unholy sword, and unholy aura respectively.
