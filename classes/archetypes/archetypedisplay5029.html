These long-shot artists are masters at taking down
dragons with sharp shooting and light siege weaponry.
The following are class features for wyrm snipers.

Class Skills: A wyrm sniper adds Knowledge (arcana)
to her list of class skills, in addition to the normal
gunslinger class skills.

Artillery Proficiency: Wyrm snipers
are proficient with light siege engines, in
addition to the normal gunslinger weapon
proficiencies. See page 26 of this book for new
anti-dragon siege weaponry.

Deeds: A wyrm sniper swaps a trio of deeds for the
following deeds.



Munitions Master: At 7th level, a wyrm sniper can spend
1 grit point to reduce the number of full-round actions (or
move actions, if the sniper has the Master Siege Engineer
feat) required to load a light siege engine by 1. This deed
replaces the gunslinger's startling shot deed.



Skeleton Crew: At 11th level, as long as a wyrm sniper
has at least 1 grit point, she treats all light siege engines
as requiring a crew of one fewer than normal to operate
(minimum 1). This deed replaces the gunslinger's
lightning reload deed.



Anti-Air Targeting: At 15th level, whenever a wyrm
sniper targets a creature's wings with the targeting deed,
the wyrm sniper completely disables one of the creature's
wings on a successful hit. If the wyrm sniper hits her
target, the creature falls to the ground, regardless of
its altitude, taking the appropriate amount of falling
damage as a result. As long as the target has at least one
functioning wing, it may attempt a DC 20 Fly check to
gain the benefits of feather fall instead of plummeting to
the ground. In either case, it must succeed at a Reflex
save (DC 10 + 1/2 the wyrm sniper's level + the wyrm
sniper's Wisdom modifier) or fall prone when reaching
the ground. This ability replaces the gunslinger's
menacing shot deed.

Siege Commander (Ex): At 4th level, a wyrm sniper may
select the Siege Commander combat feat as her bonus
feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

Heavy Gunner (Ex): Starting at 5th level, a wyrm sniper
may select one specific type of light siege weapon (such
as a ballista or light bombard) in place of a specific type
of firearm as part of her gun training class ability. Every
4 levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), when she can pick
a new type of firearm for the gun training class ability,
the gunslinger may again select another type of light
siege engine.

Master Siege Engineer (Ex): At 12th level, a wyrm
sniper may select the Master Siege Engineer combat
feat as her bonus feat, even if she does not meet the
feat's prerequisites.
