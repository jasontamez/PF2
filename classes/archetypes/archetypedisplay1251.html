While some assassins and killers prefer to be up front with their poison use, others favor a covert approach. Needlers use subtlety and misdirection to deliver deadly poisons to unsuspecting victims in creative and unorthodox ways. This archetype is appropriate for rogues built using the rules from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook as well as for unchained rogues.

Adroit Poisoner (Ex): At 2nd level, a needler gains a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks. This bonus increases to +4 when the needler uses Sleight of Hand to draw a hidden weapon that is coated in poison. At 8th level, these bonuses increase to +4 and +6, respectively.

This replaces evasion.

Subtle Poisoning (Ex): At 4th level, a needler can apply a contact or ingested poison to her weapon and deliver it as if it were an injury poison. The poison must be delivered within 1 minute of this application, or it is wasted. The DC of the saving throw to resist the poison decreases by 1 when the needler uses this ability to deliver a contact or ingested poison via injury.

This replaces uncanny dodge.

Needle Poisoner (Ex): At 6th level, a needler can apply a dose of poison to a weapon as a swift action. This ability counts as swift poisoning for the purpose of meeting prerequisites.

This replaces the rogue talent gained at 6th level.

Concealed Delivery (Ex): At 8th level, a needler learns how to deliver all types of poisons with subtlety. As a standard action, she can deliver an ingested or inhaled poison to a creature within reach by placing a dose of poison on the target's lips, on the target's neck, or through other similar contact with the target's skin as if the poison were a contact poison. Delivering poison in this way requires a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by the target's Perception check. The poison is not lost on a failed check, but it must be successfully delivered within 1 minute of the first attempt, or it is wasted.

This replaces improved uncanny dodge.
