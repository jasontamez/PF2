The influence of primal magic extends beyond what is visible and material. Spirits that linger in areas where primal magic reigns can become warped, losing touch with their former selves and experiencing random surges of power. A shaman who communes with such spirits learns to stabilize these erratic energies and draw upon them to her benefit. Such shamans gradually learn to guide their spirits toward coherence and lucidity, and in the process learn to bend chance and fortune in their favor.

Spirit Animal: A primal warden's spirit animal exhibits unusual physical features for a creature of its type, such as unnatural colorations and extra or missing appendages. Each day, the spirit animal gains resistance 10 against a random element. Roll 1d4 to determine the type of resistance (1 = acid, 2 = cold, 3 = electricity, 4 = fire).

This replaces the abilities the shaman's spirit animal gains from the shaman's chosen spirit.

Unstable Spellcasting: A primal warden's spirit is ever shifting, and the spells it grants the primal warden change from moment to moment.

When the primal warden would spontaneously cast a 1st-through- 8th-level spell using the spirit magic class feature, she produces a random spell from the list of shaman spells on page 48 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide of 1 spell level higher than the spell slot expended; use an appropriate die or another randomization method to determine the spell. When she would spontaneously cast a 9th-level spell using spirit magic, she instead casts a random 9th-level spell from the shaman spell list in the Advanced Class Guide, treating her caster level as 2 higher. There is no way to predict the spell before the shaman begins casting it using spirit magic, and she cannot enhance the spell using metamagic feats. The spell uses the shaman's caster level, even if that caster level would normally be too low to cast the spell. There are 47 potential 2nd-level spells, 46 potential 3rd-level spells, 41 potential 4th-level spells, 30 potential 5th-level spells, 22 potential 6th-level spells, 22 potential 7th-level spells, 18 potential 8th-level spells, and 14 potential 9th-level spells.

At 8th level, after determining the spell that she would cast using spirit magic, once per day as a free action, the primal warden shaman can choose to randomly select another spell instead, using the same method of randomization as she used before (if she obtains the same result a second time, she must keep that result). At 12th level and every 4 shaman levels thereafter, she can choose to randomly select a different spirit magic spell one additional time per day, up to a maximum of four times per day at 20th level. She cannot use this ability more than once in the same round.

This alters spirit magic and replaces the hex gained at 8th level.

Hexes: A primal warden shaman gains the hexes below at the specified levels.

A primal warden shaman cannot select the chant hex, the evil eye hex, the misfortune hex, or any witch hexes. This alters hexes and replaces the hexes gained at 4th and 12th levels.

Primal Blessing (Su): At 4th level, the shaman gains the ability to channel primal magic into a target within 30 feet. Roll 1d4 to determine the effect. On a result of 1, the target takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. On a result of 2, the target's size is enlarged or reduced, as per enlarge person or reduce person, and the effect functions even if the target is not a humanoid; roll randomly to determine the effect. On a result of 3, the target gains a foot enhancement bonus to her base speed. On a result of 4, all attacks against the target suffer a 20% miss chance. The effects of this hex last for 1 minute. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Greater Primal Blessing (Su): At 12th level, the shaman's primal blessing hex improves. This functions as the primal blessing hex in all ways, except that the shaman has a chance to bestow greater benefits upon her targets. Roll 1d6 to determine the effect. On a result of 1-4, refer to the primal blessing ability to determine the effect. On a roll of 5, the target gains a  luck bonus on attack rolls and saving throws and to her Armor Class. On a roll of 6, the target gains the benefit of the haste spell, using the primal warden's shaman level as her caster level.
