The best spies are like chameleons, but not only can they change their appearances to fit the situation, they can also change their personalities, allegiances, and even loves if that's what it takes to achieve their clandestine goals. Spies are the ultimate manipulators, and even those who commission their services sometimes find that they've merely served the spies' own interests.

Skilled Liar (Ex):  Whenever a spy uses Bluff to attempt to deceive someone, she gains a bonus on the opposed roll equal to 1/2 her rogue level (minimum +1). This bonus does not apply to feint attempts or attempts to pass secret messages. This ability replaces trapfinding.

Poison Use (Ex):  A 3rd level, a spy is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a blade. This ability replaces trap sense.

Rogue Talents:  The following rogue talents complement the spy archetype: canny observer, guileful polyglot, honeyed words, major magic*, minor magic*, and quick disguise.

Advanced Talents:  The following advanced rogue talents complement the spy archetype: crippling strike*, master of disguise, and stealthy sniper.
