While most fighters rely on physical fitness and rigorous training to achieve martial superiority, a few prefer to create and imbibe dangerous concoctions that mutate them into fearsome creatures.

Mutagen (Su):  At 3rd level, a mutation warrior discovers how to create a mutagen that he can imbibe in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality. This ability functions as the alchemist's mutagen ability (Advanced Player's Guide 28), using his fighter level as his alchemist level. This ability replaces armor training 1.

Mutagen Discovery (Su):  At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the mutation warrior can choose one of the following alchemist discoveries (Advanced Player's Guide 28) to augment his abilities: feral mutagen, grand mutagen, greater mutagen, infuse mutagen, nauseating flesh, preserve organs, rag doll mutagen, spontaneous healing, tentacle, vestigial arm, wings. The mutagen warrior uses his fighter level as his effective alchemist level for the purpose of these discoveries. This ability replaces armor training 2, 3, 4, and armor mastery.
