The natural world is full of bodiless nature spirits connected to the forces of glades, springs, and individual plants. Some druids hear their call keenly and are able to effortlessly incarnate them as the miniature creatures known as leshys (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 176). The leshy warden serves as these spirits' ally, defender, and voice.

Leshy Familiar (Ex):  A leshy warden forms an intimate bond with a nature spirit, incarnating the spirit as a leaf leshy (Bestiary 3 179). She gains a leaf leshy as a familiar and treats her druid level as her effective wizard level for the purpose of this ability. If the leshy dies, the leshy warden can incarnate the same spirit again by paying the normal cost to replace a familiar. So long as the leshy lives, the leshy warden gains access to the Plant domain as if through a druid's nature bond class feature, but she can't choose the Decay subdomain.

This replaces nature bond.

Green Empathy (Ex):  A leshy warden can improve the attitude of a plant creature as if using wild empathy. The typical wild plant creature has a starting attitude of indifferent. If the plant creature is mindless, the leshy warden imparts a modicum of intellect to the plant so that it can be interacted with as if it were an animal. A leshy warden can also use this ability to influence an animal, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check to do so.

This replaces wild empathy.

Leshy Summoner (Ex):  A leshy warden is an expert at summoning and growing leshys. She counts as a plant creature for the purpose of growing leshys. She adds leaf leshys, gourd leshys, fungus leshys, seaweed leshys, and lotus leshys to her list of creatures she can summon with summon nature's ally I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively.

This alters spontaneous casting.

Leshy Tender (Ex):  At 4th level, a leshy warden can either grant her leaf leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a gourd leshy. At 8th level, the leshy warden can either grant her current leshy a +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a fungus leshy. At 12th level, she can either grant her current leshy a final +2 increase to Strength and Dexterity or transform it into a seaweed leshy. If the leshy is transformed, it gains the normal ability scores of its new form; ability score increases granted by this ability don't carry over to its new form.

This replaces resist nature's lure.

Wild Shape (Su):  A leshy warden gains this ability at 6th level, except her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level - 2 for the purpose of determining the number of times per day she can use it. At 6th level, the leshy warden can assume the form of only Small or Medium plant creatures, as per plant shape I. At 8th level, she can take the form of a Large plant creature, as per plant shape II. At 10th level, she can take the form of a Huge plant creature, as per plant shape III.

This alters wild shape.

Plant Whisperer (Su):  At 13th level, a leshy warden's connection to the spirits of nature becomes strong enough that she can always hear them whispering. She is treated as if constantly under the effects of speak with plants. Once per day, she can spend 10 minutes in communion with the spirits to learn the answers to her questions, as commune with nature.

This replaces a thousand faces.
