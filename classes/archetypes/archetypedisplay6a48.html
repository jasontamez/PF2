The colluding scoundrel is a canny and conniving skirmisher, manipulating her enemies and leveraging her allies for her own benefit. A Free Captain ordering her crew to occupy foes and thus expose the enemy to her attacks might take this archetype, and colluding scoundrels have proven to be formidable members of the Wasp Queens, as their giant wasp companions draw out opponents to fall under the Wasp Queens' stinging blades. In any case, the colluding scoundrel rarely concerns herself overmuch with her allies' well-being.

Scapegoat (Ex): A colluding scoundrel is adept at redirecting a foe's hostility toward another creature, creating openings for her own attacks. A number of times per day equal to her hunter level, as a swift action, she can target one foe within 30 feet and designate one willing ally adjacent to that foe as a scapegoat. For the following minute, the target takes a -2 penalty on attacks against any creature other than the designated scapegoat, and the target has a 10% spell failure chance on spells that don't target the scapegoat or include the scapegoat in their area of effect. The penalty increases to -4 at 8th level and -6 at 15th level.

The colluding scoundrel can designate her animal companion as a scapegoat without it counting against her daily uses of this ability.

This is a mind-affecting effect. The effect ends if the colluding scoundrel falls unconscious or is slain.

This replaces animal focus.

Backstabber (Ex): At 8th level, a colluding scoundrel deals 2d6 additional points of damage on attacks against a target threatened by an ally currently designated as the scapegoat. This increases to 3d6 points of damage at 15th level. This is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit, but it does stack with sneak attack and similar effects.

This replaces second animal focus.

Master Backstabber (Ex): At 20th level, a colluding scoundrel is a master at dispatching distracted targets. As a standard action, she can make a single attack against a foe that is taking the penalties of her scapegoat ability and is adjacent to an ally currently designated as the scapegoat. If the attack hits, the target takes damage normally and must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the colluding scoundrel's level + her Wisdom modifier) or be slain. Whether or not the target succeeds, it cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any colluding scoundrel) for 24 hours.

This replaces master hunter.
