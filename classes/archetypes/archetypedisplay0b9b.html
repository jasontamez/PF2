Precocious Companion

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 188</a>
Precocious companions are able to learn far more tricks than other companions; this ability to learn allows their masters to use them for a wider variety of tasks.

Expanded Tricks (Ex): At 3rd level, a precocious companion gains twice as many bonus tricks as normal for an animal companion. A hunter's animal companion can't use the additional bonus tricks to learn hunter's tricks. At 15th level, the DC of the Handle Animal check to push a precocious companion to perform an unlearned trick is only 15, instead of 25.

This replaces evasion and improved evasion.

Perspicacious Mind (Ex): At 4th or 7th level, whenever the precocious companion would normally gain the choice of a listed score advancement or a +2 bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, it instead gains a +2 bonus to its Intelligence score and a +4 bonus to its Wisdom and Charisma scores.

This replaces the 4th- or 7th-level ability score advancement.
