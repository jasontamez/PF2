Charlatans and stage magicians use slight of hand to fake magic. A counterfeit mage goes a step further, parroting the motions and activation phrases used by arcane casters to activate wands or other magical accoutrements. While counterfeit mages rarely fool a real wizard, their command of the arcane is enough to convince most lay people.

Magical Expertise (Ex):  At 1st level, a counterfeit mage adds 1/2 his level to Disable Device checks to disarm magical traps, Perception checks to find magical traps, and Use Magic Device checks to activate scrolls and wands. A counterfeit mage can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. This ability replaces trapfinding.

Signature Wand (Ex):  At 4th level, a counterfeit mage can spend 1 hour practicing with a wand to designate it as his signature wand. He can draw that wand as a free action, and can activate it without having to succeed at a Use Magic Device check. He can change his signature wand once per day. This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 4th level.

Wand Adept (Ex):  At 6th level, a counterfeit mage can use his Dexterity modifier in place of his Charisma modifier when attempting Use Magic Device checks to activate wands.

Rogue Talents:  The following rogue talents complement the counterfeit mage archetype: deft palm, esoteric scholar, honeyed words, major magic, minor magic, and trap spotter.

Advanced Talents:  The following advanced rogue talents complement the counterfeit mage archetype: dispelling attack, familiar, and slippery mind.
