Most cavaliers are great tacticians, but some stand above the rest for their ability to lead troops under their command, and inspire them to great accomplishments. Those cavaliers most gifted at command often become daring generals.

Aides-de-Camp (Ex): A daring general gains a modified version of the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat at 6th level, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. All followers that the daring general gains as a result of this version of the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat can only have levels in the warrior class. All cohorts that the daring general gains from this ability must have levels only in classes that grant a full base attack bonus (such as barbarian, fighter, paladin, or ranger), and must be at least 4 levels lower than the daring general himself. However, at 12th level and 18th level, the daring general gains an additional cohort (up to a maximum of three cohorts at 18th level) and a number of additional followers equal to the number of followers he gained from the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat (up to a maximum of triple his normal number of followers at 18th level). When determining the kinds of cohorts the daring general can attract, he treats his Leadership score as 3 lower for each subsequent cohort (effectively taking a -3 penalty for the second cohort and a -6 penalty for the third cohort).

Additionally, the daring general can grant special roles to his cohorts, as outlined below. Unless otherwise stated, only one cohort can fill any given role at any given time. Designating a cohort as filling a special role requires a 24-hour ceremonial ritual.

Groom: The groom cares for the daring general's mount. She does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding the cavalier's mount. Additionally, once per day, the groom can spend 10 minutes preparing the daring general's mount for battle. If she does, the mount's speed increases by 10 feet and its Dexterity score increases by 2. These benefits last for 1 hour.

Squire: The squire's main task is to care for the daring general's arms and armor. If the squire aids the daring general in donning his armor, it takes half as much time to don as it would if someone else aided the daring general. Additionally, when the squire is adjacent to the daring general, as a standard action, she can grant a +2 bonus to the daring general's AC against the first attack made against the daring general before the squire's next turn. This counts as an application of the aid another action, but the squire does not need to threaten the attacker in question.

Standard Bearer: The daring general's standard bearer can carry his banner in his stead, granting the benefits of his banner ability (and later, his greater banner ability) to all allies within 60 feet of the standard bearer. If the standard bearer becomes unconscious or dead, she ceases to grant these benefits.

Beyond the rules noted above, if the daring general uses his followers to create an army using the <a href="rules834a.html?Name=Mass%20Combat&amp;Category=Kingdoms%20and%20War">mass combat</a> rules, that army starts with one extra <a href="rules9efb.html?Name=Army%20Tactics&amp;Category=Mass%20Combat">tactic</a> of the daring general's choice and a +2 bonus to its morale score.

The daring general can assign each of his followers individually to serve as either footmen or honor guards (described below). He does not need to assign either role to a given follower, if he prefers. He can change the role of a follower at any time, but it takes 1 day per level for the follower to change her tactics to suit her new role. Followers with a particular role must group together with other followers with the same role to form an army in mass combat.

Footman: Each follower gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, but takes a -2 penalty to her AC and on saving throws. A footman unit gains a +2 bonus to its OM and takes a -2 penalty to its DV in mass combat.

Honor Guard: The follower gains a +2 bonus to her AC and on saving throws, but takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. An honor guard unit gains a +2 bonus to its DV and takes a -2 penalty to its OM in mass combat.

This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.

Shared Challenge (Ex): At 12th level, when a daring general issues a challenge, his followers and cohorts take up that challenge alongside him. Whenever the daring general uses his challenge class feature, as long as the challenge remains in effect, each of the daring general's followers and cohorts that are within 30 feet of him gain a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of his challenge.

This ability replaces demanding challenge.

Supreme Tactician (Ex): At 20th level, whenever the daring general uses his tactician ability, he can grant any number of teamwork feats that he knows to his allies, and when he uses his tactician ability as a standard action in combat, it does not count against his daily uses of tactician. This ability replaces supreme charge.
