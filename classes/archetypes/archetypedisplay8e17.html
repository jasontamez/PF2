Faith Singer

Faith singers show their faith in their deity with songs or other appropriate performances.

Faithful: Like a cleric, a faith singer must worship a deity, and his alignment must be within one step of his deity's alignment.

Devout Spell Knowledge (Su): At 2nd level, a faith singer can select one <a href="_clericdomains.html">domain</a> from among those belonging to his deity. Once per day as a spell-like ability using his bard level as his caster level, he can cast the 1st-level domain spell while giving a bardic performance. At 6th level, and every 4 bard levels thereafter, he can similarly cast the next-higher domain spell as a spell-like ability (to a maximum of the 5th-level domain spell at bard level 18th). He can use each spell-like ability only once per day.

This ability replaces versatile performance.
