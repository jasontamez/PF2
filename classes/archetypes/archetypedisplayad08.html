A mooncaller is bound to the subtle influences of the ever-changing moon and its endless cycles from light to dark and back again.

Night Sight (Ex):  At 2nd level, a mooncaller gains low-light vision. If she already has low-light vision, she gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. If she already has darkvision, the range of her darkvision is increased by 30 feet. This ability replaces woodland stride.

Resist Call of the Wild (Ex):  At 4th level, a mooncaller gains a +4 bonus on saving throws to avoid confusion, daze, feeblemind, and insanity effects. She also gains a +4 bonus against the exceptional, spell-like, and supernatural abilities of creatures with the shapechanger subtype. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Purity of Body (Ex):  At 9th level, a mooncaller gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases. This ability replaces venom immunity.

Wolfsbane (Su):  At 13th level, a mooncaller gains DR 3/silver, increasing to DR 4/silver at 16th level and DR 5/silver at 19th level. This ability replaces a thousand faces.
