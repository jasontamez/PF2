While many rangers use bows and arrows, the toxophilite takes special pride in her skill at archery. The toxophilite emulates the sharpshooting rangers of legend, who could pin a fly to the wall with a single shot or split one arrow with another. A truly talented toxophilite can even shoot down an enemy's arrow while it's still in flight.

Arrow-Splitter (Ex):  A toxophilite gains a +1 bonus on ranged attack rolls against creatures or objects two or more size categories smaller than her. The toxophilite's ranged attacks also deal full damage to objects instead of half damage. This ability replaces wild empathy.

Combat Style Feat (Ex):  At 2nd level, a toxophilite must select one of two ranged combat styles to pursue: archery or crossbow.

Intercept Arrow (Ex):  At 3rd level, a toxophilite can ready a ranged attack to deflect a ranged weapon attack against her or an ally within 30 feet. To deflect the attack, the toxophilite makes an attack with a ranged weapon. If her attack roll is greater than the attacking opponent's roll, the opponent's initial attack automatically misses. For each size category the attacking creature is larger than the toxophilite, the toxophilite takes a -4 penalty on her attack roll. The toxophilite must declare the use of this ability after the attack is announced, but before the roll is made. Unusually massive ranged weapons, such as boulders or ballista bolts, and ranged attacks by firearms or generated by natural attacks or spell effects can't be deflected. This ability replaces endurance.

Improved Intercept (Ex):  At 11th level, when the toxophilite takes a full-attack action with a ranged weapon, she can choose to forgo one of her attacks. If she does so, she can use her intercept arrow ability as an immediate action instead of a readied action at any time before her next turn. Her attack roll to intercept uses the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forgo during her previous action. This ability replaces quarry.

Greater Intercept (Ex):  At 19th level, whenever a toxophilite successfully def lects an attack with her intercept arrow ability, she can redirect the attack against a target within 30 feet, using the intercepted attack's attack roll against the new target's AC. This ability replaces improved quarry.
