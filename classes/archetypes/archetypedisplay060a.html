A speaker for the past is a shaman who specifically serves as the voice for spirits from her people's history. A speaker for the past is often an advocate of the ancestors of a specific group, the voice of experience, and a powerful resource that allows the past to aid the present.

Mysteries of the Past:  A speaker for the past gains Linguistics, Knowledge (history), Knowledge (local), Perception, and Use Magic Device as class skills. She also adds the spells from the ancestor and time oracle mysteries to her class spell list (as the cleric level for those spells).

This ability replaces the shaman's familiar. The speaker for the past must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation to regain her daily allotment of spells, but does not need to commune with a familiar during this time. Because she has no familiar, she does not gain a spirit familiar feature from any spirit she bonds with.

Revelations of the Past:  At 4th, 6th, 12th, 14th, and 20th levels, the speaker for the past can select a revelation from the ancestor or time mysteries. She uses her shaman level as her oracle level for these revelations, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of her Charisma modifier for the purposes of the revelation. This ability replaces wandering spirit and wandering hex.
