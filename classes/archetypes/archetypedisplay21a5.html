Blood conduits learn to channel their arcane might directly through their flesh, without the need for mystical words or gestures.

Contact Specialist (Ex):  At 1st level, a blood conduit selects a bonus feat from the following: <a href="featdisplay34d3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a>, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Reposition">Improved Reposition</a>, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip</a>, and <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>. He does not need to meet the prerequisites to take this feat. He also adds those feats to his list of bloodline feats. This ability replaces fast movement and alters bloodline feats.

Spell Conduit (Su):  At 5th level, as long as a blood conduit is wearing light or no armor, he can deliver bloodrager spells with a range of touch through bodily contact. When he succeeds at a combat maneuver check to bull rush, grapple, pin, reposition, or trip an opponent, or makes an unarmed strike against an enemy, he can as a swift action cast a touch spell on the creature that he affected with the combat maneuver, requiring no further touch attack roll. If this spell would usually require a successful touch attack, his successful combat maneuver check counts as this attack. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.

Reflexive Conduit (Ex):  At 14th level, a blood conduit can discharge his power into foes that attempt bodily contact with him. While wearing light or no armor, when the blood conduit is subject to a combat maneuver check made to bull rush, grapple, pin, reposition, or trip him, as an immediate action he can target his attacker with a bloodrager spell that has a range of touch. If the spell would normally require a touch attack, a blood conduit can attempt a combat maneuver check for this attack instead. This ability replaces indomitable will.
