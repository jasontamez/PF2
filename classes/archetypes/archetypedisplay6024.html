The Tekritanin League facilitated trade and settled disputes between a vast array of diverse cultures. The arbiters were the first line of diplomatic defense, solving problems before they could become disruptive.

Tekritanin (Ex): A Tekritanin arbiter gains Tekritanin as a bonus language. Tekritanin is a fluid and evolving hybrid tongue which shares roots with many modern languages. When the arbiter speaks Tekritanin, any creature that speaks a common Inner Sea human language will understand him well enough to allow the arbiter to use the Diplomacy skill or affect the creature with language-dependent effects. At the GM's discretion, some human languages might be too divergent or unrelated to Tekritanin to use this ability immediately. In this case, the arbiter must interact with creatures speaking the language for at least 1 hour to permanently apply this ability to the foreign language. A Tekritanin arbiter adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to Linguistics checks.

This replaces trapfinding.

Expert Mediator (Ex): A Tekritanin arbiter learns to forge lasting harmony between enemies. At 2nd level, whenever the arbiter uses the Diplomacy skill to improve the starting attitude of a creature, that attitude shift lasts for 24 hours instead of 1d4 hours, barring any circumstance or event that causes it to be decreased. If the arbiter spends 1 minute continuously interacting with a creature, he can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the creature's Bluff skill bonus) to identify the creature's starting attitude (per the Diplomacy skill) in regard to all other creatures present (including himself ). With this understanding, the arbiter can use the Diplomacy skill to improve a target's attitude toward any other creature present. This functions as if using the Diplomacy skill to improve the target's attitude toward the arbiter, but instead uses the Diplomacy DC determined by the target's starting attitude toward the creature of the arbiter's choosing.

This replaces poison lore.

Hidden Meaning (Ex): A Tekritanin arbiter's deep knowledge of language provides him protection from effects that require communication. At 2nd level, he gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against language-dependent effects. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and to +6 at 8th level. At 11th level, he gains immunity to language-dependent effects.

This replaces poison resistance.

Fluent Speaker (Ex): At 3rd level, a Tekritanin arbiter learns to speak one language with the skill of a native speaker. He chooses one language he knows and gains a +1 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as an individual native to any region where the language is primarily spoken. In addition, he gains a +1 bonus on both Diplomacy checks to change initial attitudes and Sense Motive checks to detect falsehoods when dealing with individuals with the selected language as their native language. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1 and the Tekritanin arbiter can select one additional language that his bonuses apply to, up to a maximum of +6 each for six languages at 18th level.

This replaces trap sense.
