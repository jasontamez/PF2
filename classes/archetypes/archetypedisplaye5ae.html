The visionary is a master at divination, drawing upon her intimate relationship with the spirit world to ferret out all manner of secrets and insights about the world around her and beyond.

Bonus Feat:  At 4th level, the visionary gains Diviner's Delving as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

Discern Magical Expertise (Ex):  At 4th level, the shaman can determine what type of spellcasting expertise a creature possesses by studying the creature for 2 rounds with detect magic or any of the following spells: detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect law (if the creature belongs to the alignment). This ability tells the visionary what bloodlines, domains, hexes, schools, or mysteries (if any) the creature possesses. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the shaman's level + the shaman's Wisdom modifier). A creature affected by this ability cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. This ability functions through magical sensors as with clairaudience/clairvoyance and scrying. This ability replaces wandering spirit gained at 4th level.

Vision Spirit Magic:  At 4th level, the visionary adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: see alignment (1st), see invisibility (2nd), clairaudience/clairvoyance (3rd), detect scrying (4th), prying eyes (5th), legend lore (6th), vision (7th), moment of prescience (8th), foresight (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman's wandering spirit.

Improved Divination (Su):  At 6th level, the visionary becomes more adept at divination magic. When she casts the augury spell, her chance for an accurate answer is automatically the maximum of 90%. Likewise, when she casts divination, she has the maximum 90% chance of an accurate answer.

Finally, the visionary can prepare scrying as a 4th-level spell, and it requires only 1 minute to cast. The visionary also has a 10% chance per caster level to cast the spells listed in the scrying spell description, instead of 5% per caster level (to a maximum of 100%).

The visionary must still prepare these spells to receive these benefits. This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.

Wandering Spirit (Su):  At 12th level, the visionary forms a temporary bond with another spirit (other than the one she selected using her spirit class feature). This is identical to the 4th-level shaman class feature. This adds the wandering spirit magic spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic, along with vision spirit magic and her original spirit. At 20th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. This ability replaces the greater version of wandering spirit gained at 12th level and true version of wandering spirit gained at 20th level.
