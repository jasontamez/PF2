The bold schemer combines wrath, wits, and daring to win battles and wars in unconventional ways, often through infiltration and deception. If raw force of arms is insufficient, she improvises ways to pull victory from the jaws of defeat.

Skills: A bold schemer gains Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth as class skills, instead of Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), and Knowledge (planes). Her bardic knowledge does not apply to those skills.

This ability alters the skald's class skills and bardic knowledge.

Skald of Twists and Turns (Su): At 4th level, a bold schemer becomes increasingly adept at infiltration and devising cunning strategies to overcome enemy fortifications.

A bold schemer can spend 8 hours observing a physical location (such as a fortress, a walled city, or perhaps even a section of an underground dungeon or cavern complex), contemplating methods to infiltrate the location and engage its defenders in battle in ways that subvert their defensive advantages.

At the end of the 8 hours, the bold schemer gains a +2 insight bonus on her Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth checks while in that same physical location. This bonus increases by 2 at 8th level and every 4 skald levels thereafter, to a maximum of +10 at 20th level. The bonus lasts until the bold schemer observes a new location. While observing a location, the bold schemer must fully focus her attention; any distractions, such as engaging in combat, immediately ends the observation and the bold schemer must start a new period of observing a physical location to receive the bonus.

This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and damage reduction.

Bold Strategy (Su): At 10th level, a bold schemer can tailor her plans and observations so they are able to assist her allies as well. As long as they can see or hear the bold schemer while inside the observed location, all of her allies gain half the insight bonus she gains from the skald of twists and turns ability.

This ability replaces dirge of doom.
