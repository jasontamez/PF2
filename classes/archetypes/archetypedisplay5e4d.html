Rough rampagers venerate Rovagug, reveling in the destruction the dark god represents. Where others seek power, wealth, or revenge, the rough rampager merely focuses on slaughter and mayhem. Because of their sheer destructive nature, most rough rampagers live short, brutal lives swathed in blood and carnage before someone puts them to the blade. Legends speak of dozens of rough rampagers wreaking havoc when Rovagug's spawn escape, acting as heralds and harbingers of the greater destruction created by the Rough Beast's terrifying children.

Aura of Blood (Su):  At 3rd level, a rough rampager radiates a palpably daunting aura that causes all enemies within 10 feet to take a -4 penalty on Constitution or Heal checks to stop bleed damage and checks to stabilize while dying. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious. This ability replaces aura of cowardice.

Aura of Putrefaction (Su):  At 8th level, a rough rampager radiates an aura that causes the wounds of enemies within 10 feet to weep blood. Injured enemies in the area take 1 point of bleed damage per round. This ability functions only while the antipaladin is conscious. This ability replaces aura of despair.

Aura of Quietus (Su):  At 14th level, a rough rampager radiates an aura that causes the failure of healing spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used to restore enemies within 10 feet of him. This is not an antimagic field, however, and ongoing or passive effects are not affected. Casters can overcome this ability with a successful caster level check versus the rough rampager's class level + 11. This ability replaces aura of sin.
