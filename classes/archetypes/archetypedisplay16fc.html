The phalanx soldier specializes in defensive tactics, using his shield to guard himself and his allies and forming a shield wall like an unbreakable anvil against which his enemies break.

Stand Firm (Ex):  At 2nd level, a phalanx soldier gains a +1 bonus to CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. This bonus also applies on saves against trample attacks. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

Phalanx Fighting (Ex):  At 3rd level, when a phalanx soldier wields a shield, he can use any polearm or spear of his size as a one-handed weapon. This ability replaces armor training 1.

Ready Pike (Ex):  At 5th level, a phalanx soldier can, once per day, ready a weapon with the brace property as an immediate action, gaining a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. For every four levels beyond 5th, this bonus increases by +1, and he can use the ability one additional time per day. He cannot use this ability when flat-footed. This ability replaces weapon training 1.

Deft Shield (Ex):  At 7th level, the armor check penalty from a shield and the attack roll penalty are reduced by -1 for a phalanx soldier using a tower shield. At 11th level, these penalties are reduced by -2. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 3.

Shield Ally (Ex):  At 9th level, when a phalanx fighter is using a heavy or tower shield, he can, as a move action, provide partial cover (+2 cover bonus to AC, +1 bonus on Reflex saves) to himself and all adjacent allies until the beginning of his next turn.

At 13th level, he can instead provide cover (+4 cover bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) and evasion (as a rogue) to one adjacent ally until the beginning of his next turn. This cover does not allow Stealth checks.

At 17th level, he can provide cover to himself and all adjacent allies, or he can provide improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves, improved evasion) to a single adjacent ally. This ability replaces weapon training 2, 3, and 4.

Irresistible Advance (Ex):  At 15th level, a phalanx fighter gains a bonus on bull rush and overrun CMB checks. This bonus depends on the type of shield used: +1 with a buckler, +2 with a light shield, +3 with a heavy shield, or +4 with a tower shield. This ability replaces armor training 4.

Shielded Fortress (Ex):  At 20th level, a phalanx fighter's shield cannot be disarmed or sundered. He gains evasion (as a rogue) when using a shield (improved evasion when using a tower shield). As a move action, a phalanx fighter can provide evasion to all adjacent allies until the beginning of his next turn. As an immediate action, he can provide improved evasion to an adjacent ally against one attack. This ability replaces weapon mastery.
