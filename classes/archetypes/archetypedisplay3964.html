Frozen shadows belong to a rare ninja clan operating in Avistan, having migrated to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings decades ago. Most members are Tian, Ulfen, and Varki humans, and they work as thieves, power brokers, and spies loosely guided by secretive masters with unknown agendas.

Class Skills: A frozen shadow adds Survival to his list of class skills, instead of Diplomacy.

This ability alters the ninja's class skills.

Hardy Killer (Ex): At 2nd level, a frozen shadow has become incredibly inured to his surrounding climate. At the beginning of any day, the frozen shadow can spend 1 point from his ki pool to benefit from the effects of an endure elements spell. The frozen shadow does not treat any Acrobatics skill check to jump as if he had a running start, and at 10th level he cannot reduce the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by half.

This ability alters ki pool.

Track Victim (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a frozen shadow adds half his ninja level on Survival checks to follow tracks and on Perception checks to see through disguises. Additionally, if the frozen shadow sees a creature that has changed its appearance using the Disguise skill, he can always attempt a Perception check to see through the disguise, even if the disguised creature did nothing to draw attention to itself. The frozen shadow also gains a +2 bonus to Will saving throws when attempting to disbelieve an illusion affecting a creature or creatures.

This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

Swift Tracker (Ex): At 8th level, a frozen shadow can move at his normal speed while using Survival to follow tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving up to twice his normal speed while tracking. Additionally, his bonus on Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions affecting a creature or creatures increases to +4.

This replaces improved uncanny dodge.
