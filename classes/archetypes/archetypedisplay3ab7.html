Spun off into the endless circle of life, an incarnate druid is an embodiment of nature's eternal renewal. She lives many lives and wanders the world devoid of attachments, a stranger to all yet one with all life.

Mysterious Stranger (Ex):  At 2nd level, a reincarnated druids adds 1/2 her druid level to the DC of Sense Motive, Diplomacy, and Knowledge checks to learn about her. This ability replaces woodland stride.

Resist Death's Touch (Ex):  At 4th level, a reincarnated druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and necromancy effects, and on stabilization checks when dying. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Many Lives (Ex):  At 5th level, if a reincarnated druid is killed, she may automatically reincarnate (as the spell) 1 day later. The reincarnated druid appears in a safe location within 1 mile of her previous body. At will for the next 7 days, she can sense the presence of her remains as if using locate object as a spell-like ability. If she is killed during these 7 days, she remains dead and does not reincarnate. The many lives ability does not function ifthe reincarnated druid is slain by a death effect. A reincarnated druid cannot be raised from the dead or resurrected, though she can be reincarnated.

Wild Shape (Su):  A reincarnated druid gains this ability at 6th level, and it functions at her druid level - 2.

Cheat Death (Ex):  At 9th level, once per day, a reincarnated druid may reroll a save against a death effect, energy drain, or necromancy effect before the result of the roll is revealed, or reroll a failed stabilization check while dying. She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse than the original roll. This ability replaces venom immunity.

Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex):  At 15th level, a reincarnated druid can speak with any living creature. This ability replaces timeless body.
