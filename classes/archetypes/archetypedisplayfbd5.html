In distant Tian Xia, herbalists practice an obscure alchemical art known as Pei Zin herbalism, which involves medicinal and restorative techniques that are used throughout much of that continent. A few practitioners develop a talent for Pei Zin that transcends ordinary alchemy, allowing them to blur the line between applying alchemical medicine and coaxing divine miracles.

Like other masters of the art, Pei Zin practitioners can use the Profession (herbalist) skill in place of Craft (alchemy) to create alchemical remedies with recipes that include certain plant-derived reagents. More information is on pages 24-25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual.

Master Herbalist (Su): A Pei Zin practitioner has mastered countless alchemical techniques that supplement her divine powers and greatly aid her when she heals the sick and wounded. She gains a competence bonus on Profession (herbalist) checks equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1), and uses her Charisma modifier in place of her Wisdom modifier when attempting Profession (herbalist) checks. Additionally, a Pei Zin practitioner can identify potions as if via detect magic using Profession (herbalist) instead of Spellcraft, and she can attempt such a check after holding a potion for 1 round.

This ability replaces the additional class skills the oracle gains from her mystery.

Healer's Way (Su): A Pei Zin practitioner combines alchemy, acupuncture, and divine magic to heal wounds by touch. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier. With one use of this ability, she uses positive energy to heal the target of 1d6 hit points for every 2 oracle levels she has. Using this ability is a standard action unless the oracle targets herself, in which case it is a swift action. Using this ability requires only one free hand. This ability counts as a paladin's lay on hands ability for the purposes of feats, spells, and effects that work with that class feature when it is used for healing purposes. Unlike lay on hands, this ability cannot be used to harm undead.

This ability replaces the revelation gained at 1st level.

Master Healing Technique (Su): At 7th level, whenever a Pei Zin practitioner heals a living creature with her healer's way ability, as a free action she can attempt a Profession (herbalist) check to remove a condition from the target, with each condition having an accompanying Profession (herbalist) DC (see the list below). She cannot take 10 or 20 on this check, nor can she receive aid from any creature except another Pei Zin practitioner (though the practitioner need not be an oracle; see pages 24-25 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Alchemy Manual). Failure by 5 or more causes the target to become sickened for 1 round (if the Pei Zin practitioner is attempting to remove the sickened condition, this extends it by 1 round). Similarly, failure by 10 or more instead causes the target to become nauseated for 1 round or to have its existing nauseated condition extended by 1 round. A creature that cannot be sickened or nauseated cannot have conditions removed by this ability.

Minor Conditions (DC 20): Fatigued, shaken, and sickened.

Major Conditions (DC 25): Dazed and staggered.

Severe Conditions (DC 30): Confused, exhausted, frightened, and nauseated.

Dire Conditions (DC 35): Blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned.

This ability replaces the revelation gained at 7th level.

Recommended Mysteries: Life, nature, succor.
