Clocksmith

Clocksmiths are oddities among wizard communities, pursuing the study and creation of clockwork constructs to near obsession. These wizards favor mechanical experiments over other arcane pursuits.

Clockwork Bond (Ex): A clocksmith forms a bond with one of his clockwork creations and begins play with a constructed familiar. He must select this familiar as his arcane bond. The constructed familiar functions as a typical familiar of its type except as noted here. The construct familiar is always a construct with the clockwork subtype. A construct familiar grants only half of its typical bonus (minimum +1 bonus) from its special familiar ability to its master.

This alters arcane bond.

Clockwork Expertise (Ex): A clocksmith is especially adept at dealing with clockworks. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects created by creatures of the clockwork subtype. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level. Additionally, he treats his caster level as 1 higher when casting a spell that affects or targets only creatures of the clockwork subtype. At 8th level, he treats his caster level as 2 higher when casting such a spell.

This replaces the school powers granted by the wizard's arcane school.

Craft Construct: A clocksmith gains <a href="featdisplay2071.html?ItemName=Craft%20Construct">Craft Construct</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. He can create any construct, but he increases the cost required to create constructs without the clockwork subtype by 50%.

This replaces Scribe Scroll.

Familiar Tinkering (Ex): At 5th level, a clocksmith learns to improve upon his clockwork familiar. A clocksmith can grant his familiar 1 evolution point worth of <a href="_summonerevolutions.html">eidolon evolutions</a> for every 5 wizard levels he has, though he can't select any evolutions that require a specific base form. Each time the clocksmith gains a level, he can change his familiar's evolutions. These evolutions stack with those from the <a href="featdisplaya062.html?ItemName=Evolved%20Familiar">Evolved Familiar</a> feat.

This replaces the bonus feats gained at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels.
