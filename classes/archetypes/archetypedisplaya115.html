Cyber-soldiers replace fallible flesh with precisioncrafted machinery. Some seek to exceed the limitations of humanoid flesh, while others become cyber-soldiers through drastic repairs necessitated by horrific injuries. A cyber-soldier has the following class features.

Cybernetic Combat (Ex):  At 5th level, a cyber-soldier gains a  bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with implanted weapons, cybernetic arms, and melee or thrown weapons wielded with a cybernetic arm. Weapons wielded with two cybernetic arms receive double the bonus, except when such weapons are thrown. This damage bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels gained. This attack bonus does not stack with the attack bonus for weapon training. A cyber-soldier gains a slam attack for each cybernetic arm. These attacks deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for a Medium cyber-soldier and 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for a Small cybersoldier. This ability replaces weapon training 1.

Improved Implantation (Ex):  At 7th level, a cybersoldier can exceed the normal limitations on cybertech implantation. Her brain and body slots each accommodate one more piece of cybertech than normal. In addition, her limit on implantation points increases by 1/2 his cybersoldier level. She can allocate these points between his Intelligence and Constitution scores as she chooses. At 15th level, her body slot can accommodate two more pieces of cybertech than normal. This ability replaces armor training 2 and 4.

Resilience (Ex):  At 19th level, a cyber-soldier has a reservoir of 5 temporary hit points for each piece of implanted cybertech in his body. Lost temporary hit points are recovered at the rate of 10 points per hour. This ability replaces armor mastery.
