Oracles and sorcerers gain their magical powers through strange and mysterious ways, be they chosen by fate or blood. While most might be content with their strange powers, some oracles and sorcerers join the Pathfinders specifically to find out more about their mysteries and bloodlines and determine the genesis and history of their eldritch talents. These spellcasters are known among the Spells as seekers, after their obsession with researching ancient texts and obscure ruins for any clues they can find about their heritage and histories. A seeker has the following class features.

Tinkering (Ex): Seekers often look to ancient devices, old tomes, and strange magical items in order to learn more about their oracle mysteries or sorcerous bloodlines. As a result of this curiosity and thanks to an innate knack at deciphering the strange and weird, a seeker gains Disable Device as a class skill. In addition, at 1st level, a seeker adds half his oracle or sorcerer level on Perception checks made to locate traps and on all Disable Device skill checks (minimum +1). A seeker can use Disable Device to disarm magical traps. If the seeker also possesses levels in rogue or another class that provides the trapfinding ability, those levels stack with his oracle or sorcerer levels for determining his overall bonus on these skill checks. For an oracle, this ability replaces all of the bonus class skills he would otherwise normally gain from his mystery. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces his bonus Eschew Materials feat.

Seeker Lore (Ex): By 3rd level, a seeker has already learned much about his mystery or bloodline, and is more comfortable using the bonus spells gained by that mystery or bloodline. He gains a +4 bonus on all concentration checks, on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance, and on all Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks made on topics associated with his bonus spells. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 3rd level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 3rd level.

Seeker Magic (Su): At 15th level, a seeker becomes skilled at modifying his mystery or bloodline spells with metamagic. When a seeker applies a metamagic feat to any bonus spells granted by his mystery or his bloodline, he reduces the metamagic feat's spell level adjustment by 1. Thus, applying a Metamagic feat like Still Spell to a spell does not change its effective spell level at all, while applying Quicken Spell only increases the spell's effective spell level by 3 instead of by 4. This reduction to the spell level adjustment for Metamagic feats does not stack with similar reductions from other abilities. For an oracle, this ability replaces the revelation gained at 15th level. For a sorcerer, this ability replaces the bloodline power gained at 15th level.
