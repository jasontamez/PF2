Oozemorph

While most shifters are trained in druidic traditions that allow them to tap into animalistic powers, others look instead to the simplest forms of life for inspiration. Known as oozemorphs, these shifters focus on the ooze-a form of life as simple in construction as it is dangerous in combat. While some shifters consider the oozemorph to be unsettling or even vile, these shifters merely embrace a stranger form of life than most. They are not inherently evil, yet they are often misunderstood by druidic circles and these circles' shifter champions.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An oozemorph is proficient with all simple weapons and light armor.

This replaces a shifter's normal weapon and armor proficiencies.

Compression (Ex): An oozemorph gains compression as per the universal monster rule. This ability can be used regardless of the current form the oozemorph has taken.

Fluidic Body (Su): An oozemorph's base form is not that of her race but rather that of a protoplasmic blob that has the same volume and weight. An oozemorph treats her creature type as both ooze and her base creature type from her race for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as bane weapons and a ranger's favored enemy). In this form, the oozemorph is immune to critical hits and precision damage and can't be flanked. However, she has no magic item slots and she cannot benefit from armor; cast spells; hold objects; speak; or use any magic item that requires activation, is held, or is worn on the body.

An oozemorph reverts to this formless state whenever she is unconscious or in an area of antimagic. This is treated as a polymorph effect.

A number of times per day equal to half her level (minimum 1), an oozemorph can assume a humanoid form as a move action. This transformation is identical to alter self, except the oozemorph can maintain the form for a number of hours equal to her level. Each hour after this duration, the oozemorph must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or revert back to her fluidic body until she rests for at least 8 hours. This save DC increases by 1 for each additional hour spent maintaining the form.

At 8th level, the oozemorph can treat this ability as beast shape I, and at 15th level, she can treat this ability as beast shape II or giant shape I.

Ending this transformation at any time reverts the oozemorph back to her ooze form and renders her fatigued for a number of minutes equal to the number of hours she maintained the form.

This replaces chimeric form, greater chimeric form, wild shape, shifter aspect, and all improvements of shifter aspect.

Morphic Weaponry (Ex): An oozemorph can create a number of natural weapons to fight with from any portion of her body, regardless of her current form. At 1st level, as a move action, an oozemorph can form two primary natural attacks that each deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, chosen by the oozemorph when she forms them. An oozemorph can change the damage type of any number of her natural weapons as a swift action. An oozemorph gains one additional primary natural attack at 6th level and another at 15th level.

The total number of natural attacks an oozemorph has at any given time includes those gained via her current form. For example, an 8th-level oozemorph who has taken the form of a wolf with beast shape I has a bite attack as part of that form; she can create only two additional natural attacks via morphic weaponry, for a total of three attacks available to her at that level. If the oozemorph later reverts to a humanoid form with no natural weapons, she can instead create three morphic weapons.

This replaces shifter claws.

Ooze Empathy (Ex): An oozemorph gains the shifter's wild empathy class feature, but she can use it only to influence the attitude of oozes with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower. An oozemorph can use this ability on mindless oozes; when she does so, she imparts a modicum of intellect to the ooze to allow it to respond to her commands.

This alters wild empathy.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At 2nd level, an oozemorph gains DR 4/slashing while unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light nonmetal armor. This damage reduction increases by 2 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of DR 14/slashing at 20th level.

This replaces defensive instinct.

Clinging Ooze (Ex): At 4th level, when in her natural form, an oozemorph gains a climb speed of 10 feet.

This replaces woodland stride.



Nethys Note


The oozemorph archetype has had several of its abilities clarified in the <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1hj">official Paizo FAQ</a> and have been copied below:

Oozemorph Shifter: How does the oozemorph's fluidic body work? Can the oozemorph actually move at all in ooze form? Why does a supernatural ability still have an effect in an antimagic field?

Fluidic Body is essentially two effects in one. The first, which is a permanent part of your character once you become an oozemorph, is that your base form is now an ooze shape. Even if you lose fluidic body for some reason (antimagic field, violating your code of conduct, etc) your base form is still the amorphous oozelike form. The other half of the ability is a supernatural polymorph effect to transform into humanoid (and later bestial) forms.

Despite having an oozelike shape, an oozemorph's base form is not an ooze, though it does also count as an ooze for the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type. The oozelike form doesn't gain any abilities of the ooze creature type except as stated by the archetype itself. This form retains the base senses and land speed of the oozemorph's original race, as well as racial abilities like dwarfs' greed or gnomes' obsession that don't depend on shape, but it loses abilities dependent on form, including form-based speeds like strix's flight (and most other racial speeds beyond land speed), racial natural attacks like catfolks' claws, and other abilities like tieflings' prehensile tail. However, if the oozemorph possesses a racial ability denied her in her oozelike form and transforms into a member of her own race with fluidic body, she gains the full benefits of that racial ability for that duration, even if it isn't usually granted when using alter self (or the appropriate spell for a non-humanoid oozemorph). An oozemorph's compression, damage reduction, and morphic weaponry function in its oozelike form and any form it takes via fluidic body, though not in forms it takes via other polymorph effects.

These clarifications will be reflected in the next errata.


Oozemorph and Items: I know I don't have any item slots as an ooze, but what about items that take 24 hours to attune? Can I just never use those items?

An oozemorph can carry items floating in its mass that are considered to be attuned. When it turns into a humanoid form via fluidic body, it can equip any number of those items (even armor, which usually takes time to don), leaving the rest on the ground in its space. If it turns into a animal via fluidic form, the items meld into the new form and grant some passive benefits, as normal for polymorph effects
