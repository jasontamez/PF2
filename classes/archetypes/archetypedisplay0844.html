Bacchanal

Bacchanals are skalds who use ecstatic dancing and ribald songs to influence the primal instincts of listeners. To these skalds, the passionate frenzy of a celebration or feast shares many features with the violence of combat, and several of their talents blur the line between festival and battle in dramatic ways.

Fermented Fruit (Sp): A bacchanal adds goodberry to his list of 1st-level skald spells known. In addition, he can cast it as a spell-like ability once per day. When he casts goodberry as a spell or spell-like ability, the targeted berries ferment; this causes each berry to act as a serving of an alcoholic beverage. A creature that eats a fermented berry does not gain a meal's nourishment, but it is cured of 1 point of damage and becomes slightly foolhardy as if tipsy, gaining a +1 bonus on saves against fear effects for 1 minute after eating the berry.

This replaces Scribe Scroll.

Drunken Dancer (Su): At 2nd level, while maintaining a raging song, a bacchanal can consume a berry affected by goodberry, a potion, or a serving of alcohol as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A berry affected by goodberry or a potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink or a berry affected by goodberry via fermented fruit (see above) allows the skald to maintain his raging song that round without expending a round of raging song for the day (instead of the normal effects of the alcohol or fermented berry). For each alcoholic drink or fermented berry consumed while raging, the skald is nauseated for 1 round after his raging song ends. The internal fortitude rage power prevents this nauseated condition from occurring.

At 7th level, when the bacchanal consumes an alcoholic drink or fermented berry while maintaining his rage song, he can gain the benefits of cure light wounds or remove fear (for the duration of the raging song) at his caster level by spending 2 rounds of raging song. At 12th level, the bacchanal can gain the benefits of heroism (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner. At 17th level, he can gain the benefits of persistent vigor (for the duration of the raging song) in this manner.

This replaces versatile performance.

Raging Song (Su): A bacchanal gains access to the following raging songs.

Song of Urging (Su) At 3rd level, the bacchanal's raging song can wordlessly influence creatures of the wild. This raging song functions just like a Diplomacy check to make a simple request or an Intimidate check but can influence only animals. The bacchanal rolls 1d20 and adds his skald level and his Charisma modifier to determine the urging check's result. Bonuses and penalties that apply to wild empathy checks apply to these urging checks. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. The song can influence plants or magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 as well as drunken creatures of any Intelligence (even without sharing a language), but against these nonanimals, the bacchanal takes a -4 penalty on this check. The bacchanal must continue to perform the song for the entire time required for the check; otherwise, its effect is wasted, but only 1 round of raging song is expended regardless of how long the check takes.

This raging song replaces song of marching.

Maddening Dance (Su): At 10th level, the bacchanal's raging song can compel a creature within 30 feet to perform an ecstatic dance. Unless it succeeds at its Will save, the victim becomes confused, takes a -2 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saving throws, and loses the benefit of any shield it holds. The effect ends when the target can no longer hear the bacchanal from within 30 feet. As an immediate action, an ally of the bacchanal within 30 feet can dance along as a full-round action (taking all penalties except the confused condition for that round) to allow the bacchanal to target an additional creature. A creature that succeeds at the Will saving throw against this raging song is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a compulsion, emotion, enchantment, and mind-affecting effect.

This raging song replaces dirge of doom.

Rage Powers: The following rage powers complement the bacchanal archetype: animal fury, boasting taunt, fearless rage, fierce fortitude, increased damage reduction, internal fortitude, liquid courage, night vision, roaring drunk, and staggering drunk.
