Deep in darkness, the snare setter constructs his deadly
traps and brutal mechanisms to confound and destroy any
who try to invade his domain.

Trapper (Ex): At 1st level, a snare setter gains Learn Ranger
Trap (see page 24) as a bonus feat. In addition to the trap
granted by this feat, he learns how to construct the tripwire
trap for free. For the purposes of this feat, he's considered
a ranger of his snare setter level, and uses his Intelligence
in place of Wisdom to determine uses per day and the DC
of his ranger traps. Whenever the snare setter could learn
a new rogue trick, he may instead learn a new ranger trap.

This ability replaces sneak attack (but see below).

Trapsmithing (Ex): A snare setter gains a bonus on
Perception skill checks to detect traps and on Craft (traps)
checks equal to 1/2 his snare setter level. He can use Craft
(traps) in place of Disable Device to disarm traps, including
magical traps.

This ability replaces trapfinding.

Deadly Traps (Ex): At 3rd level, the snare setter's traps
deal an additional 1d6 points of damage on the first round
they're activated. This damage is of the same type the trap
normally deals. Traps that don't deal damage are unaffected
by this ability. This additional damage increases by 1d6
points every 4 levels beyond 3rd (7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th).

Sneak Attack (Su): At 5th level, the snare setter gains
sneak attack +1d6. This functions as the rogue ability of
the same name, but the damage increases by 1d6 every 4
levels after 5th (9th, 13th, and 17th).

Master Snare Setter (Ex): At 20th level, the snare setter
can attach one of a rogue's master strike effects to a trap
he creates. When the trap is triggered, the subject makes
an additional Fortitude save at the same DC as the trap
to avoid this effect. A snare setter can have only one trap
affected by this ability active at any time. He may remove
this ability from a trap at any range as a free action.

This ability replaces master strike.

Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement
the snare setter archetype: camouflage, cunning trigger,
fast stealth, sniper's eye.
