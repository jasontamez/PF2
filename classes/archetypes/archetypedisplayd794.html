An elementalist oracle shares an affinity with the elements and elemental creatures. She can communicate with elemental creatures and can eventually become an elemental herself. She sees perfection in manifestations of elemental fury in the natural world, be they the thunderous wrath of the storm, the churning waters of the ocean's tides or a flooding river, the terrain-shaping power of a landslide or earthquake, or the apocalyptic fury of a volcanic eruption.

Recommended Mysteries: Flame, stone, waves, wind.

Bonus Spells: Elemental touch (4th), protection from energy (6th), elemental body I (8th), summon monster V (elementals only; 10th), elemental body III (12th), elemental swarm (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells at these levels.

Revelations: An elementalist oracle must take the following revelations at the listed levels. Elemental Linguist (Su): At 1st level, you gain a bonus language of your choice from the following list: Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran. At 5th, 10th, and 15th levels, you gain another language chosen from this list.

Elemental Form (Su): At 11th level, you gain the air, earth, fire, or water subtype and an associated ability: <ul><li>Air: Fly speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability.</li> <li>Earth: Tremorsense with a range of 30 feet.</li> <li>Fire: Immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold.</li> <li>Water: Swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe underwater.</li></ul>

Elemental Revelation (Su): At 20th level, you fully harness the power of the elements. You can apply the Elemental Spell metamagic feat to spells you cast without increasing the level or casting time. You can choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire each time you use this ability. Whenever you score a critical hit with an attack that deals energy damage, you ignore the target's energy resistance (if any). If you score such a critical hit against a creature that has immunity to the energy type you are attacking with, the creature takes half damage from the attack.

This replaces final revelation.
