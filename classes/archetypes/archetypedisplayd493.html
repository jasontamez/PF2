While most alchemists use mutagens to boost their physical ability at the cost of mental ability, some use alchemy for the opposite purpose-to boost the power of the mind and memory. A mindchemist can reach incredible levels of mental acuity, but suffers lingering debilitating effects to his physique. A mindchemist has the following class features.

Cognatogen:  At 1st level, a mindchemist learns how to create a cognatogen, as per the cognatogen discovery. This ability replaces the mutagen class ability (a mindchemist cannot create mutagens unless he selects mutagen* as a discovery).

Perfect Recall:  At 2nd level, a mindchemist has honed his memory. When making a Knowledge check, he may add his Intelligence bonus on the check a second time. Thus, a mindchemist with 5 ranks in Knowledge (history) and a +2 Intelligence bonus has a total skill bonus of +9 (5 + 2 + 2) using this ability. The mindchemist can also use this ability when making an Intelligence check to remember something. This ability replaces poison use.

Bonus Feats:  A mindchemist may select <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Disable Device, Disguise, Heal, any Knowledge skill, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft)</a> in place of a discovery.

Languages:  A mindchemist may learn three languages in place of a discovery.

Discoveries:  The following discoveries complement the mindchemist archetype: grand cognatogen, greater cognatogen, infuse mutagen.
