Zen Archer

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 115</a>
Some monks seek to become one with another weapon entirely-the bow. The zen archer takes a weapon most other monks eschew and seeks perfection in the pull of a taut bowstring, the flex of a bow's limbs, and the flight of an arrow fired true.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  Zen archers are proficient with longbows, shortbows, composite longbows, and composite shortbows in addition to their normal weapon proficiencies.

Flurry of Blows (Ex):  Starting at 1st level, a zen archer can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action, but only when using a bow (even though it is a ranged weapon). He may not make a flurry of blows with his unarmed attacks or any other weapons. A zen archer does not apply his Strength bonus on damage rolls made with flurry of blows unless he is using a composite bow with a Strength rating. A zen archer's flurry of blows otherwise functions as normal for a monk of his level.

A zen archer cannot use <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot</a> or <a href="featdisplayf76c.html?ItemName=Manyshot">Manyshot</a> when making a flurry of blows with his bow.

Bonus Feats:  A zen archer's bonus feats must be taken from the following list: <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="featdisplayf9c9.html?ItemName=Deflect%20Arrows">Deflect Arrows</a>, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplayb19b.html?ItemName=Far%20Shot">Far Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a>, and <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot</a>. At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list: <a href="featdisplay2f2a.html?ItemName=Focused%20Shot">Focused Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplay5a28.html?ItemName=Improved%20Precise%20Shot">Improved Precise Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplayf76c.html?ItemName=Manyshot">Manyshot</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, and <a href="featdisplay9126.html?ItemName=Parting%20Shot">Parting Shot</a>. At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list: <a href="featdisplay11f4.html?ItemName=Improved%20Critical">Improved Critical</a>, <a href="featdisplay1503.html?ItemName=Pinpoint%20Targeting">Pinpoint Targeting</a>, <a href="featdisplay025f.html?ItemName=Shot%20on%20the%20Run">Shot on the Run</a>, and <a href="featdisplay6b40.html?ItemName=Snatch%20Arrows">Snatch Arrows</a>. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them. These feats replace the monk's normal bonus feats.

Perfect Strike (Ex):  At 1st level, a zen archer gains <a href="featdisplay3faa.html?ItemName=Perfect%20Strike">Perfect Strike</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A zen archer can use <a href="featdisplay3faa.html?ItemName=Perfect%20Strike">Perfect Strike</a> with any bow. At 10th level, the monk can roll his attack roll three times and take the highest result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the monk must choose one of his other two rolls to use as his confirmation roll. This ability replaces Stunning Fist.

Way of the Bow (Ex):  At 2nd level, a zen archer gains <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a> as a bonus feat with one type of bow. At 6th level, the monk gains <a href="featdisplay3469.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Specialization">Weapon Specialization</a> with the same weapon as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces evasion.

Zen Archery (Ex):  At 3rd level, a zen archer may use his Wisdom modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier on ranged attack rolls when using a bow. This ability replaces maneuver training.

Point Blank Master (Ex):  At 3rd level, a zen archer gains <a href="featdisplay85f5.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Master">Point-Blank Master</a> as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces still mind.

Ki Pool (Su):  At 4th level, in addition to the normal abilities of his ki pool, a zen archer may spend 1 point from his ki pool to increase the range increment for his bow by 50 feet for 1 round.

Ki Arrows (Su): At 5th level, a zen archer may spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to change the damage dice of arrows he shoots to that of his unarmed strikes. This lasts until the start of his next turn. For example, a Medium zen archer's short bow normally deals 1d6 damage; using this ability, his arrows deal 1d8 damage until the start of his next turn. This ability replaces purity of body.

Reflexive Shot (Ex): At 9th level, a zen archer can make attacks of opportunity with arrows from his bow. The monk still threatens squares he could reach with unarmed strikes, and can still only make one attack of opportunity per round (unless he has <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>). This ability replaces improved evasion.

Trick Shot (Su): At 11th level, a zen archer may hit targets that he might otherwise miss. By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, the zen archer can ignore concealment. By spending 2 points, he can ignore total concealment or cover. By spending 3 points, he can ignore total cover, even firing arrows around corners. The arrow must still be able to reach the target; a target inside a closed building with no open doors or windows cannot be attacked. These effects last for 1 round. This ability replaces diamond body.

Ki Focus Bow (Su): At 17th level, as long as he has at least 1 point of ki in his ki pool, a zen archer may treat arrows fired from his bow as if they were <a href="magicweaponsdisplay636a.html?ItemName=Ki%20Focus">ki focus</a> weapons, allowing him to use his special ki attacks as if his arrows were unarmed attacks. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.
