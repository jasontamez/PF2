A thought thief will happily rip ideas from their victim's head and their gold from their purse.

Requirements: To qualify to become a thought thief, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.
Skills: Disable Device 4 ranks, Escape Artist 4 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks.
Spells: Ability to cast <a href="spelldisplayf4ed.html?ItemName=mage%20hand">mage hand</a> and at least one psychic spell of 2nd level or higher.
Special: Sneak attack +2d6.

This alters requirements.

Mental Assault (Su): At 3rd level, once per day as a standard action, a thought thief can pinpoint a target's trauma and exploit weakness with a deluge of psychic power. This is a melee touch attack that deals damage equal to her sneak attack damage and grants the thought thief control of the target as <a href="spelldisplay5c39.html?ItemName=dominate%20person">dominate person</a> for a number of rounds equal to her thought thief level. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + the thought thief's level + her Charisma modifier) negates the dominate effect. A thought thief can only use this ability against a target that is susceptible to her sneak attack, such as a target she is flanking. This attack has no effect on creatures without an intelligence score. At 7th level, a thought thief can use this ability twice per day.

This replaces impromptu sneak attack.

Unseen Compulsion: At 5th level a thought thief can hide the effects of any spell she casts with the mind-affecting and compulsion spell descriptors. Creatures that observe her casting such a spell can attempt a Sense Motive check to notice the spell (DC = 15 + the thought thief's ranks in Bluff + the thought thief's Charisma modifier). Creatures that fail their check are unaware of any effects of the thought thief's spell.

This replaces tricky spells.
