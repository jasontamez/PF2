Familiars can be skilled spies, and infiltrators are the very best of their kind at the subtle art of espionage.

Infiltrator Skills: An infiltrator treats Bluff and Disguise as class skills.

Alertness (Ex): An infiltrator gains Alertness as a bonus feat rather than providing that feat to its master.

This alters alertness.

Share Spells (Ex): An infiltrator can share only divination spells that have a target of "you" via this ability.

This alters share spells.

Uncanny Stealth (Ex): An infiltrator gains uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge, treating its master's level as its effective rogue level.

This replaces improved evasion.

Scry on Familiar (Sp): At 7th level, an infiltrator's master can scry on it for up to 1 minute per level per day. The duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

This replaces speak with animals of its kind.

Telepathic Bond (Sp): At 11th level, an infiltrator gains a permanent telepathic bond with its master. This bond has no range limit as long as the familiar and its master are on the same plane.

This replaces spell resistance.
