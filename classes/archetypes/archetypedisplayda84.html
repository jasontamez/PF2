The steel-breaker studies destruction and practices it as an art form. She knows every defense has a breaking point, and can shatter those defenses with carefully planned strikes.

Class Skills:  The steel-breaker gains Knowledge (engineering) as a class skill, and does not gain Knowledge (dungeoneering) as a class skill.

Exploit Weakness (Ex):  At 5th level, as a swift action a steel-breaker can observe a creature or object to find its weak point by succeeding at a Wisdom check, adding her brawler level against a DC of 10  the object's hardness or the target's CR. If it succeeds, the steel-breaker gains a  bonus on attack rolls until the end of her turn, and any attacks she makes until the end of her turn ignore the creature or object's DR or hardness.

A steel-breaker can instead use this ability as a swift action to analyze the movements and expressions of one creature within 30 feet, granting a bonus on Sense Motive checks and Reflex saving throws, as well as a dodge bonus to AC against that opponent equal to 1/2 her brawler level until the start of her next turn. This ability replaces brawler's strike.

Sunder Training (Ex):  At 3rd level, a steel-breaker receives additional training in sunder combat maneuvers. She gains a  bonus when attempting a sunder combat maneuver checks and a  bonus to her CMD when defending against this maneuver. At 7th level, these bonuses increase by 1, and she gains a  bonus on disarm combat maneuver checks and a  bonus to her CMD when defending against a disarm maneuver. At 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, all of these bonuses increase by 1. This ability alters maneuver training.
