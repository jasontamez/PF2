Toxiticians forgo the mesmerist's stare, instead combining their psychic power with their alchemical knowledge to craft injections that torment their foes and bolster themselves and their allies.

Deft Fingers (Ex):  A toxitician adds 1/2 his class level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Sleight of Hands checks. This ability replaces consummate liar.

Injections (Su):  At 1st level, the toxitician uses his skill with alchemy and his own psychic powers to create injections. The toxitician can create a number of injections per day equal to his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier. It takes 1 hour to create the injections. An injection is inert until the toxitician attempts to use it, taking a swift action to infuse it with his psychic power to activate it.

Using an injection requires taking a standard action to attempt a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target of an injection takes a -2 penalty on its Will saving throws for a number of minutes equal to 1/2 the toxitican's class level (minimum 1). The penalty becomes -3 at 8th level. The toxitician can simultaneously attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to inject the target surreptitiously. If the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand, the target can attempt a Perception check to detect the attempt, opposed by the Sleight of Hand check result, but detecting the attempt doesn't prevent the creature from being injected. Whenever the toxitician uses Sleight of Hand to administer one of his injections, he can implant it rather than injecting it and then trigger the effect of the injection at a later time. At any point before he regains his injections, the toxitician can trigger an implanted injection as a free action. The toxitician must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per mesmerist level) of the target of the implanted injection.

If either the melee touch attack or the Sleight of Hand check (if attempted) fails, the injection isn't delivered but can still be used again-once activated, it remains potent for 1 day. An injection that hasn't been administered becomes inert if it leaves the toxitician's possession, reactivating as soon as it returns to his keeping.

The penalties from multiple injections don't stack, nor do the penalties from injections stack with penalties from mesmerist stares or witches' evil eye hexes. Injections are mind-affecting effects.

This ability replaces hypnotic stare.

Painful Injection (Su):  The toxitician's injection causes intense pain. This increases the damage the subject takes in the same way as the mesmerist's painful stare class feature. This extra damage is dealt automatically, without being triggered by the toxitician, but doesn't increase when the toxitician damages the target and can still be dealt only once per round. This ability replaces painful stare.

Injection Improvement (Su):  At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a toxitician can select one improvement to add to his injections. The toxitician can't choose the same improvement more than once. The toxitician doesn't have to select the improvements when he prepares his injections at the start of the day; the choice is made as part of the swift action to activate the injection. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to resist an injection with an improvement added to it. The DC is 10 + 1/2 the toxitician's class level + the toxitician's Charisma modifier. On a successful save, the target still takes the penalty on its Will saving throws, but not the effects of the improvement. A toxitician can, as a free action, sacrifice one use of his injections to increase the DC of another injection by 2.

Ability Decrease: The target takes a -2 penalty to one ability score of the toxitician's choosing. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4.

Excruciating: The extra damage from painful injection increases by an amount equal to 2 points + 1 point per 3 mesmerist levels the toxitician possesses.

Fortitude Decrease: The target's immune system weakens, imposing a -2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4.

Natural Armor Decrease: The target's skin becomes looser, decreasing its natural armor (if any) by 2. At 11th level, its natural armor bonus instead decreases by 4.

Reflex Decrease: The target's body becomes stiffer, imposing a -2 penalty on the target's Reflex saving throws. At 11th level, the penalty becomes -4.

Slow: The target's actions become sluggish, reducing its base movement by 10 feet and imposing a -1 penalty on attack rolls. At 11th level, the penalty on attack rolls becomes -2.

This ability replaces bold stare.

Treatment Vials (Su):  At 3rd level, a toxitician can create treatment vials when he creates his injections for the day; creating each treatment vial expends one use of touch treatment. A treatment vial has the same benefit as his touch treatment, but anyone can administer it as a standard action. A vial can remove any condition the toxitician is able to remove at his mesmerist level, but can't be used for a break enchantment effect. A treatment vial becomes inert after 24 hours. This ability alters touch treatment.

Improved Injections (Su):  At 11th level, the toxitician can add two different improvements to an injection. The injection still requires only one save. This ability replaces glib lie.
