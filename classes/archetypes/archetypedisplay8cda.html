Whether the result of a partially successful attempt at revival, a strange blight, or repeated exposure to undead, deathtouched companions are living animals with a trace of the undead, somewhat like dhampirs.

Deathtouched Skills: Deathtouched companions treat Intimidate as a class skill.

Not Quite Animal: The DC to use Handle Animal on a deathtouched companion is 5 higher, as if it were a nonanimal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. It doesn't count as an animal for the purpose of an undead's unnatural aura.

Dead Sight (Ex): A deathtouched companion gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet.

This replaces share spells.

Negative Energy Affinity (Ex): Though a living creature, a deathtouched companion reacts to positive and negative energy as if it were undead-positive energy harms it, while negative energy heals it.

One Foot in the Grave (Ex): At 6th level, a deathtouched companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Fortitude saves against effects that could not normally affect objects or undead, and it takes only half damage from bleed effects. However, it can be affected by attacks that specifically target undead, such as halt undead.

This replaces devotion.
