Masters of mind tricks and deception, these divine assassins track down and kill anyone who has forbidden knowledge about their faiths.

Bound by Secrecy (Ex):  A reaper of secrets must choose Norgorber as her deity. If she ever changes her deity, she loses this archetype and becomes a normal inquisitor.

Deceitful Lore (Ex):  At 1st level, a reaper of secrets adds her Wisdom modifier on Bluff and Disguise skill checks in addition to her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces monster lore.

Soul-Piercing Gaze (Su):  At 1st level, as a swift action, a reaper of secrets can focus on a single creature she can see. She then gains an insight bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks against that creature equal to 1/2 her level (minimum +1). The effect ends if she focuses on a new target. This ability replaces stern gaze.

Mind-Game Tactics (Su):  At 3rd level, a reaper of secrets can read other creatures so well she can use their reactions to gain a tactical advantage. She treats any creature targeted by her soul-piercing gaze as if it were her ally and possessed the same teamwork feats as she does for the purposes of positioning and threatening when she determines whether she receives a benefit from her teamwork feats. She cannot use this ability to benefit from any teamwork feats that require particular actions from allies, such as Swap Places.

For example, a reaper of secrets with the Precise Strike feat gains the bonus from that feat if she and the target of her soul-piercing gaze occupy flanking positions relative to the creature she attacks.

This ability replaces solo tactics.
