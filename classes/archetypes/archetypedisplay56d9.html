Hag-Riven

All changelings have the potential to transform into hags, but the process is a slow one, requiring several nights to complete. When left incomplete-by virtue of a wily changeling's escape or her mother's death-the creature is scarred and saturated in arcane power. Though she remains in possession of her own faculties, the seeds of hag hatred sprout within her. These hag-riven wield powerful magic interlaced with more powerful emotions.

The painful rituals that create a hag-riven can work for any creatures tenacious enough to endure them, and the art has sprung up as a defense against the devastating power of hags in various remote communities.

Arcane Influence:  A hag-riven bloodrager does not gain proficiency with martial weapons and must choose from one of the following bloodrager bloodlines: <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplayaee0.html?ItemName=Arcane">arcane</a>, <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplay4903.html?ItemName=Destined">destined</a>, <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplay04c4.html?ItemName=Elemental">elemental</a>, <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplaycdfa.html?ItemName=Fey">fey</a>, or <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplay0733.html?ItemName=Hag">hag</a>.

This alters the bloodrager's weapon and armor proficiencies.

Claws of the Hag (Ex):  A hag-riven grows a pair of vicious claws that are treated as natural weapons. These claws are primary attacks and deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 for a Small creature) plus the hag-riven's Strength modifier. At 2nd level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 5th level, the damage increases to 1d6 points (1d4 for a Small creature). At 13th level, the hag-riven's claws threaten a critical hit on a natural roll of 19-20. At 16th level, the damage increases again to 1d8 points (1d6 for a Small creature).

This replaces fast movement and uncanny dodge.

Sorcerous Claws (Su):
At 5th level, a hag-riven can expend one of her daily spell slots as a swift action to grant her claws an enhancement bonus equal to the level of the spell slot sacrificed. This bonus lasts for 1 minute and stacks with existing enhancement bonuses (such as those provided by <a href="spelldisplay8525.html?ItemName=magic%20fang">magic fang</a> or magic items) to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.

Beginning at 7th level, the hag-riven can also expend some or all of the bonus provided by her sorcerous claws to add any of the following weapon properties to her claws for 1 minute: <a href="magicweaponsdisplay0b68.html?ItemName=Flaming">flaming</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay24ed.html?ItemName=Flaming%20Burst">flaming burst</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplayc7e5.html?ItemName=Frost">frost</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay02b9.html?ItemName=Icy%20Burst">icy burst</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7362.html?ItemName=Keen">keen</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay6727.html?ItemName=Nullifying">nullifying</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay380f.html?ItemName=Seaborn">seaborne</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7172.html?ItemName=Spellstealing">spellstealing</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplayf62f.html?ItemName=Shock">shock</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay4179.html?ItemName=Shocking%20Burst">shocking burst</a>, or <a href="magicweaponsdisplay05ea.html?ItemName=Wounding">wounding</a>. Her claws must have a minimum enhancement bonus of +1 before any special abilities can be added.

This replaces improved uncanny dodge.

Scarred Hide (Ex):  At 7th level, a hag-riven's scarred flesh becomes thick and leathery. She gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC. At 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, this bonus increases by 1.

Hexing Claws (Su):  At 10th level, a hag-riven gains <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a> as a bonus feat, but she can apply its benefits only to her claw attacks. Each morning, she can select a single feat with <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a> as a prerequisite and apply its benefits to her claw attacks. She must meet all other prerequisites for any feat she wishes to apply with this ability.

This replaces damage reduction.
