Divine champions are unswervingly devoted to their causes, and specialize in bringing battle to the enemies of their faiths. They are similar to divine paragons in many ways, but tend to focus more on their deity's combat prowess rather than seeking to become a physical manifestation of the deity's will.

Devotion: A divine champion's power comes from his close connection to his deity. He must worship a deity, and must maintain the same alignment as that deity.

Obedient Champion: At 3rd level, the divine champion gains Deific ObedienceISG as a bonus feat, even if he doesn't meet the feat's prerequisites. When a divine champion gains boons from this feat, he gains the appropriate sentinel boon offered by his deity, rather than gaining the exalted boon.

This replaces the bonus feat gained at 3rd level.

Know the Infidel (Ex): At 6th level, the divine champion becomes an expert at combating enemies of his faith. He must choose a deity whose alignment is opposed to his own deity's alignment in at least one way (good versus evil or law versus chaos); preferably, he should choose a deity whose alignment diametrically opposes that of his own deity. If the divine champion worships a deity whose alignment is neutral, he must instead select a deity whose alignment is chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good. The choice of this enemy deity is subject to GM approval. At the GM's discretion, the divine champion may be allowed to choose a philosophy or religious organization that's not affiliated with a deity, such as the Green Faith, the Pure Legion, or the Whispering Way, but only if that philosophy or religious organization is an enemy of the divine champion's deity. The divine champion gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against followers of the enemy faith, as well as a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls made against them. Additionally, he can attempt Knowledge skill checks relating to the deity and its church untrained, even if the DC is higher than 10.

Every 6 warpriest levels thereafter (12th and 18th level), the divine champion can select an additional deity to oppose. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against the followers of any one deity he selected previously (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by +2.

This replaces the bonus feats gained at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.

Fervent Boon (Sp): Beginning at 9th level, a divine champion can call upon his deity for minor boons. By expending one or more uses of his fervor ability, he can cast one of the spell-like abilities included in his deity's first sentinel boon. By expending one use of fervor, he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants three uses of per day; by expending two uses of fervor he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants twice per day; and by expending three uses of fervor, he can cast the spell-like ability that the boon normally grants once per day. These uses don't count against any uses granted by the boon.

This replaces the bonus feat gained at 9th level.
