Yojimbo are highly trained bodyguards favored by the nobles and warlords of distant Minkai. Yojimbo who follow the order of the warrior loyally guard a single master, while ronin serve whoever can pay for their protection. Yojimbo often accompany visitors to the Inner Sea region from Tian Xia; a few have chosen to stay, and some have even passed on their training to bodyguards of this region.
