Iron Tyrant

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9jbh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Armor-Masters-Handbook">Armor Master's Handbook pg. 4</a>
Covered from head to toe in blackened armor decorated with grotesque shapes and bristling with spikes, iron tyrants make an unmistakable impression on the battlefield. These antipaladins' armor is an outward symbol of their inner power, and they are rarely seen without it. Iron tyrants seek the strength to rule over domains as unfettered despots, and depend on their armor as protection against those they have not yet cowed.

Most iron tyrants are orcs or half-orcs who worship the orc deities <a href="deitydisplay683f.html?ItemName=Lanishra">Lanishra (god of slavery, subjugation, and tyranny)</a> or <a href="deitydisplay73b1.html?ItemName=Varg">Varg (god of iron, siege weapons, and warfare)</a>. Though rarer, some iron tyrants belong to other races and worship <a href="deitydisplay7734.html?ItemName=Urazra">Urazra (giant god of battle, brutality, and strength)</a> or demon lords such as <a href="deitydisplayfaec.html?ItemName=Aldinach">Aldinach (She of the Six Venoms)</a>, <a href="deitydisplay2e56.html?ItemName=Angazhan">Angazhan (the Ravenous King)</a>, or <a href="deitydisplayd17d.html?ItemName=Izyagna">Izyagna (She of the Sevenfold Swarm)</a>.

Iron Fist (Ex): At 2nd level, an iron tyrant gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. In addition, whenever the iron tyrant makes a successful attack with a gauntlet, spiked gauntlet, or armor spikes, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type, as per the <a href="classdisplay7c32.html?ItemName=Warpriest">warpriest's sacred weapon ability</a>.

This ability replaces touch of corruption.

Bonus Feats: At 3rd level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, an iron tyrant gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. This feat must be a <a href="feats3d6e.html?Category=Combat">combat feat</a> that relates to the iron tyrant's armor or shield, such as <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, or one of the <a href="feats2efe.html?Category=Armor%20Mastery">armor mastery feats</a>.

This ability replaces cruelty.

Unstoppable (Ex): At 4th level, when wearing heavy armor, an iron tyrant is not slowed by terrain that halves movement (such as dense rubble, light undergrowth, and shallow bogs). Terrain that has been magically manipulated to impede motion or terrain that reduces movement by more than half still affects him.

This ability replaces channel negative energy.

Fiendish Bond (Su): At 5th level, instead of forming a fiendish bond with his weapon or a servant, an iron tyrant can form a bond with his armor. As a standard action, an iron tyrant can enhance his armor by calling upon a fiendish spirit's aid. This bond lasts for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the armor to shed unholy light like a torch. At 5th level, the spirit grants the armor a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 3 antipaladin levels beyond 5th, the armor gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses stack with existing armor enhancement bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following armor special abilities: <a href="magicarmordisplay022e.html?ItemName=Dastard">dastard</a>, <a href="magicarmordisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a>, <a href="magicarmordisplay7af0.html?ItemName=Fortification%20(light)">fortification (heavy, light, or medium)</a>, <a href="magicarmordisplaya65a.html?ItemName=Invulnerability">invulnerability</a>, <a href="magicarmordisplay3a8d.html?ItemName=Spell%20Resistance%20(13)">spell resistance (13, 15, 17, or 19)</a>. Adding these special abilities consumes an amount of bonus equal to the special ability's base price modifier. In addition, the iron tyrant can grant his armor the <a href="magicarmordisplayfd9b.html?ItemName=Unrighteous">unrighteous</a> special ability at the cost of a +4 bonus. These special abilities are added to any special abilities the armor already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the armor is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other special abilities can be added. The bonus and special abilities granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the armor is worn by anyone other than the iron tyrant, but it resumes giving bonuses if the iron tyrant dons the armor again. An iron tyrant can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every 4 levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.

If a suit of bonded armor with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the iron tyrant loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the iron tyrant takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls.

This ability replaces fiendish boon.
