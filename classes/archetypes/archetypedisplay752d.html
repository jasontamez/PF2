Esoterics are drawn to the mysticism of the occult and spend their lives delving into forgotten texts and forbidden tomes. Each esoteric learns to inscribe his spells on his flesh in a complex series of occult symbols and arcane equations.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  An esoteric is proficient with simple weapons only. This alters the magus's weapon and armor proficiency.

Diminished Spellcasting:  An esoteric has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level. This ability alters the magus's spellcasting.

Arcane Pool (Su):  At 1st level, an esoteric can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use these bonuses to add any of the following weapon special abilities to his weapons or unarmed strikes: defending, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, impact, shock, shocking burst, speed, or thundering.

This ability alters arcane pool.

Unarmed Strike:  At 1st level, an esoteric gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He also treats his magus levels as monk levels when determining the amount of damage he deals with his unarmed strikes.

Unarmed Spellstrike (Su):  At 1st level, an esoteric gains the magus spellstrike class feature. However, an esoteric can deliver spells with spellstrike only with his unarmed strikes. This ability alters spellstrike.

Ki Arcana (Su):  At 4th level, an esoteric's arcane pool is also considered a ki pool for the purposes of meeting feat and ability requirements. Points from an esoteric's arcane pool can be used for abilities that normally require ki. If an esoteric gains a ki pool, he can use points from his arcane pool and ki pool interchangeably (though not special points such as drunken ki). This ability replaces spell recall.

Tattooed Spell (Sp):  At 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter, an esoteric can permanently tattoo one spell from his magus spellbook onto his body; the first tattooed spell must be of 2nd level or lower, the second must be of 4th level or lower, and the last can be of any level. The spell that is tattooed must not have an expensive material component or a focus. The esoteric can prepare any tattooed spell without needing his spellbook. Additionally, he can cast each of his tattooed spells as a spell-like ability once per day. When the esoteric uses these spell-like abilities, the tattoo associated with the spell-like ability glows as light for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level. This ability replaces bonus feats.

AC Bonus (Ex):  At 7th level when an esoteric wears light or no armor, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 13th level. He loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, or while wearing medium or heavy armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load. This ability replaces medium armor and heavy armor.

Improved Tattooed Spell (Sp):  At 11th level, an esoteric can use each of his spell-like abilities from tattooed spell one additional time per day. This ability replaces improved spell recall.
