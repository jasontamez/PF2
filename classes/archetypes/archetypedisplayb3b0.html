Words can harm, but they also heal. The songhealer brings peace and surcease of pain, calming wild emotions and providing a balm for the wounded body.

Enhance Healing (Su):  A number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier, a songhealer can cause any healing effect from a spell completion or spell trigger item to function at a caster level equal to his class level. This ability replaces versatile performance.

Bardic Performance:  A songhealer gains the following type of bardic performance.

Healing Performance (Su): A bard of 14th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> on a living target (or <a href="spelldisplay7e6c.html?ItemName=harm">harm</a> on an undead target), using the bard's level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 5 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. The healing performance relies on audible and visual components. This ability replaces frightening tune.

Funereal Ballad (Su): A bard of 20th level or higher can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to <a href="spelldisplayd65d.html?ItemName=resurrection">resurrection</a> on a dead creature, using the bard's level as the caster level. Using this ability requires 20 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be within 10 feet of the bard for the entire performance. Funereal ballad relies on audible and visual components. This ability replaces deadly performance.
