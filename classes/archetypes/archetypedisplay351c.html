Black Powder Vaulter

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 10</a>
While firearms were designed to allow combatants to fight their foes from a distance, some gunslingers like to get into the thick of the battle, maneuvering among the fray to find the most advantageous positions from which to kill their enemies. The daredevil fighting style of the black powder vaulter has arisen simultaneously in two places-among Mana Wastes gunslingers inspired by the graceful fighting styles of Mwangi tribes, and among pirates from Tian Xia and the Shackles who encountered and inspired one another.

Deeds: A black powder vaulter gains the following deeds.

Mobile Reload (Ex): If a black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a firearm as part of a move action to move, provided that the action to reload that firearm with that type of ammunition would normally take only a move action or swift action. At 3rd level, she can use this deed while also using the shot on the run deed.

This deed replaces the deadeye deed.

Daring Vault (Ex): A black powder vaulter can spend 1 grit point as a swift action to increase her land speed by 20 feet (gaining the appropriate bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump) until the end of her turn. If the black powder vaulter jumps while affected by this deed, she can make a second jump while midair if she is adjacent to a wall, column, or other solid, permanent structure. The second jump counts as having a running start even if the direction is different from the first jump.

This deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.

Shot on the Run (Ex): At 3rd level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefits of the <a href="featdisplay025f.html?ItemName=Shot%20on%20the%20Run">Shot on the Run</a> feat. She gains this benefit only when making an attack with a firearm with which she is proficient. At 7th level, she can use the targeting deed as part of the same full-round action as using <a href="featdisplay025f.html?ItemName=Shot%20on%20the%20Run">Shot on the Run</a>.

This deed replaces the gunslinger initiative deed.

Art of the Gun (Ex): At 7th level, if the black powder vaulter has at least 1 grit point, she doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when attacking with a firearm or reloading a firearm. Additionally, whenever she is wielding a firearm, she counts as threatening an area around her as though she were wielding a melee weapon. If an opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from her, she can use the pistol-whip deed as her attack of opportunity, spending 1 grit point as normal. Alternatively, if her firearm is loaded, she can spend 1 grit point to fire her gun as her attack of opportunity.

This deed replaces the startling shot deed.

Dual Shot on the Run (Ex): At 11th level, the black powder vaulter can make two attacks with firearms while using the shot on the run deed.

This deed replaces the expert loading deed.
