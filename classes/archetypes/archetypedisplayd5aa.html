A conspirator uses his knowledge of investigations to make sure he avoids any investigations that his rivals perform, carefully plotting acts of intrigue behind closed doors. Paranoid to a fault, a conspirator always seems to know when someone else is watching him, and he takes numerous precautions to prevent anyone from observing his most illict actions.

Underhanded (Ex): Conspirators find their skill sets firmly aligned with the goals of the criminal underworld. At 1st level, a conspirator can use inspiration on any Bluff, Disable Device, Disguise, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand check without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, instead of on any Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft check. He can later choose to trade an investigator talent for the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge, Linguistics, and Spellcraft check without expending a use of inspirtation, provided he is trained in the skill. A conspirator adds half his investigator level (minimum 1) on Bluff checks to appear innocent and on Disguise checks.

This ability replaces trapfinding and alters inspiration.

Watcher Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, a conspirator is able to sense when someone else is watching him. He gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors, prying eyes, and other magical effects used to watch him, as well as on Perception checks to act on the surprise round. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 investigator levels thereafter.

Additionally, at 7th level, if a scrying sensor is invisible, the invisibility does not increase the DC of the conspirator's Perception check to notice it, regardless of whether or not he is using an ability that allows him to see invisible things. The DC for his Perception check is equal to 20 + the spell's level (with no +20 increase to the Perception DC for a moving invisible sensor or no +40 increase for an immobile invisible sensor).

This ability replaces trap sense and the investigator talent gained at 7th level.
