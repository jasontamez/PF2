Wild Effigy

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01vam">Construct Handbook pg. 15</a>
A wild effigy still takes on the shapes of natural animals, but rather than transforming her body into flesh and muscle, she transforms into constructed effigies of her chosen aspects.

Armor Plating (Su): A wild effigy's animal aspects are made out of carved, living rock. When a wild effigy is shifted into one of her minor or major aspects, she gains a +1 enhancement bonus to natural armor and gains DR adamantine equal to half her shifter level (minimum 1). The enhancement increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. At 6th level, these bonuses also apply when the wild effigy is transformed into one of her aspects using wild shape.

This replaces wild empathy, track, woodland stride, and trackless step.

Heart of Earth (Su): At 4th level, a wild effigy's stone aspects no longer require even the semblance of flesh and blood to function. When a wild effigy is shifted into a minor or major aspect, or is transformed into one of her aspects using wild shape, she adds her shifter level on checks to stabilize at negative hit points and gains a 25% chance to ignore a critical hit or precision damage. This does not stack with the <a href="magicarmordisplay7af0.html?ItemName=Fortification%20(light)">fortification armor property</a> or similar effects.

At 9th level, this chance increases to 50% and she becomes immune to petrification.

At 15th level, this chance increases to 75% and she becomes immune to bleed and blood drain effects.

This replaces defensive instinct.

Stoneclaw Strike (Su): At 6th level, a wild effigy can sacrifice minutes from her aspects' minor forms to turn her claws into adamantine. By expending a 1-minute increment of her shifter's minor aspect ability as a swift action, she can grant her shifter's claws the ability to ignore an amount of DR or hardness equal to her shifter level for 1 minute. The wild effigy can use this ability 3 times per day.
