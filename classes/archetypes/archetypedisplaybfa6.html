Sly and mischievous like the Lantern King himself, fey pranksters learn supernatural tricks that can cause their victims to suffer mishaps and accidents.

Mischievous Talent (Ex): A fey prankster adds half her class level (minimum 1) on Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skill checks, and can attempt Sleight of Hand checks untrained.

This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

Bardic Performance: A fey prankster gains the following types of bardic performance.

Song of Clumsiness (Su): A fey prankster can use this performance to cause enemies within 30 feet that can hear her to suffer seemingly random mishaps. Any enemy in this area that draws a weapon or retrieves an item from a backpack or similar container immediately drops it, and falls prone the first time it enters a square of difficult terrain during its turn. A creature can negate a specific effect with a successful Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half the fey prankster's bard level + her Charisma modifier), but an enemy must attempt a separate save for each potential effect during the song of clumsiness (for example, if it draws multiple weapons). Song of clumsiness is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability that relies on audible components.

This ability replaces countersong.

Incite Unreliability (Su): A fey prankster can use her performance to manipulate a single target into fighting erratically or haphazardly, as though affected by <a href="spelldisplaye11f.html?ItemName=confusion,%20lesser">lesser confusion</a>. To be affected, the target must be within 30 feet and able to hear the fey prankster's performance. The effect persists for as long as the target can hear the performance. A target that succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the fey prankster's bard level + her Charisma modifier) negates the effect and becomes immune to incite unreliability from the same fey prankster for 24 hours. Incite unreliability is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability that relies on audible components.

This ability replaces inspire courage.

Embarrassing Satire (Su): At 8th level, a fey prankster's powerful satire raises painful blisters and ugly boils on the face of her target. The fey prankster selects one target within 30 feet to become sickened from the uncomfortable facial boils. The sickened effect continues for as long as the target is within 30 feet and the fey prankster continues the performance, though the boils remain for 1 day afterward. Embarrassing satire is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that relies on audible components.

This ability replaces dirge of doom.

Dirty Trickster (Ex): At 2nd level, a fey prankster gains <a href="featdisplay9292.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirty%20Trick">Improved Dirty Trick</a> as a bonus feat and counts as having <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a> for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of feats that have <a href="spelldisplay9292.html?ItemName=Improved%20Dirty%20Trick">Improved Dirty Trick</a> as a prerequisite.

This ability replaces well-versed.

Master of Mischief (Ex): At 5th level, a fey prankster can take 10 on a Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth skill check (if she has ranks in that skill), even if distracted or endangered. In addition, once per day, the fey prankster can take 20 on one these skill checks (if she has ranks in that skill). She can use this ability one additional time per day for every 6 bard levels she has beyond 5th, to a maximum of three times per day at 17th level.

This ability replaces lore master.
