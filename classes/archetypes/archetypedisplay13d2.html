By tapping into the world's natural music, specialized bards known as filidhs are able to see not only the tapestry of life but divine portents of the future from the rhythm of all life's song.

Armor and Weapon Proficiency:  A filidh is proficient with light armor and is prohibited from wearing metal armor. A filidh can wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell. Filidhs are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but can use only those made of wood.

A filidh who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast bard spells or use any of his supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

This alters a bard's normal armor and weapon proficiencies.

Natural Magic:  A filidh casts spells as a bard, but the spells are divine, not arcane, and therefore not subject to arcane spell failure. A filidh must use a holy symbol or a musical instrument as a divine focus when a spell includes such a component. He still uses the bard spell list.

This alters the bard's spellcasting.

Nature's Song:  Filidhs can hear the resonant song generated by all living creatures-a primal music that stretches back to the beginning of time and ahead to the unwritten future. By tapping into this cosmic melody, a filidh can steal glimpses of the future. Once per day per level, a filidh can sacrifice a spell slot as a swift action to gain an additional number of rounds of bardic performance for that day equal to the spell's level.

In addition, a filidh gains the following types of bardic performances.

Echoes of Nature's Song (Su): A filidh can use his bardic performance to imbue his allies with subconscious knowledge of their own futures, improving their reflexes and ability to avoid danger. An affected ally receives a +1 insight bonus on Reflex saving throws and to AC. At 5th level and every 6 bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. This performance is a mind-affecting ability and relies on audible components.

This performance replaces inspire courage.

Divinatory Song (Sp): At 6th level, a filidh can use his performance to create an effect equivalent to <a href="spelldisplaya551.html?ItemName=divination">divination</a>, using the filidh's level as the caster level. The filidh and all allies who can hear his performance receive the information provided by the divination as flashes of inspiration and knowledge. Divinatory song takes 10 minutes and uses 6 rounds of bardic performance. Divinatory song relies on audible components.

This performance replaces suggestion.

Voices of Life (Su): At 8th level, a filidh can grant himself and all allies who can hear his performance the ability to speak with animals and plants as if affected by <a href="spelldisplay8821.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20animals">speak with animals</a> and <a href="spelldisplay3ee7.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20plants">speak with plants</a> so long as he maintains this performance.

This performance replaces dirge of doom.

Unity of Life (Su): At 15th level, a filidh can use his performance to interlink the life force of two allies who can hear his performance as though they were affected by <a href="spelldisplay2215.html?ItemName=shield%20other">shield other</a>, using the filidh's bard level as his caster level. The filidh designates which ally is the warded target and which ally receives half the warded creature's damage. The filidh can switch the targets of this ability (and the effect of the performance the targets receive) as a free action once per round at the start of each turn that he maintains the performance.

This performance replaces inspire heroics.

Song of the Cycle (Su): At 20th level, a filidh can grant awe-inspiring glimpses into the future with his magic. All allies who can see and hear the filidh are affected as though by the personal version of <a href="spelldisplay64da.html?ItemName=foresight">foresight</a> for the duration of the performance.

This performance replaces deadly performance.
