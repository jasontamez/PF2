These charismatic witches, often devotees of the Green Mother, rely on their otherworldly charms to achieve their aims. A seducer focuses on enchantments, turning enemies into friends and friends into toys for her amusement.

Patron: A seducer must select deception, enchantment, plant (Pathfinder Player Companion Heroes of the Wild 11), thorns (Heroes of the Wild 13), or trickery as her patron.

Otherworldly Allure: A seducer's power comes from her allure. She uses her Charisma rather than her Intelligence score for the purpose of all class features and effects related to her witch class, such as bonus spells per day, the maximum spell level she can cast, and save DCs of her spells and hexes.

Fey Charm (Su): A seducer gains the charm hex at 1st level. The save DC of this hex is increased by 1. If the target is (or could be) sexually attracted to the seducer, the save DC is instead increased by 2. If she and the target have had willing sexual relations in the past 24 hours, the save DC is instead increased by 3.

This ability alters the hex gained at 1st level.

Seducer's Kiss (Su): At 6th level, a seducer can kiss another creature as a melee touch attack. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + half the seducer's level + her Charisma modifier) or be staggered for 1 round. If the target is (or could be) sexually attracted to the seducer, the save DC is increased by 2. If the seducer and the target have had willing sexual relations in the past 24 hours, the save DC is instead increased by 4. Whether or not the creature succeeds at this save, it cannot be the target of this ability again for 1 day. At 10th level, this ability causes the target to become stunned for 1 round, then staggered for an additional round. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.

This ability replaces the hex gained at 6th level.

Garden of Delight (Su): At 8th level, the seducer can create a magical bower once per day. This functions as tiny hut with a caster level equal to the seducer's witch level, but the interior is a lush garden. Those who rest for 8 hours within the garden heal at twice the usual rate. In addition, any creature engaging in willing sexual relations with the seducer in this garden gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws for the next 24 hours. This bonus does not apply on saving throws against the seducer's spells or abilities.

This replaces the hex gained at 8th level.
