A cyclopean seer draws power from the mysterious prophetic abilities of ancient giants.

Recommended Mysteries:  Ancestor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 53), lore, nature, occult (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Occult Mysteries 53), time (Ultimate Magic 56).

Class Skills:  A cyclopean seer adds Linguistics and all Knowledge skills to her list of class skills. These replace the additional class skills granted by her mystery.

Oracle's Curse:  A cyclopean seer must choose the haunted, hunger (see above), powerless prophecy (see above), or tongues curse at 1st level.

Bonus Spells:  Each time a cyclopean seer would gain a bonus spell from her mystery, she instead selects a divination spell from any class's spell list. If the spell is not on the cleric spell list, it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level oracle spell the cyclopean seer can cast. This ability alters the bonus spells granted by the oracle's mystery.

Assume Fate (Su):  As an immediate action when targeted by an effect that requires a saving throw, you can choose another creature within line of sight that is attempting a save against the same effect. The target takes a penalty on its saving throw equal to 1d4 + 1 for every 4 levels you possess. You gain the value of their penalty as a luck bonus on your saving throw. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This replaces the revelation gained at 1st level.

Brutal Trance (Su):  Once per day as a standard action, you can enter a trance that lasts 1 round per oracle level you possess. While in this trance, you are confused, but each round that you can act normally, you can ask a single question as if using commune. This replaces the revelation gained at 7th level.

Revelations:  All cyclopean seers have access to the following revelations, regardless of their chosen mysteries. Doomsaying (Su): As a standard action, you can pronounce doom on a creature within 30 feet. The target takes a penalty equal to your oracle level on either all skill checks, all savings throws, or all attack rolls (your choice) for 1 minute or until he fails one such roll. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. This is a curse effect (Ultimate Magic 137).

Flash of Insight (Su): You gain the cyclops racial ability of the same name (Bestiary 52). If you already possess this ability, you gain an additional daily use.

Prescience (Ex): You gain a +2 bonus to your Armor Class against attacks of opportunity and a +2 bonus on concentration checks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1.

This ability alters the revelation class feature.

Final Revelation:  Upon reaching 20th level, you embody ancient cyclopes' insight. You can use each of the following once per day as a spell-like ability: discern location, prying eyes, and stone tell. In addition, using flash of insight to select a d20 roll result equal to or lower than your Charisma modifier doesn't expend that ability. This replaces the final revelation of the oracle's mystery.
