Sages are masters of useful facts, able to recall them for their masters' benefit, though this leads many to become haughty and proud.

Sage Skills: A sage treats all Knowledge skills as class skills.

Dazzling Intellect (Ex): A sage's Intelligence score is always equal to 5 + its master's class level, but it gains natural armor increases as if its master's class level were half what of the actual class level.

This alters the familiar's Intelligence score and natural armor adjustment.

Sage's Knowledge (Ex): A sage stores information on every topic and is happy to lecture its master on the finer points of a subject. A sage can attempt all Knowledge checks untrained and gains a bonus on Knowledge checks equal to half its master's class level. Additionally, a sage gains 2 skill ranks each time its master gains a class level. Its maximum number of ranks in any given skill is equal to its master's class level.

This replaces alertness and the familiar's ability to share its master's skill ranks.
