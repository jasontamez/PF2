Vaultbreaker

The vaultbreaker combines stealth with his bomb-making talents to construct special focused charges that can disable or destroy hinges, locks, and similar mechanisms.

Breaking and Entering (Ex): A vaultbreaker gains Stealth as a class skill and can disarm magical traps as if he were a <a href="classdisplay8ec3.html?ItemName=Rogue">rogue with the trapfinding ability</a>.

This ability replaces the Brew Potion bonus feat.

Rogue Talents: A vaultbreaker can choose any of the following <a href="_roguetalents.html">rogue talents</a> in place of a discovery: expert leaper, fast stealth, ledge walker, nimble climber, or wall scramble.

This ability alters discoveries.

Safecracking (Ex): At 1st level, a vaultbreaker's bombs can help him disable locks. He gains penetrating charge as a bonus discovery. Because this ability replaces <a href="featdisplay8204.html?ItemName=Throw%20Anything">Throw Anything</a>, the vaultbreaker's bombs do not add his Intelligence bonus to damage rolls.

This ability alters bombs and replaces the Throw Anything bonus feat.

Enhanced Safecracking (Ex): At 3rd level, a vaultbreaker gains incendiary charge as a bonus discovery, and his incendiary charges ignore 10 points of an object's hardness instead of 5.

This ability alters bombs and replaces the poison use class ability.
