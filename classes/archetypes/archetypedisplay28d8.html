Metamorphs eschew traditional alchemy, focusing on internal chemistry and the transfiguration of living forms.

Class Skills: A metamorph adds Disguise to her list of class skills.

This alters the alchemist's class skills.

Shapechanger (Su): At 1st level, a metamorph gains the ability to transform herself into another form. This ability functions like <a href="spelldisplay3b5b.html?ItemName=alter%20self">alter self</a>, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per metamorph's alchemist level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to another form or back) is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The metamorph is fatigued for 1 round each time she changes shape.

A metamorph can use this ability once per day at 1st level, and an additional time per day at 4th level, and every 2 alchemist levels thereafter, for a total of nine times at 18th level. At 20th level, a metamorph can use shapechanger as a free action once per round, either before or after all her other actions, with no daily limit.

This ability can also function as <a href="spelldisplay5e9e.html?ItemName=monstrous%20physique%20I">monstrous physique I</a> at 5th level, as <a href="spelldisplay0b7d.html?ItemName=monstrous%20physique%20II">monstrous physique II</a> at 9th level, as <a href="spelldisplay927e.html?ItemName=monstrous%20physique%20III">monstrous physique III</a> at 11th level, as <a href="spelldisplayc4e5-2.html?ItemName=monstrous%20physique%20IV">monstrous physique IV</a> or <a href="spelldisplayab76.html?ItemName=giant%20form%20I">giant form I</a> at 13th level, and as <a href="spelldisplay7ed6.html?ItemName=giant%20form%20II">giant form II</a> at 15th level.

This ability replaces alchemy (which also includes bombs, extracts, and mutagen) and Throw Anything.

Mutagen (Ex): At 1st level, a metamorph gains mutagen as a normal alchemist. She can take mutagen and cognatogen discoveries despite not possessing the alchemy class feature that normally grants mutagen.

Adaptive Physiology (Ex): At 3rd level, a metamorph gains a 25% chance to negate critical hits and precision damage, similar to the preserve organs discovery. This chance increases to 50% at 6th level, and to 75% at 18th level.

This ability replaces swift alchemy, swift poisoning, and instant alchemy.
