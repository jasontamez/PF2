Sha'irs delve into the occult not through power over objects but instead via their connection with minor servitor genies from the elemental planes. A sha'ir's jin is both a precious ally and a living implement for its master.

Jin (Su):  At 1st level, a sha'ir learns how to contact a jin-a minor, insubstantial genie that makes its home on the elemental planes. She learns how to contact a second jin at 6th level and a third jin at 14th level. Each of these jin is connected to one of the eight schools of magic, just like an occultist implement, but also to the air, earth, fire, or water school (Advanced Player's Guide 142). Each jin works like a living implement for both of its schools. To provide the implement component for a spell or focus power, a jin must be within 30 feet of its master.

The elemental schools don't have focus powers or resonant powers. Instead, the sha'ir considers all wizard spells of 6th level and lower from the lists corresponding to her jin's elemental schools to be on her occultist spell list. In addition, she adds additional spells to her list of spells known. For every spell level she can cast, she adds one spell from each jin's elemental school and one spell from each jin's non-elemental school.

A jin in its natural form has the base statistics of a Small elemental of the chosen type with the young simple template and without the air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, or whirlwind abilities.

At 20th level, a sha'ir selects one of her jin and chooses one of its two schools instead of selecting an implement for implement mastery.

If one of her jin is slain, the sha'ir is treated as if she didn't have the appropriate implement to cast the spells associated with that jin. The sha'ir can replace the slain jin the following morning by expending 1 point of mental focus in a special ritual that takes 1 hour to perform.

This ability replaces implements and alters mental focus, spellcasting, and implement mastery.

Augment Jin (Sp, Su):  Starting at 2nd level, a sha'ir's jin uses its master's base saving throws if they are better than its own, and it uses either its own hit point total or 1/2 its master's hit points, whichever is higher. At 4th level, a sha'ir can concentrate for 1 full round and expend 1 point of mental focus stored in a jin to grant that jin all the statistics of a Small elemental of its type for 1 round per occultist level (this includes gaining any of the following abilities, if applicable: air mastery, burn, drench, earth glide, earth mastery, vortex, water mastery, and whirlwind). At 8th level, she can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to give one of her jin all the statistics of a Medium elemental. At 10th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Medium elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus, and the sha'ir can give a jin all the statistics of a Large elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 12th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Large elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 14th level, the cost of giving a jin the statistics of a Huge elemental decreases to 1 point of mental focus and the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of a greater elemental for 2 points of mental focus. At 16th level, the sha'ir can give a jin the statistics of an elder elemental for 3 points of mental focus. This ability replaces magic item skill and object reading.

Manifest Jin (Su):  At 7th level, the sha'ir can designate one of her jin and manifest its powers, allowing it to count as a Small elemental at all times, as if using augment jin to augment it to a Small elemental but with a permanent duration. By concentrating for 1 full round, she can change which of her jin she manifests in this way. This ability replaces aura sight.

Jin Spy (Su):  At 8th level, when a sha'ir gains her outside contact ability, instead of learning the true names of outsiders, she can ask one or more of her jin to perform tasks. She chooses from the same tasks listed under outside contact (as appropriate to her occultist level). This doesn't require negotiation or gifts, but the jin is not available to the sha'ir during the time it spends performing these tasks. This ability alters outside contact.
