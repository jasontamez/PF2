While many cavaliers are the champions of old fighting forms, some younger, more daring cavaliers mix a martial style influenced by the lighter armored and more flamboyant swashbuckler forms with the dedication of cavalier orders.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  Daring champions are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light and medium armor, and bucklers. This replaces the cavalier's weapon and armor proficiencies.

Champion's Finesse (Ex):  At 1st level, a daring champion gains the benefits of the <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a> feat with light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, and he can use Charisma in place of Intelligence for the purpose of combat feats prerequisites. A daring champion also counts as having the <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a> feat for the purpose of meeting feat requirements. This ability replaces mount.

Nimble (Ex):  At 3rd level, a daring champion gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load. Anything that causes the daring champion to lose his Dexterity bonus to AC also causes him to lose this dodge bonus. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). This ability replaces cavalier's charge.

Panache and Deeds (Ex):  At 4th level, a daring champion gains the <a href="classdisplayfa4f.html?ItemName=Swashbuckler">swashbuckler's panache class feature</a>, along with the following <a href="_swashbucklerdeeds.html">swashbuckler deeds</a>: dodging panache, precise strike, and swashbuckler initiative. This ability replaces expert trainer.

Advanced Deeds (Ex):  At 11th level, a daring champion gains the following <a href="_swashbucklerdeeds.html">swashbuckler deeds</a>: superior feint, targeted strike, subtle blade, and dizzying defense. This ability replaces mighty charge.

Champion's Weapon Mastery (Ex):  At 20th level, when a daring champion threatens a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, that critical is automatically confirmed. Furthermore, the critical modifier of those weapons increases by 1 (??2 becomes ??3, for example). This ability replaces supreme charge.
