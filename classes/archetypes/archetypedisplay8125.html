Sometimes, when an insect or other vermin is chosen to be an animal companion, it proves cleverer than expected. On occasion, it proves much cleverer.

Special Requirement: Only vermin companions may become unexpected intellectuals.

Genius that Creeps and Crawls (Ex): The unexpected intellectual gains an Intelligence score of 2 and can gain skills and feats. It loses the mindless quality.

This replaces share spells.
