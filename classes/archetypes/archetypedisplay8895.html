Feral Champion

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 97</a>
When a warpriest devotes himself to a god of the natural world, he is sometimes blessed with supernatural powers that allow him to evoke animalistic power and fury.

Feral Blessing: A feral champion must take the Animal blessing and does not gain a second blessing.

This alters blessings.

Sacred Claws (Su): Rather than empowering a physical weapon, a feral champion grows claws as primary natural weapons on each hand. These claws deal damage as a warpriest's sacred weapon and can be enhanced as such.

This alters sacred weapon.

Wild Shape (Su): At 7th level, a feral champion gains wild shape, as the druid ability of the same name, and treats his warpriest level - 3 as his effective druid level for the purposes of this ability. However, a feral champion does not gain the ability to take on elemental or plant forms with wild shape. A feral champion can use wild shape once per day at 7th level and one additional time per day every 4 levels thereafter, for a total of four times per day at 19th level.

This replaces sacred armor.
