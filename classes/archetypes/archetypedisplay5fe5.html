The city of Katheer is home to a great number of arcane colleges in the Qadiran tradition. Magic has a proud history in this land; its many schools compete with one another to find the best route to understanding the secrets of power.

Among these is the focused school of veil magic. Rather than controlling the elements or transforming the environment, mages of the veil focus on much more subtle magic-blending into their surroundings to watch, observe, and gather secrets, or fading from view completely for the sake of solitude. Most graduates of this college enter the service of the satrap as spies, scouts, or infiltrators.

Associated School: Illusion.

Requirements: A mage of the veil must select disguise self as one of his spells known at 1st level.

Class Skills: A mage of the veil gains Bluff, Disguise, and Stealth as class skills.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the blinding ray and invisibility field powers of the illusion school.

Face in the Crowd (Sp): At 1st level as a standard action, you can cause yourself to appear so normal, mundane, and unexceptional that you blend in to your surroundings. All creatures within 30 feet treat you as if you belonged there, effectively ignoring you. Creatures outside of this area may notice that you appear out of place, but as soon as they approach within 30 feet they are affected by the magic and no longer think something is amiss. If you interact with an affected creature in any way, it gains a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) to disbelieve the illusion and notice you. The effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your wizard level, or until the illusion is dispelled. The minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a mind-affecting phantasm effect.

This ability does not turn you invisible and opponents are not considered flat-footed. It does not allow you to disguise yourself as a specific individual, type of person, or member of another race, so you cannot blend into a group of uniformed guards or appear as a member of an individual's family, and a human cannot blend into a group of gnolls. You can blend in with any group made up of different types of people, such as a crowd of courtiers in a king's throne room, and you can disguise yourself (either through magic or more mundane means) to appear as a specific type of person or another race (such as a uniformed guard or a gnoll) before using this ability.

Master of the Veil (Sp): At 8th level, you can create an illusion that hides the appearance of yourself and any number of allies within 30 feet for 1 round per wizard level. This ability otherwise functions like the spell veil. The rounds do not need to be consecutive.
