Drowned Channeler

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9q00?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Aquatic-Adventures">Aquatic Adventures pg. 52</a>
When a drowned spirit doomed to a watery grave descends toward the evil of undeath and seeks refuge in a mortal shell, the result is an unusual spiritualist with powers that resonate with the drowned spirit's demise.

Class Skills: A drowned channeler has Swim as a class skill instead of Fly.

This alters the spiritualist's class skills.

Drowned Phantom: A drowned channeler has a drowned phantom. A drowned phantom's ectoplasmic body drips with water and seems to bleed off watery droplets even its incorporeal form. A drowned phantom gains a swim speed of 30 feet in both forms and gains the water subtype in addition to the phantom subtype, meaning that it can use its natural slam attacks underwater without taking the penalty for bludgeoning attacks underwater. The drowned channeler's etheric tether extends twice as far underwater, but only half as far above water. Additionally, the drowned phantom doesn't grant any of the usual benefits while confined in the drowned channeler's consciousness unless the drowned channeler is within 25 feet of an ocean, sea, lake, or other large body of water. Both forms of bonded manifestation grant the drowned phantom's swim speed of 30 feet to the drowned channeler, and attacks from the ectoplasmic bonded manifestation's tendrils don't take the typical penalties for bludgeoning attacks underwater, as if the phantom itself made them.

This ability alters phantom, shared consciousness, etheric tether, and bonded manifestation.

Drowned Spells: At 2nd level, a drowned channeler adds control water, fluid form, hydraulic push, hydraulic torrent, life current*, pressure adaptation*, ride the waves, slipstream, stabilize pressure*, unlife current*, water breathing, and wave form* to the spiritualist spell list at the same spell level as they appear on the cleric list or sorcerer/wizard list, whichever is lower. Spells marked with an asterisk (*) appear in the Aquatic Spells section of this book (see page 59). The drowned channeler must still select them as spells known as normal.

This ability replaces bonded senses.

Drowned Powers (Sp): At 5th level, a drowned channeler can use hydraulic push as a spell-like ability once per day, with an additional use each day at 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 7th level, she can use slipstream once per day as a spell-like ability, with an additional use each day at 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter. At 9th level, she can use ride the waves once per day as a spell-like ability. Finally, at 16th level, she can use fluid form once per day as a spell-like ability.

This ability replaces detect undead, calm spirit, see invisibility, and call spirit.
