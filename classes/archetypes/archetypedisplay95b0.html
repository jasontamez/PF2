Lantern lighters were originally entrusted with secretly eliminating the drow and quarantining any knowledge of their existence, but in the new Lantern Bearer era, the lantern lighters have refocused their efforts on helping to rescue those imprisoned by the drow, or even to help individual drow who seek to escape the cruelties of their society for a chance at redemption on the surface. Of course, escape from drow society is only the beginning of a drow's long and fraught path to redemption, and even the kindest or most repentant drow are likely to face prejudice from most of those who recognize her origins. In addition to their rescue efforts, lantern lighters often serve as sponsors for escapees and work to create pockets of civilization where redeemed drow can live in relative peace and safety by encouraging surface dwellers to cast aside the lurking shadows of prejudice and fear.

While the vast majority of lantern lighters are elves from Kyonin, a few non-elven members of the organization have proven themselves trustworthy and dedicated enough to join their ranks. As their efforts to spread the light to other regions beyond Kyonin grow, lantern lighters of other races are beginning to round out the order's numbers, particularly in areas and regions that suffer under oppressive regimes.

Daylight: A lantern lighter treats daylight as a 3rd-level ranger spell.

Darkvision (Ex): At 8th level, a lantern lighter's senses fully attune to the darkness, granting him darkvision to a distance of 60 feet. If the lantern lighter already has darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.

Poison Immunity (Ex): At 12th level, a lantern lighter gains immunity to poison.

Stunning Light (Su): At 13th level, a lantern lighter learns to increase the effectiveness of bright light on creatures with light blindness.

This ability replaces the favored terrain gained at 13th level.

Camouflage (Ex): At 17th level, a lantern lighter gains camouflage, as the ranger class feature.

Paralyzing Light (Su): At 18th level, a lantern lighter can stop light-blind enemies in their tracks, often gaining a great edge in battle.

This ability replaces the favored terrain gained at 18th level.
