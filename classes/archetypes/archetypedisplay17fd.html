A reincarnated oracle draws her knowledge and power from the experiences of her previous lives. Her memories guide her through a spiritual ascension leading the way to her ultimate incarnation. A reincarnated oracle has the following class features.

Recommended Mysteries:  ancestor, lore, time.

Oracle's Curse:  A reincarnated oracle must choose the haunted or tongues curse at 1st level.

Bonus Spells:  see alignment (2nd), detect thoughts (4th), contact other plane (10th), moment of prescience (16th), overwhelming presence (18th). These spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells at these levels.

Revelations:  A reincarnated oracle must take the following revelations at one of the listed levels.

Location Memories (Su): As a swift action, you may search your past lives for memories of or insight about your current location. This grants you the scent ability, low-light vision, and a +2 insight bonus on Perception and Survival checks for 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level or 3rd level.

Spirit Memories (Su): Once per day, you call upon the unfulfilled desires and goals of your past lives and project their frustration and despair through your eyes at a target. This is a gaze attack affecting one creature. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier) or be sickened and staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st, 3rd, or 7th level.
