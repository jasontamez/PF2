Arcane Tinkerer

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01vam">Construct Handbook pg. 10</a>
All constructs are animated by magic in some capacity. Arcane tinkerers use their knowledge and understanding of magic to disrupt or even destroy constructs.

Manipulate Construct (Su): An arcane tinkerer can turn the animating magic of a construct against itself. As a standard action, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to impose a -1 penalty on a single construct's attack and damage rolls for 1 round. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + half the arcane tinkerer's level + the arcane tinkerer's Charisma modifier). At 7th level, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, an arcane tinkerer can improve her manipulate construct ability to instead affect a construct with <a href="spelldisplay4015.html?ItemName=Slow">slow</a> for 1 round. At 13th level, if the arcane tinkerer has previously improved this ability, instead of gaining an arcanist exploit, she can improve this ability again to instead cause a construct to become helpless for 1 round.

This replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.

Break Magic Immunity (Su): At 5th level, an arcane tinkerer can overcome a construct's immunity to magic. When targeting a construct with a spell, the construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to 15 + the construct's CR. At 11th level, a construct is instead treated as if it has spell resistance equal to 11 + the construct's CR.

This replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 5th and 11th level.
