Dragonheir Scion

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nfl?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-Dragons">Legacy of Dragons pg. 12</a>
Dragonheir scions are the martially inclined humanoid descendants of those influenced by draconic power. Unlike their sorcerous brethren, dragonheir scions manifest their heritage in ways more suited to strength of arms and skill with steel than arcane energies. Those who follow this path are often the children of mighty dragon-blooded sorcerers and others who drew energy from their dragon blood, though they themselves might not exhibit spellcasting ability.


Class Skills
: The dragonheir scion adds Knowledge (arcana) and Use Magic Device to her list of class skills, instead of Handle Animal or Ride.

This alters the fighter's class skills.


Draconic Bloodline (Su): Each dragonheir scion can draw her lineage back to the influence of a great draconic progenitor. At 1st level, a dragonheir scion must select one of the chromatic or metallic dragon types. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. A number of dragonheir scion's abilities deal damage and grant resistances based on her dragon type, as noted below. If a dragonheir scion takes a level in another class that grants a bloodline, the bloodlines must be of the same type, even if that means that the bloodline of one of the classes must change. Subject to GM discretion, the dragonheir scion can change her former bloodline to make them conform.

This ability replaces bravery.


Draconic Defense (Su) : At 3rd level, a dragonheir scion gains a +1 natural armor bonus and energy resistance 5 against her energy type.

Wings (Su): At 15th level, a dragonheir scion can grow leathery dragon wings from her back as a standard action, granting her a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. She can dismiss the wings as a free action.
