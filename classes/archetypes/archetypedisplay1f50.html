There are some clerics who take their pursuit of purity and light to extremes. These clerics are known as blossoming lights, and forsake armor and weaponry in favor of opening their hearts to pure goodness. Many are peace-loving or even pacifistic, and nearly every blossoming light favors redemption over righteous wrath.

Blossoming lights are primarily found among the Lantern Bearers, as their powers are a great boon against the organization's foes. Despite this, their ways did not originate with elvenkind. Legend tells that Sarenrae, horrified by the consequences of the destruction of Gormuz, reached out to one of that city's survivors. She granted the frightened woman divine powers to guide her fellow survivors, both to safety and to goodness, and humbly asked her to spread the message of redemption and forgiveness. While this priestess's identity has been lost to history, the Dawnflower's imparted wisdom has not.

Within the Lantern Bearers, given their growing alliance with Sarenrae's faith, the traditions of the blossoming light have found the perfect place to flourish. These clerics are increasingly at the vanguard of the organization's efforts to redeem the fallen, particularly drow who seek to escape their society's strictures.

Promise of Faith: A blossoming light vows to trust in her deity's protection over arms and armor. She is not proficient with any armor or shields. The blossoming light cannot use or benefit from any of her class features (including spellcasting) while wearing armor or using a shield, or for 1 minute thereafter.

This ability alters the cleric's armor proficiencies.

Promise of Purity: A blossoming light must be truly pure of heart. She must be good-aligned and worship a nonevil deity. If the blossoming light willfully commits an evil act, she loses all class features (including spellcasting) until she atones.

This alters the cleric's alignment.

Luminous Font (Su): A blossoming light forsakes her deity's deeper mysteries to focus on benevolence, healing, and bringing light to darkness. A blossoming light still selects domains and retains access to domain powers, but does not gain domain spell slots. Blossoming lights are beacons of goodness, guiding others to follow their own best natures. A blossoming light adds half her level on Diplomacy checks against good creatures or to convince an evil creature to take an action against its evil nature.

A blossoming light's channel energy is usable a number of times per day equal to 5 + her Charisma modifier. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the blossoming light gains an additional use per day of channel energy.

At 3rd level, when a blossoming light channels energy to harm undead, her channeled energy also harms chaotic evil outsiders, worshipers of chaotic evil deities, and evil creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness as if they were undead.

At 7th level, when a blossoming light channels energy, she can expend an additional use to fill the affected area with bright light (as per daylight) for a number of rounds equal to her cleric level.

At 10th level, a blossoming light can use atonement once per day as a spell-like ability, but only to offer redemption to others (as per the spell). Using the spell in this way does not require a focus or material component.

This ability alters channel energy and the cleric's domains.
