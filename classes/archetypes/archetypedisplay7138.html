Dual-Cursed Oracle

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 58</a>
All oracles are cursed to some degree, but some oracles bear an even heavier burden. Though doubly afflicted with supernatural or physical hindrances, a dual-cursed oracle can manipulate fortune and gains greater insights into her mystery.

Recommended Mysteries:  Any.

Oracle's Curse:  A dual-cursed oracle must choose two curses at 1st level. One of these curses (oracle's choice) never changes its abilities as the oracle gains levels; for example, an oracle with clouded vision never gains darkvision 60 feet, blindsense, or blindsight. The other curse comes with its normal benefits.

Class Skills:  A dual-cursed oracle gains no additional class skills from her mystery.

Bonus Spells:  ill omen (2nd), oracle's burden (4th), bestow curse (6th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells at these levels.

Revelations:  A dual-cursed oracle gains a new revelation at 5th level and 13th level. These are in addition to the normal revelations she receives at 3rd level, 7th level, and so on. In addition, the cursed oracle may select the following revelations in place of a mystery revelation.

Misfortune (Ex): At 1st level, as an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any one d20 roll that it has just made before the results of the roll are revealed. The creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. Once a creature has suffered from your misfortune, it cannot be the target of this revelation again for 1 day.

Fortune (Ex): At 5th level, as an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. You can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every six oracle levels beyond 5th.
