Some companions live lives of faithful devotion and steady vigilance, standing watch through long hours and always ready to leap into action to protect their masters.

Animal Feats: In addition to the standard feats available to animal companions, a bodyguard can select Bodyguard, Combat Patrol, Heroic Defiance, Heroic Recovery, and In Harm's Way.

Shared Vigilance (Ex): Both a bodyguard and its master gain Alertness as a bonus feat whenever they are adjacent.

This replaces share spells.

Tenacious Guardian (Ex): At 3rd level, a bodyguard can always act in a surprise round (though it remains flat-footed until it acts). As long as its master is adjacent, a bodyguard remains conscious (though it becomes staggered) when its hit points fall below 0. While below 0 hit points, the bodyguard loses 1 hit point per round but gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, dying only if its hit points reach a negative total equal to its Constitution score plus its master's class level.

This replaces evasion.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 9th level, a bodyguard gains uncanny dodge as per the rogue class feature of the same name.

This replaces Multiattack.

Greater Tenacity (Ex): At 15th level, a bodyguard with fewer than 0 hit points gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; immunity to fear effects; and temporary hit points equal to its master's class level (maximum 20). It dies only if its hit points reach a negative total equal to twice its Constitution score plus its master's class level.

This replaces improved evasion.
