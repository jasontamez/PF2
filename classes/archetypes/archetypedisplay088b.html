Once practiced by the dwarves in their Quest for Sky, the traditions of the stonesinger bards changed when the dwarves arrived on the surface. The tradition still hearkens back to its subterranean origins, however, and is practiced as a form of meditation or worship by many dwarves. Stonesingers are rare bards capable of vocalizing their bardic performances through subsonic harmonies, allowing their performances to carry as subtle vibrations through stone, rather than through the air. They command considerable power underground.

Earth Magic: A stonesinger is treated as having the Eschew Materials feat so long as he is touching natural or manufactured stone. Additionally, a stonesinger adds the following spells to the bard spell list at the listed level: 1-<a href="spelldisplaya63a.html?ItemName=magic%20stone">magic stone</a>, 2-<a href="spelldisplay92e2.html?ItemName=stone%20shield">stone shield</a>, 3-<a href="spelldisplay5dc8.html?ItemName=stone%20shape">stone shape</a>, 4-<a href="spelldisplay11d9.html?ItemName=earth%20glide">earth glide</a>, 5-<a href="spelldisplay190b.html?ItemName=stoneskin">stoneskin</a>, 6-<a href="spelldisplayea0c.html?ItemName=stone%20tell">stone tell</a>.

This ability alters spellcasting.

Stone Song (Su): A stonesinger's bardic performance is a subsonic vibration that resonates from his body and travels through solid rock. This vibration is subtle enough to not be heard, though creatures with the tremorsense universal monster ability can distinctly hear the stone song out to a range of 100 feet per bard level. All allies within 30 feet of the stonesinger benefit from stone song, perceiving the effect due to proximity. An allied creature with tremorsense benefits from stone song as long as it's within the extended range, provided that there is an unobstructed path of solid earth between the creature and stonesinger. Natural and manufactured stone does not inhibit stone song's range. A stonesinger must use Perform (song) or Perform (oratory) for this bardic performance.

This ability modifies bardic performance.

Tremor (Su): As part of another bardic performance, a stonesinger can cause the ground within 30 feet to tremble, throwing enemies off balance and causing them to take a -1 circumstance penalty to AC as long as the stonesinger continues performing. This penalty increases by 1 at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. Creatures levitating or flying above the ground are unaffected by this ability.

This replaces countersong.

Quake (Su): At 8th level, a stonesinger causes the ground to shudder and buckle with his song. All enemies within 30 feet of the stonesinger must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the stonesinger's level + his Charisma bonus) when he begins a bardic performance or be knocked prone. Prone and flying creatures, as well as creatures with the earth glide universal monster ability, are unaffected by this performance.

This replaces dirge of doom.
