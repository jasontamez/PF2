According to dwarven legend, the first deep marshals were handpicked by King Taargick himself to create massive tunnels to aid in the dwarven exodus to Golarion's surface during the Quest for Sky. Largely unseen by visitors, the deep marshals have survived into the modern era as keepers, protectors, and repairers of the myriad of stony passages that travel around, through, and under the Five Kings Mountains. Although the vast majority of deep marshals are dwarves, a few non-dwarves have earned enough trust to be trained as deep marshals, or have learned the same techniques from studying old dwarven spellbooks.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  A deep marshal is proficient with light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). A deep marshal can cast magus spells while wearing light armor or medium armor without incurring the normal spell failure chance. In addition, a deep marshal gains the heavy armor magus ability at 9th level. This ability alters the magus's armor proficiencies, the medium armor class feature, and the heavy armor class feature.

Deep Spellcasting:  A deep marshal learns numerous arcane secrets involving the shaping and warding of earth and stone. She adds the following sorcerer/wizard spells to her magus spell list as magus spells of the same level: crafter's curse, crafter's fortune, erase, expeditious excavation, fabricate, greater make whole (Technology Guide 10), knock, major creation, make whole, mending, minor creation, move earth, passwall, stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, and all 0- through 6th-level sorcerer/wizard spells of the abjuration school. She must still add such spells to her spellbook to prepare them. If a spell appears on both the magus and sorcerer/wizard spell lists, the magus uses the lower of the two spell levels listed for the spell. A deep marshal cannot cast spells from the enchantment, illusion, or necromancy school and she cannot activate spellcompletion or spell-trigger magic items that use spells from those schools (without making a successful Use Magic Device check). This alters the magus's spellcasting.

Bound by Tradition:  A deep marshal is limited in how she can use her arcane powers. Her arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/3 her magus level (minimum 1) + her Intelligence modifier. Furthermore, she cannot use her arcane pool to grant an enhancement bonus or weapon special ability to a weapon she is holding unless it is a battleaxe, heavy pick, warhammer, or weapon with the word "dwarven" in its name. She can use her spell combat or spellstrike abilities only with such weapons. This alters arcane pool, spell combat, and spellstrike.

Miner's Focus (Su/Ex):  At 3rd level, a deep marshal can use the magical properties of her weapon in order to augment her spellcasting. Whenever she casts a magus spell while wielding a magic battleaxe, heavy pick, warhammer, or weapon with the word "dwarven" in its name, she adds half the weapon's enhancement bonus to the her caster level (minimum +1). When attempting a caster level check to overcome spell resistance, she instead adds her weapon's full enhancement bonus.

In addition, she is treated as having a number of ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Profession (miner) equal to her magus level, and she attempts Profession (miner) checks using her Intelligence modifier instead of her Wisdom modifier.

This ability replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd level.
