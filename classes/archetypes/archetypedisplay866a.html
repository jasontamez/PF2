Kobolds know there's strength in numbers, and they
rarely send fewer than two kobolds out on patrol. This
reliance on one another extends to combat tactics too-
overwhelming numbers and tight quarters are the kobold
fighter's friends. Scuttling between the legs of friend and
foe alike, the swarm fighter is an unshakable combatant.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A swarm fighter is
proficient with all simple and martial weapons. She is
proficient with light and medium armor, but not with
shields.

Athletic Prowess (Ex): A swarm fighter adds Acrobatics
and Climb to her class skills, and gains a bonus on checks
with these skills equal to 1/2 her swarm fighter level.

Mobility (Ex): The swarm fighter gains Mobility as a
bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

This replaces the bonus feat a fighter gains at first level,
and can't be replaced at a later level.

Safety in Numbers (Ex): A swarm fighter benefits greatly
from the proximity of her allies. She gains a morale bonus
on saves against fear effects equal to the number of allies
within 20 feet of her. This bonus can't exceed half her level.

This ability replaces bravery.

Bonus Teamwork Feats (Ex): At 2nd level and every
4 levels thereafter, the swarm fighter gains a bonus
Teamwork Feat.

This ability replaces the bonus combat feats the fighter
normally receives at those levels.

Bonus Feats (Ex): At 4th level, and every 4 levels
thereafter, the swarm fighter gains a bonus combat feat.
These are gained as with the fighter's normal bonus feats
class feature (but less frequently).

Share Space (Ex): At 5th level, the swarm fighter can
move into the space of another creature at least one size
category larger than she is. She may end her movement in,
and make attacks from, that space. She must succeed at the
Acrobatics check for moving through an occupied square
to move into a space occupied by an enemy. While sharing
the space of another creature, she gains a +2 shield bonus
to AC and a +1 circumstance bonus on Reflex saves.

This ability replaces weapon training 1.

Strike the Underbelly (Ex): At 9th level, creatures
with which the swarm fighter shares a space are denied
their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against the swam
fighter's attacks.

This ability replaces weapon training 2.

Always Underfoot (Ex): At 13th level, the swarm fighter
gains Step Up as a bonus feat. A creature sharing a square
with the swarm fighter is considered adjacent for the
purposes of this feat. At 17th level, the swarm fighter gains
Following Step as a bonus feat.

These abilities replace weapon training 3 and 4.

Soft Underbelly (Ex): At 20th level, any attacks made
against creatures with which the swarm fighter shares a
space automatically confirm all critical threats.

This ability replaces weapon mastery.
