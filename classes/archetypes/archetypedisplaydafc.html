Bards who have successfully mastered the strict curriculum of Pitax's Academy of Grand Arts to graduate are more adept in their assigned field of performance, at the expense of versatility in other areas. Such bards have the focused performance alternate class ability, which replaces versatile performance.

Focused Performance (Ex): At 2nd level, a bard must choose one type of Perform skill. The bard gains <a href="featdisplayd701.html?ItemName=Extra%20Performance">Extra Performance</a> as a bonus feat, usable only with the chosen category of the Perform skill. At 8th level, and every 6 levels thereafter, the bard gains Extra Performance as an additional bonus feat. The additional uses of bardic performance gained from these feats cannot be used with any category of the Performance skill other than the one chosen at 2nd level.
