Verdant Shifter

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 83</a>
Verdant shifters have an affinity for plants rather than animals and gain a plantlike form that grows in power as they do. Verdant shifters are the enemies of creatures that would despoil the natural world, and they seek to maintain balance with civilization and industry to ensure the sanctity of wild spaces.

Speak with Plants (Sp): At 1st level, a verdant shifter gains the ability to cast speak with plants as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 plus her Charisma modifier.

This replaces wild empathy.

Verdant Body (Su): At 1st level, a verdant shifter takes on plant qualities as vines grow over her body, flowers bloom in her hair, and bark grows from her skin. The verdant shifter is treated as both her normal creature type and a plant creature for purposes of spells or effects that target a creature by type (such as bane weapons and a ranger's favored enemy). Verdant body also grants the verdant shifter a 25% immunity to critical hits and precision damage (such as sneak attack).

At 5th level, the verdant shifter gains a +2 enhancement bonus to her Constitution score. At 8th level, the enhancement bonus to her Constitution score increases to +4 and her immunity to critical hits increases to 50%. At 15th level, the enhancement bonus her Constitution score increases to +6.

This replaces shifter aspect and all improvements of shifter aspect.

Wild Armor (Ex): At 2nd level, a verdant shifter gains a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC while unencumbered and either wearing no armor or wearing light or medium nonmetal armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of a +7 natural armor bonus to AC at 20th level.

This replaces defensive instinct.

Plant Shape (Su): At 6th level, a verdant shifter's wild shape ability instead functions as plant shape I. The verdant shifter can maintain this form for a number of rounds per day equal to her shifter level. At 12th level, this ability instead functions as plant shape II, and at 18th level, it functions as plant shape III. This ability otherwise functions as the standard wild shape shifter class feature.

This alters wild shape and replaces chimeric form and greater chimeric form.
