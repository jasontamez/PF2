The deleterious effects of the weird hazards of the Mana Wastes require special skill to remedy. Many wasteland blightbreakers are also <a href="archetypedisplayb962.html?FixedName=Alchemist%20Chirurgeon">chirurgeons</a>.

Healing Infusion (Sp, Su): At 2nd level, the blightbreaker can prepare extracts of the healing subschool as if he had the infusion discovery and can choose to render any such extracts inert and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue to occupy the alchemist's daily extract slots until consumed or used). If the blightbreaker has the infusion discovery, or if he is also a <a href="archetypedisplayb962.html?FixedName=Alchemist%20Chirurgeon">chirurgeon</a>, he can use <a href="spelldisplay2b26.html?ItemName=touch%20injection">touch injection</a> as a spell-like ability once per day as a standard action, but only to absorb an infusion of the healing subschool.

This ability replaces poison resistance +2.

Swift Healing Infusions (Sp): At 6th level, the blightbreaker can absorb an infusion of the healing subschool as if with <a href="spelldisplay2b26.html?ItemName=touch%20injection">touch injection</a> as a standard action an unlimited number of times per day. While he has a healing extract absorbed in this fashion, he can deliver it as a swift action.

This ability replaces swift poisoning.

Banish Blights (Su): At 8th level, a blightbreaker can end any effect affecting a creature that could be reversed by <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a>. To do so, the affected creature must imbibe one of the blightbreaker's infused extracts of the healing subschool of at least 3rd level. The blightbreaker must then attempt a caster level check as described in <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a>. If the blightbreaker succeeds at the check, the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. The blightbreaker can also use this ability to attempt to dispel primal magic events (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 12-13) affecting a creature or an area. To do so, the affected creature must imbibe an infused extract as described above, and the blightbreaker must attempt a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + the primal magic event's CR. If he succeeds at the check, the primal magic event ends as if the blightbreaker had successfully used dispel magic. If the blightbreaker attempts to dispel a primal magic event affecting an area, as a standard action, he must dump an infused extract of the healing subschool of at least 3rd level onto an affected square. He then must attempt a caster level check against a DC equal to 11 + the primal magic event's CR. If he succeeds at the check, the primal magic event ends as if the blightbreaker had successfully used <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>.

This ability replaces poison resistance +6 and the discovery gained at 8th level.

Discoveries: The following discoveries complement the wasteland blightbreaker archetype: dispelling bomb, elixir of life, healing bomb, healing touch, infusion, spontaneous healing.
