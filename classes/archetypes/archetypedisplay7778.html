Many wilderness areas contain the remnants of ancient civilizations, with some waiting to be discovered and some held by fierce monsters or devious cults. An occult historian seeks these ruins not only for their esoteric artifacts but also to learn the structures' secrets.

Ruin Reading (Su):  At 2nd level, an occult historian can glean secrets from ruined structures. She must spend 1 minute examining and touching part of the structure (such as a wall or a doorframe). At the end of the minute, the occult historian attempts a Knowledge (history) check. If the ruin has been claimed as a lair for a creature, the DC of this check is equal to 10 + the CR of the most powerful creature in the ruin. If the ruin holds a magic item (or multiple magic items), the DC of this check is equal to 11 + the highest caster level of all the magic items in the ruin. If the occult historian succeeds at the check, she learns the layout of the area of the ruin within 30 feet of her (including any secret doors), as well as a piece of information about the structure's history (as determined by the GM).

At 5th level, the occult historian can see into a ruin's past. This reveals the same information that can be gathered with the spell retrocognition, except the occult historian can use it only in ruins. If the occult historian succeeds at the check outlined above, she sees the events that occurred in the ruin over the past hour; for each minute she concentrates, she can see 1 additional hour into the ruin's past. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she can see the events that occurred over the past week, plus for 1 additional week per minute she concentrates. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she can see the events of the past year, plus for 1 additional year per minute she concentrates. If the result of her check exceeds the DC by 20 or more, she can see the events of the past century, plus for 1 additional century per minute she concentrates.

An occult historian can use ruin reading once per day, plus an additional time every 4 levels thereafter, to a maximum of five times per day at 18th level.

This replaces object reading and aura sight.

Trap Sense (Ex):  At 3rd level, an occult historian gains trap sense +1, as per the rogue class feature of the same name. This bonus improves by 1 for every 3 occultist levels gained after 3rd, to a maximum of +6 at 18th level. This replaces the focus power gained at 3rd level.

Crumbling Strike (Su):  At 12th level, an occult historian can channel the erosion of countless ages into a single melee strike. As a full-round action, the occult historian can make a melee attack against a single target at her highest base attack bonus. If she hits, she deals 2d6 points of damage per occultist level she has (maximum 40d6). If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (the save DC is equal to 10 + half the occult historian's occultist level + her Intelligence modifier), it takes only 5d6 points of damage. A creature slain by this attack crumbles to dust. The occult historian can use this ability once per day, plus an additional time per day at 16th and 20th levels.

This replaces outside contact 2, 3, and 4.
