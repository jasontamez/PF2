Far from the green fields of the world above lies a lightless expanse beneath the surface. This darkling fairyland is not without beauty and natural wonders of its own, and a few druids seek to preserve this hidden realm and purge it of the fell horrors that creep up from below.

Cavesense (Ex):  A underground druid adds Knowledge (dungeoneering) rather than Knowledge (geography) as a class skill and gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Survival skill checks. This ability replaces the nature sense ability.

Nature Bond:  A cave druid may select the Darkness domain in addition to the choices normally allowed, but may not select the Air or Weather domains.

Wild Empathy (Ex):  A cave druid can influence oozes, rather than magical beasts, with a -4 penalty on her wild empathy check.

Tunnelrunner (Ex):  At 2nd level, a cave druid can move through areas of rubble or narrow passages that require squeezing at her normal movement rate and without penalty. This ability replaces woodland stride.

Lightfoot (Ex):  At 3rd level, a cave druid cannot be detected with tremorsense. This ability replaces trackless step.

Resist Subterranean Corruption (Ex):  At 4th level, a cave druid gains a +2 bonus on saves against exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like abilities of oozes and aberrations. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Wild Shape (Su):  A cave druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level - 2. She cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level, the cave druid can assume the form of a Small or Medium ooze as if using beast shape III, and at 12th level that of a Tiny or Large ooze as if using beast shape IV (treating the ooze as if it were a magical beast without a natural armor bonus). When in ooze form, the cave druid has no discernible anatomy and is immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits.
