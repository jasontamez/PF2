The blending of martial prowess with elven magic has long been a staple of the Blackash Training Grounds in Erages. More than a few who study at Erages Academy follow this path because of the promises of wealth that the city's criminal element makes toward practiced brawlers and smugglers. Greensting slayers have the following class features.

Arcane Pool: At 1st level, a greensting slayer can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to add 1d6 points of sneak attack damage to his next melee attack that round. The attack must meet all of the usual prerequisites for making a sneak attack, as the rogue class feature. For every 4 levels beyond 1st, the amount of sneak attack damage dealt by this ability increases by 1d6 (to a maximum of 5d6 at 17th level). If a greensting slayer gets a sneak attack from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

A greensting slayer cannot use his arcane pool to enhance his weapon. This modifies the arcane pool ability.

Evasion (Ex): At 7th level, the greensting slayer gains evasion, as the rogue class feature. This replaces the medium armor ability.

Improved Evasion (Ex): At 13th level, the greensting slayer gains improved evasion, as the advanced rogue talent of the same name. This replaces the heavy armor ability.

Magus Arcana: In addition to the new magus arcana presented below, the following magus arcana complement the greensting slayer archetype: close range, hasted assault, maneuver mastery, pool strike, and silent magic.

Dark Shifter (Su): The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a move action to change the target of an ongoing spell effect with the darkness descriptor within 60 feet. The new target must be within the spell's range, using the magus's level as the effective caster level for the purpose of determining the maximum range the effect can be moved from the magus. If the spell effect the magus is moving originated from another creature, the magus must succeed at a caster level check to reposition the effect (DC = 11 + the effect's caster level). Failure wastes the magus's move action, but does not expend the point from his arcane pool. The magus must be at least 6th level before selecting this arcana.
