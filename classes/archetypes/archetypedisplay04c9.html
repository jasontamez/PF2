The emissary is touched by the divine, serving as a font of wisdom and a moral compass for its master.

Special Requirement: An emissary familiar can serve only a master who worships a single deity.

Emissary Skills: An emissary treats Heal, Knowledge (religion), and Sense Motive as class skills.

Divine Guidance (Sp): An emissary can cast guidance at will.

This replaces alertness.

Share Will (Su): Whenever an emissary or its master fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect that affects only one of them, the other can attempt the saving throw as well. If this second saving throw is a success, treat the original result as a success, and the emissary and its master can't use this ability again for 24 hours. On a failure, both the emissary and its master suffer the effects of the failed saving throw, even if one of them wouldn't ordinarily be a valid target.

This replaces share spells.

Domain Influence (Sp or Su): At 3rd level, the emissary gains a spark of divine power from the deity its master worships. Choose one of that deity's domains that grants a 1st-level domain power usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the user's Wisdom modifier. The emissary can use that power once per day.

This replaces deliver touch spells.
