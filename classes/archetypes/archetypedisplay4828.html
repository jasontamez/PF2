While all monks train in both unarmed combat and with weapons, the weapon adept seeks to become one with his weapons, transforming them into perfect extensions of his own body. Through such training, a weapon adept seeks to attain perfection by becoming a living weapon himself. A weapon adept has the following class features.

Perfect Strike (Ex):  At 1st level, a weapon adept gains Perfect Strike as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. At 10th level, the monk can roll his attack roll three times and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, he can choose which one of his other two rolls to use as his confirmation roll. This ability replaces Stunning Fist.

Way of the Weapon Master (Ex):  At 2nd level, a weapon adept gains Weapon Focus as a bonus feat with one of his monk weapons. At 6th level, the monk gains Weapon Specialization with the same weapon as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. This ability replaces evasion.

Evasion (Ex):  At 9th level, the monk gains evasion. This ability replaces improved evasion.

Uncanny Initiative (Ex):  At 17th level, a weapon adept does not need to roll for initiative. He always treats his initiative roll as if it resulted in any number of his choosing (from 1 to 20). This ability replaces timeless body.

Pure Power:  At 20th level, a weapon adept forsakes the ideals of the perfect self to become a bastion of the physical and mental virtues monks hold dear. The monk gains a +2 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom. This ability replaces perfect self.
