Not all spirits deserve reverence and respect. Some are twisted and despicable. It's a spirit warden's duty to end these spirits' existence.

Unnatural Mien (Ex):  At 1st level, the spirit warden's dealings with the spirit world give her an unsettling demeanor. Diplomacy and Handle Animal are not class skills for a spirit warden. Intimidate is added as a class skill, and she gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize a foe.

Restless Magic (Su):  The spirit warden adds the following spells to the list of spells she can cast using spirit magic: detect undead (1st), command undead (2nd), halt undead (3rd), death ward (4th), possess object (5th), undead to death (6th), ethereal jaunt (7th), control undead (8th), foresight (9th). This ability replaces the spirit magic spells gained from the shaman's spirit.

Rebuke Spirits (Su):  At 2nd level, the spirit warden gains the ability to channel positive energy as a cleric of her level. Regardless of her alignment, she can only use this ability to harm undead creatures. The spirit warden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.

Laugh at Death (Su):  At 10th level, the spirit warden's familiarity with the dead has filled her with contempt for death itself. She gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws against death effects and to avoid or remove negative levels. This ability replaces the hex gained at 10th level.
