Some oracles are possessed by spirits, demons, or similar beings. Instead of the possessed oracle drawing her powers from deities, these otherworldly forces work their magic through her.

Recommended Mysteries:  Any.

Oracle's Curse:  A possessed oracle must choose the haunted or tongues curse at 1st level.

Bonus Spells:  ventriloquism (1st), spider climb (4th), screech (6th), sleepwalk (8th), telekinesis (10th), animate objects (12th), divine vessel (16th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's normal mystery bonus spells at these levels.

Revelations:  A possessed oracle must take the following revelation at 1st level.

Two Minds (Su): You gain a +2 bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells or effects. At 7th level, you may reroll a failed Will save once per day as an immediate action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.
