Some witches can bend the warp and weft of fabric and thread.

Weapon Proficiency: A tatterdemalion is proficient with bolas, nets, and whips.

This alters the witch's weapon proficiencies.

Cantrips: A tatterdemalion must choose mage hand, open/ close, and prestidigitation as her prepared cantrips at 1st level, and they require a piece of cloth, string, rope, or other woven material (including clothing) as a focus. Any action she takes with these cantrips must involve the focus. Starting at 2nd level, she can choose any cantrip for her remaining cantrip.

This alters the witch's cantrips.

Dancing Strings (Su): A tatterdemalion adds animate rope to her class spell list and spells her familiar knows. She can control her clothing and cloth, rope, or woven fabric she wears in a manner otherwise identical to the prehensile hair hex.

This alters spells and replaces the hex gained at 1st level.

Witchweaver: A tatterdemalion gains the following unique hexes, with a caster level equal to her witch level.

Moth-Eaten (Sp): At 4th level, a tatterdemalion can make a touch attack that damages leather, rope, or cloth like rusting grasp damages metal, once per day per witch level.

Lace Weaver (Sp): At 8th level, a tatterdemalion can create cloth as per minor creation or create one 5-foot cube of tangled skeins of cloth per witch level, affecting the target areas as per web, once per day for every 4 witch levels she has.

Sinister Stitching (Su)<: At 12th level, once per day for every 4 witch levels she has, a tatterdemalion can conjure enchanted threads to hinder a creature she can see (Fortitude negates). The tatterdemalion can choose to either sew shut the target's eyes (blinding it) or mouth (preventing speech, bite attacks, breath weapons, verbal components, command words, and the like). The target can end the effect with a successful Strength check (DC = 15 + 1/2 the tatterdemalion's witch level) as a standard action, or by slashing the stitches with a magic slashing weapon as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Either way, the victim takes 1d4 points of bleed damage and either is dazzled (for stitched eyes) or takes a -2 penalty on bite attack and damage rolls and a 20% chance of spell failure with verbal components (for a stitched mouth). Either residual effect lasts 1 minute per witch level. Any creature can safely remove the enchanted threads with a minute of work and a successful DC 25 Heal check.

Unravel (Su): At 16th level, once per day when a tatterdemalion is hit by a melee or ranged attack, she can unravel herself as an immediate action, causing her body and gear to appear to collapse into a bundle of tattered rags and strands while she teleports to any open square within 30 feet. She takes no damage from the triggering attack, but she must have line of effect to the target square. She can use this ability twice per day at 20th level.

These replace the hexes gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.
