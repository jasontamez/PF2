Psychic magic draws upon the twin and sometimes opposed powers of thought and emotion, but an exciter cares little for rationality. The phantom that accompanies him fills him with unbridled exultation, as he lets feeling and passion rule and sharpen his mind and body into a glorious fusion.

Merged Phantom: An exciter internalizes his phantom and merges it completely within his mind. He cannot fully manifest his phantom outside of his own body in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. Emotional focus abilities that affect or require a manifested phantom are lost, except for any aura gained by the phantom at 7th level; if the phantom gains an aura at 7th level, this aura functions despite the phantom not being manifested, and is centered on the exciter.

This ability alters phantom and emotional focus and replaces the 6th-level phantom recall.

Rapture (Su): An exciter gains the ability to enter an ecstatic state in which he's consumed and overwhelmed by his passions and driven into a fighting fury. This functions similarly to a bloodrager's bloodrage (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 15), treating his spiritualist level as his bloodrager level, though he doesn't qualify for feats or other elements that require rage or bloodrage. When entering a rapture, the exciter loses all other benefits from having his phantom confined in his consciousness (such as the Skill Focus feats and bonus against mind-affecting effects), but he can choose to exchange the normal +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution scores normally gained from bloodrage for a +4 morale bonus to his Dexterity and Charisma scores or a +2 morale bonus to his Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma scores. In addition to the fatigue for ending a bloodrage, an exciter can't enter a rapture again for 1 minute after ending his last rapture.

This ability replaces a spiritualist's ability to manifest his phantom and use emotional focus abilities that require a manifested phantom.

Fast Movement (Ex): An exciter's land speed is faster than normal for his race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor and is not carrying a heavy load. This doesn't stack with the barbarian ability of the same name.

This ability replaces etheric tether.

Excitation (Su): At 2nd level, when an exciter is in a rapture, each round he can choose to intensify his emotional fury, expending 2 rounds of rapture instead of 1. When he uses excitation, he chooses one of the two abilities that his emotional focus would normally grant to a manifested phantom, such as strength focus and powerful strike for an anger phantom, or power from despair and miserable strike for a despair phantom. He gains these abilities until the beginning of his next turn. If the ability normally augments only a phantom's slam attacks, it instead applies to the ectoplasmic tendrils that the spiritualist can sprout using his ectoplasmic bonded manifestation.

This ability replaces bonded senses.

Rapturous Rage: At 10th level and every 4 spiritualist levels thereafter, an exciter can select one rage power for which he qualifies, treating his spiritualist level as his barbarian level for all purposes relating to that particular rage power (he still doesn't qualify for the Extra Rage Power feat or any similar abilities).

This ability replaces the 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level phantom recall and spiritual bond.

Perfect Passion (Su): At 4th level, an exciter can cast psychic spells with an emotion component (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144) even while in his rapture. He can cast these spells defensively and attempt concentration checks for these spells without impairment, despite being in a rapture. He also can attempt Charisma- and Intelligence-based skill checks related to psychic spells with an emotion component while in his rapture. He cannot cast arcane or divine spells or psychic spells that have a thought component while in a rapture.

This ability replaces spiritual interference.

Overwhelming Excitment (Su): At 10th level, an exciter can share the effects of his rapture with willing allies within 10 feet. He must expend 2 additional rounds of his rapture each round for each ally sharing its effects. The exciter's allies share all effects of the rapture except the rage powers; each ally must end its turn within 10 feet of the exciter, or the effects of the rapture end for that ally and it becomes fatigued. Whenever he is not sharing the effects of his rapture with an ally, the exciter now retains the benefits of his phantom in his consciousness even during rapture.

This ability replaces fused consciousness.

Greater Rapture (Su): At 12th level, an exciter increases the morale bonus his rapture grants to each applicable ability score by 2 and the morale bonus he gains on Will saves by 1. In addition, upon entering a rapture, he can apply the effects of a single spiritualist spell he knows with an emotion component to himself. The spell must have a range of touch  or personal, and it must be a 1st- or 2nd-level spell. For every 3 spiritualist levels he has beyond 12th, the maximum spell level of this spell increases by 1. If he uses this ability to apply the effects of a spell again before the duration of the previous spell expires, the previous spell ends immediately.

This replaces greater spiritual interference.
