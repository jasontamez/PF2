The fearmonger wants to do more than cause pain, misery, and confusion. He wishes to spread fear among his foes and infect entire populations with it. The fearmonger archetype is available only to the antipaladin alternate class.

Feed on Fear (Su):  At 2nd level, the first time in a round a creature fails a saving throw against a fear effect created by a fearmonger's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (including any ability that causes a creature to be shaken, frightened, or panicked), the fearmonger is healed of 1 point of damage per 2 antipaladin levels. If the fearmonger is at full hit points when this ability is activated, he instead gains an equal number of temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. Temporary hit points gained through multiple successful uses of this ability do not stack; the duration increases instead.

The antipaladin can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 his antipaladin level plus his Charisma bonus. This ability replaces touch of corruption.

Frightening Cruelty (Su):  The fearmonger must select shaken as his 3rd-level cruelty, dazed as his 6th-level cruelty, and frightened as his 9th-level cruelty. At 12th level, the fearmonger gains the panicked cruelty.

Panicked: The target is panicked for 1 round per 4 class levels the antipaladin possesses. The antipaladin must have the shaken and frightened cruelties before selecting this cruelty.

This class feature alters cruelty.
