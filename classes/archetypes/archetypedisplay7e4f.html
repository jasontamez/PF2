Portal Seeker

While most investigators seek answers to mundane mysteries, portal seekers chase more unusual enigmas: portals to other planes. While in many cases, portal seekers are boons to their communities, performing public services such as discovering planar rifts and, as needed, closing unwanted ones, a portal seeker's goals are not necessarily benign.

Hunt Portal (Sp): A portal seeker can try to locate an unseen magical portal within 60 feet by concentrating and attempting a DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. If successful, the portal seeker becomes aware of the presence of all extradimensional portals (including those created by spells like rope trick or by magic items like bags of holding) in a 60-foot radius. If she concentrates for 3 rounds, she can pinpoint the locations of all portals in the area of effect. Some portals, at the GM's discretion, may be magically hidden and have a higher DC to detect.

This replaces trapfinding.

Resist Teleportation (Ex): At 2nd level, a portal seeker gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against effects that attempt to magically transport her via a teleportation effect. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, to a maximum bonus of +8 at 20th level. The portal seeker also applies this bonus to saving throws against imprisonment, and she never takes a penalty on her save against this spell as a result of the caster knowing her name and facts about her life.

This replaces poison resistance.

Portal Lore (Ex): At 2nd level, when a portal seeker detects a portal, she can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check (DC = 15 + the portal's caster level, or DC 25 if the caster level isn't specified) to determine the portal's destination plane. If her result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, she also determines the rough location on the destination plane where the portal leads, and if the result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she also determines any command words, portal keys, and other necessary elements needed to open the portal.

This replaces poison lore.

Transit Portals (Su): At 4th level, a portal seeker can create ephemeral portals to improve her maneuverability. At the start of each day, she gains a number of Portal Points equal to her investigator level. She can spend 1 Portal Point as a swift action during a move or withdraw action to open and step through a momentary portal to a location within 20 feet that she can see. Stepping through the portal takes 5 feet of movement, and while the rest of her movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, the extra movement from the portal is a teleportation effect that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

The distance she can travel increases by 10 feet at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum distance of 100 feet at 20th level.

This replaces studied strike.

Extended Portals (Su): At 11th level, a portal seeker can spend 2 Portal Points to create two portals as a standard action, one in an adjacent square and one within 5 feet per investigator level she has in a visible location. These portals persist until the end of her next turn, and creatures of any size can step move through either, using 5 feet of movement to exit from the other portal. At the end of her next turn, she can spend an additional 2 Portal Points as a free action to extend the portals' duration by 1 round.

This replaces poison immunity.
