Secret seekers are trained in the art of extracting answers from intransigent foes. Recognizing that torture is a poor method of securing truthful intelligence, secret seekers instead prefer magical means of inquiry.

Occult Lore (Su): A secret seeker gains access to the prognostication and read aura occult skill unlocks (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 196-197), but not the other occult skill unlocks. If she ever chooses to gain the Psychic Sensitivity feat or otherwise gains access to all occult skill unlocks, she receives Psychic Maestro as a bonus feat, with prognostication and read aura as the two occult skill unlocks selected.

This ability replaces monster lore.

Detect Mind (Sp): At 5th level, a secret seeker can detect anxieties, detect desires, or detect thoughts, as per the spells, for a number of rounds per day equal to twice her inquisitor level. These rounds need not be consecutive. A creature that succeeds at a saving throw against this ability is immune to that secret seeker's detect mind ability for 24 hours. If the secret seeker has the secrets inquisition, she doubles the number of rounds per day that she can use this ability.

At 12th level, a secret seeker can use her detect mind ability for a number of minutes per day equal to twice her inquisitor level, rather than rounds. These minutes need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments. If the secret seeker has the secrets inquisition, she doubles the number of minutes per day she can use this ability.

This ability replaces bane and greater bane.

Seek Mind (Sp): At 14th level, a secret seeker can use her detect mind ability to seek out people with particular anxieties, desires, or thoughts. This functions as per seek thoughts except that it works with any of the three types of mental output the secret seeker can detect with detect mind.

This ability replaces exploit weakness.
