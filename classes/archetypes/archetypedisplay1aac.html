Commando

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 91</a>
Commandos are those rough and ready gunslingers who excel at hit-and-run tactics and leveraging their expertise in the wild against their enemies.

Class Skills: A commando gains Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), and Stealth as class skills instead of Knowledge (engineering), Knowledge (local), and Sleight of Hand.

This alters the gunslinger's class skills.

Deeds: A commando gains the following deeds; each of these deeds replaces an existing deed.

Trap Shot (Ex): At 3rd level, the commando can spend 1 point of grit and target a 5-foot square with her firearm. If she succeeds at an attack against an AC of 10, she triggers a single trap within that 5-foot square, even if she is unaware of the trap. If there are multiple traps within the same 5-foot square, the commando must declare which trap she is triggering; otherwise it is determined randomly. If a creature is occupying the same square as the triggered trap, the trap affects the creature as if it had triggered the trap.

This deed replaces utility shot.

Sniping Shot (Ex): At 11th level, the commando can spend 1 point of grit as a swift action to negate the -20 penalty on Stealth checks when sniping until the start of her next turn.

This deed replaces expert loading.

Camouflage (Ex): At 11th level, as long as the commando has 1 point of grit, she gains the camouflage ranger class feature.

This deed replaces lightning reload.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): At 15th level, as long as the commando has 1 point of grit, she gains the hide in plain sight ranger class feature.

This deed replaces slinger's luck.

Favored Terrain (Ex): At 2nd level, a commando gains the favored terrain ranger class feature. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the commando can pick an additional favored terrain.

This replaces nimble.

Track (Ex): At 4th level, a commando adds half her level on Survival checks to follow tracks. This replaces the bonus feat gained at 4th level.

Trapsmith: At 5th level, a commando can learn how to create one ranger trap in place of gaining the next level of gun training. A commando can use a known trap a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). The DC for a commando's trap is equal to 10 + half her commando level + her Wisdom bonus, and it lasts 1 day per 2 levels she has. A commando can set only extraordinary ranger traps with this ability; as with extraordinary ranger traps, the trap DC for these traps has a -2 penalty.

This alters gun training.
