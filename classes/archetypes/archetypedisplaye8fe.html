A half-orc summoner who devotes himself to one of the bloody orc gods may believe his eidolon is an avatar of that god rather than a mere supernatural creature. A blood god disciple generally fights by the avatar's side and offers it blood sacrifices in exchange for martial prowess. A blood god disciple has the following class features.

Blood Feast (Su):  At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has.

At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer.

This ability replaces the summon monster I, III, V, VII, and IX spell-like abilities.

Bloody Gift (Su):  At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.

Avatar Gambit (Ex):  At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.

Rage Power (Ex):  At 11th level and 15th level, a blood god disciple selects a barbarian rage power, which he may use when raging (whether from the avatar gambit ability or actual barbarian rage). This replaces the summon monster VI and VIII spell-like abilities.
