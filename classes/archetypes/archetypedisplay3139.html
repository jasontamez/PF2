Shepherds of the lakes and seas, aquatic druids guard ecosystems ranging from shallows streams to deep ocean trenches, ministering to their residents and communing with the tides.

Wild Empathy (Ex):  An aquatic druid's wild empathy functions only on creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype; however, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.

Aquatic Adaptation (Ex):  At 2nd level, an aquatic druid gains an insight bonus on Initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, Survival, and Swim checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in aquatic terrain, and she cannot be tracked such environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.

Natural Swimmer (Ex):  At 3rd level, an aquatic druid gains a swim speed equal to half her land speed. This ability replaces trackless step.

Resist Ocean's Fury (Ex):  At 4th level, an aquatic druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells of the water type or the exceptional or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or water subtype. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Wild Shape (Su):  An aquatic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level - 2.

Seaborn (Ex):  At 9th level, an aquatic druid gains the aquatic subtype, the amphibious trait, and a swim speed equal to her land speed. She also can endure cold climate effects as if using endure elements. This ability replaces venom immunity.

Deep Diver (Ex):  At 13th level, an aquatic druid gains DR/slashing or piercing equal to 1/2 her level. This damage reduction also applies against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling or crushing (e.g., black tentacles, crushing hand). She never takes pressure damage from deep water. This ability replaces a thousand faces.
