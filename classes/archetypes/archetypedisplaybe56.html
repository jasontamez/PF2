Galtan agitators fight mightily to cast down the enemies of their ideals within the shambles of the tumultuous nation of Galt. Any rogue (including the rogue from Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained) can select the Galtan agitator archetype.

Reputation (Ex): This ability functions as the renown vigilante social talent (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 12). In addition to improving attitudes, it also improves the Galtan agitator's starting influence (Ultimate Intrigue 102) and reputation with contacts (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 148) in the area by one level or step. For the purpose of vigilante social talents, the Galtan agitator does not have a vigilante identity and is always considered to be in her social identity, unless she has another identity (such as from the vigilante class). If the Galtan agitator has another identity, she does not gain any benefits from renown while in that identity unless she has the renown social talent or a similar ability.

This ability replaces trapfinding.

Ready for Betrayal (Ex): At 3rd level, a Galtan agitator gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to recognize disguises and notice hiding creatures and on Sense Motive checks to disbelieve lies. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 rogue levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).

This ability replaces trap sense.

Enthralling Agitation (Su): At 4th level, a Galtan agitator can captivate a crowd once per day, as per the spell enthrall. (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Galtan agitator's rogue level + her Charisma modifier). During the spell's effect, the Galtan agitator can attempt a DC 15 Charisma check to increase her individual or organizational influence with the members of the crowd by 1 rank or step. Or, if the crowd members' attitudes toward the Galtan agitator are indifferent or worse, this check can improve their attitudes by 1 step. The Galtan agitator can never use this ability to increase her individual or organization influence or improve the crowd's attitude by more than 2 ranks or steps.

This replaces the rogue talent gained at 4th level.

Revolutionary's Cause (Su): At 8th level, the Galtan agitator can lift an enthralled crowd's emotions and turn them toward a common purpose. As a standard action after she has used her enthralling agitation- but before the enthrall effect wears off'she can target the affected creatures with a plausible suggestion (DC = 10 + 1/2 her rogue level + her Charisma modifier). that has a duration of up to 1 day.

This ability replaces the rogue talent gained at 8th level.

Leadership (Ex): At 12th level, a Galtan agitator gains Leadership as a bonus feat. If the Galtan agitator already has the Leadership feat, she doubles her Charisma modifier when calculating her base Leadership score.

This replaces the rogue talent gained at 12th level.
