The haunted are a dangerous breed of spellcasters bound to temperamental and unpredictable phantoms that leech power from their spiritualists.

Usurp Manifestation (Su):  At 3rd level, the haunted's phantom begins to subtly subvert the relationship with its master, gaining rather than granting power from the connection. When fully manifested in ectoplasmic form, the phantom can use its usurp manifestation ability to draw upon the haunted's body to strengthen its ectoplasmic might, temporarily weakening the spiritualist in order to increase its own power. The phantom must activate this ability as an immediate action at the start of the spiritualist's turn, and it can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + the haunted's spiritualist level. The rounds don't need to be consecutive, and the phantom can dismiss the effects of a usurped manifestation as a free action on its turn. While this ability is in effect, the haunted's features become sunken and withdrawn, and she gains the nauseated condition until the effect ends. Conversely, the phantom surges in size and power, becoming one size category larger (as if affected by an enlarge person spell) and increasing its natural armor bonus to AC by 2 for the effect's duration. If the spiritualist prevents or mitigates the nauseated condition, the phantom is unable to siphon energy and doesn't gain the benefits of usurp manifestation.

At 8th level and every 5 levels thereafter (13th and 18th levels), the phantom gains new abilities while using usurp manifestation.

Usurp Spell: At 8th level, while using usurp manifestation, the phantom can leech spell slots from the haunted to increase its own power. The phantom can reach through the etheric tether as a swift action to drain the nauseated haunted's psychic spell energy, effectively taking any touch spell or spell with a target of "you" that the haunted knows and casting it on itself (assuming the haunted has not yet used up her allotment of spells per day for the spell's level). This ability consumes two of the haunted's spell slots of the appropriate level and otherwise follows the rules for the share spells and deliver touch spells abilities.

Teleplasmic Surge: At 13th level, when using usurp manifestation, the phantom gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

Ferocious Phantom: At 18th level, when using usurp manifestation the phantom gains DR 10/slashing and spell resistance equal to 11 + the haunted's spiritualist level (this spell resistance doesn't apply to spells originating from the spiritualist or from the usurp spell ability).

This ability replaces bonded manifestation.

Usurped Bond (Su):  At 17th level, the haunted's phantom can use usurp manifestation for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + double the haunted's spiritualist level. This ability replaces dual bond.
