Spell trappers are found in lands where hunting and magic are abundant, particularly the deserts of Thuvia and the harsh lands of Geb and Nex. They forsake much of their arcane skill and martial knowledge in exchange for the ability to conjure magical traps to hinder their foes.

Class Skills: A spell trapper adds Disable Device to his list of class skills in place of Knowledge (planes).

This alters the magus's class skills.

Diminished Arcana: A spell trapper treats his effective magus level as 3 lower when determining which arcana he can select. A spell trapper can choose to learn a new trap (see Spell Traps below) in place of learning a new magus arcana.

This modifies the magus arcana ability.

Spell Traps (Sp): At 4th level, a spell trapper learns how to craft magical traps in exchange for the use of spell slots. These traps work as ranger traps (Ultimate Magic 64), except they always count as spell-like abilities. A spell trap is always considered magical, and is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to 1/3 the spell trapper's class level. A magical trap lasts only 1 hour per level or until triggered, whichever comes first. A trap's DC decreases by 1 for each full hour that passes after it is set. Upon gaining this ability, the spell trapper automatically knows the snare trap.

Setting a spell trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If attacked during the course of conjuring a trap, the spell trapper must attempt a concentration check, as though damaged while casting a spell. A trap fills a single 5-foot square, and cannot be placed in the same area as another spell trapper trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding. Spell trappers need access to a material component pouch to craft spell traps (unless they have the Eschew Materials feat) and must sacrifice a spell slot to create the trap. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and saving throws to avoid it are equal to 10 + 1/2 the spell trapper's magus level + the spell slot level sacrificed to create the trap. All spell traps are Trigger location, and Reset none.

This ability replaces spell recall.

Distant Trapping (Sp): At 10th level, a spell trapper can create spell traps at a distance. She can create her traps at close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

This replaces the fighter training ability.
