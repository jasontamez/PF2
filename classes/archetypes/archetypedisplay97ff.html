Practicing magic in secret, the warlock obscures her arcane scholarship from public view. Her study of these arts allows her to hide her dual nature and enchant her enemies-or simply blast them with furious magical attacks.

Class Skills: The warlock adds Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft to her list of class skills, instead of Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), Perception, and Survival.

This alters the vigilante's class skills.

Skill Ranks per Level: The warlock gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + her Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of 6 + her Intelligence modifier skill ranks.

This alters the vigilante's skill ranks per level.

Armor Proficiencies: A warlock is not proficient with medium armor. Like a magus, she can cast her spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.

This alters the vigilante's armor proficiencies.

Spellcasting: A warlock casts arcane spells and cantrips as a magus. She prepares spells using a spellbook, choosing them from the 6th-level and lower spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list; higher-level sorcerer/wizard spells are not on the warlock's spell list.

This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.

Spellbook: A warlock has a spellbook that functions in the same way as a magus's spellbook but uses the 6th-level and lower spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.

Mystic Bolts (Su): A warlock can sling projectiles of magical energy at will by shooting a bolt or touching her foe. A melee mystic bolt requires the target to be within reach, and a ranged mystic bolt is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet. A mystic bolt deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 for every 4 vigilante levels the warlock has. The warlock must choose one type of damage for her mystic bolt: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Attacking with a mystic bolt takes the place of one of the warlock's normal attacks, and she can make a full attack using mystic bolts. The warlock vigilante attacks with mystic bolts as though they were light one-handed weapons, and the bolts can be used for two-weapon fighting (with each hand creating one mystic bolt) and feats and abilities that apply to weapon attacks (unless they're excluded from that feat, such as with Power Attack). Weapon Focus (ray) doesn't apply to mystic bolts, but a warlock can take Weapon Focus (mystic bolt) and apply it to both melee and ranged mystic bolts.

Creating a mystic bolt requires the hand to be free, but the bolt appears only briefly, so a warlock using mystic bolts has a free hand any time she isn't attacking with a mystic bolt. The warlock threatens with a mystic bolt, but only if she has a hand free. Because mystic bolts are impermanent, a spell that targets a single weapon (like magic weapon) can't affect it, nor can a mystic bolt be made with magic weapon special abilities. Abilities that affect all weapon attacks the warlock makes, such as the arcane striker warlock talent, function with mystic bolts.

At 7th level and every 6 vigilante levels thereafter, the warlock chooses another damage type from the list above. Each time she creates a mystic bolt, she can have it use any one of the damage types she has selected.

This ability replaces vigilante specialization.

Piercing Bolts (Ex): At 3rd level, the warlock can choose one mystic bolt per round to be a touch attack. This turns a melee mystic bolt into a melee touch attack or a ranged mystic bolt into a ranged touch attack. At 5th level, the warlock can treat all of her mystic bolts as touch attacks.

This ability replaces unshakable.

Warlock Talents: A warlock can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents.

This alters vigilante talents.

Arcane Striker (Su): The warlock gains Arcane Strike as a bonus feat. At 12th level, when she activates Arcane Strike, she can choose to also give her weapons the flaming, frost, shock, or thundering weapon special ability. She makes this choice each time she activates Arcane Strike, and it lasts for the same duration. At 16th level, she adds anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst, and unholy to the list of special abilities she can select. She can choose to apply an alignment-based weapon special ability only while in her vigilante identity, and only if it matches the alignment of her vigilante identity.

Elemental Armor (Su): When in her vigilante identity, the warlock gains armor made of elemental energy. She is surrounded by a nimbus of ice, lightning, or flames, granting her resistance 5 to cold, electricity, or fire, respectively. The damage type must be chosen when she selects this talent, and it can't be changed. At 4th level, the warlock's armor deals 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type to any creature striking the warlock with a natural weapon or a non-reach melee weapon. A creature that attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against the warlock also takes this damage. A creature can take damage in this way no more than once per round. At 8th level, the energy resistance increases to 10. At 12th level, the damage increases to 2d6 points. At 16th level, the warlock becomes immune to the chosen damage type while in her vigilante identity.

Familiar (Ex): The warlock gains a familiar, using her vigilante level as her effective wizard level. The familiar also has a social identity as a seemingly normal animal, though warlocks with outlandish familiars might still need to hide them.

Social Simulacrum (Sp): The warlock can create a shortlived simulacrum (as lesser simulacrum on page 238 of Ultimate Magic) that duplicates her social identity, allowing her to appear to be in two places at once. Creating the duplicate takes 1 hour and requires no material component cost. It lasts for 4 hours before turning back into an inert pile of snow. The duplicate replicates only the warlock's social identity, with the same alignment and social talents. It has no magical abilities, and can't assume a vigilante identity. As with the spell, the simulacrum isn't under the warlock's control. The warlock can create a social simulacrum no more than once per day and can have only one in existence at a time. A warlock must be at least 8th level to select this talent.

Tattoo Chamber (Su): This talent functions as the cabalist ability of the same name.
