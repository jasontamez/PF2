The blood of dragons not only flows through a dragon
drinker's veins, but also empowers her spells and
magical abilities when consumed. Dragon drinkers have
the following class features.

Bloodline: A dragon drinker must belong to the
draconic bloodline.

Bleeding Spells (Su): Whenever a dragon drinker casts
a spell that deals damage, the spell deals 1 point of bleed
damage per spell level to any creatures of the dragon
type damaged. This ability replaces the bloodline
arcana ability.

Blood Drinking (Su): Starting at first level, a dragon
drinker gains the ability to drink dragon blood to alter
or augment her spellcasting abilities. See page 18 for
information on dragon's blood. For the purposes of
harvesting dragon's blood, treat the dragon drinker
as though she has Dragoncrafting feat. At 5th level,
drinking a vial of dragon's blood is a standard action
that provides the dragon drinker with the normal
benef its of the item, as well as a +1 bonus to her caster
level for purposes of level-dependent spell effects
on a single spell cast within 1 minute. At 7th level, a
consumed vial of dragon blood also heals 1d8 points of
damage instead of the standard 1d4. At 11th level, the
alchemical bonus on Fortitude and Ref lex saves granted
by the blood increases to +2.

In the absence of true dragon's blood, the dragon
drinker may tap into the draconic blood flowing
through her veins to gain the temporary effects of having
consumed dragon's blood. As a free action, she can
activate this ability, healing 1d4 points of damage and
gaining a +1 resistance bonus on Will and Fortitude saves
for 1 round. This action may only be performed once per
round, and can be performed a number of times per day
equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces
the claws bloodline power.

Energy Assimilation (Su): At 7th level, when the dragon
drinker drinks true dragon's blood from a dragon with
a breath weapon that deals a different type of energy
damage than her chosen energy type, she may adopt the
energy resistance of the blood's source dragon as if it were
her selected bloodline. This effect lasts for 1 minute per
dose of dragon's blood, after which the dragon drinker's
energy resistance reverts back to her normal energy type.
This ability replaces the 7th-level bloodline feat.

Breath Mimicry (Su): At 13th level, when the dragon
drinker drinks true dragon's blood from a dragon with
a breath weapon of a shape or energy type different from
her own, she may use the shape and energy type of the
blood's source dragon when she next uses her breath
weapon. This ability replaces the 13th-level bloodline feat.

Blood Siphon (Su): At 19th level, when the dragon
drinker is within 60 feet of a creature of the dragon
type that is suffering bleed damage, she can, as a swift
action, draw a dose of its blood into herself as though
she had consumed it from a vial. Additionally, when she
consumes dragon's blood, it heals 3d8 points of damage
and provides a +3 resistance bonus on Fortitude and Will
saves for 1 minute in place of its normal effects. This
ability replaces the 19th-level bloodline feat.
