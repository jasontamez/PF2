Malice Binder

A lock of hair, a bit of blood, even a footprint is enough to grant a wily witch hunter an edge. Malice binders often rise from the ranks of the common folk rather than from wealthy nobles or the church. Their magic is old and crude, but devastatingly effective against those they hunt.

Witch Lore (Ex):  Malice binders hunt and kill those who would plague the world with supernatural power. A malice binder can use inspiration on Knowledge (arcana), Spellcraft, Sleight of Hand, and Survival checks without expending a use of inspiration, provided he is trained in the skill, rather than on any Knowledge and Linguistics checks. He can later spend an investigator talent to gain the ability to use inspiration on any Knowledge and Linguistics checks.

This alters inspiration.

Take a Bit (Ex):  The malice binder gains Improved Steal as a bonus feat at 1st level. At 3rd level, he can use inspiration to improve a steal combat maneuver check by spending one use of inspiration rather than two.

This replaces trapfinding and trap sense.

Fettering (Su):  A malice binder forgoes alchemy for the study of sympathetic magic that allows him to hinder foes. Fetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities) which saturates even their hair and clothing. Fetters cannot target a creature with no magical ability. The malice binder knows one fetter at 1st level and gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

Every fetter requires a token taken from his desired target: a few hairs, a lost tooth, nail clippings, a scrap of clothing, or a small treasured possession with some significance. An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: a successful Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature's CR) to search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours. Malice binders can search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities; they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and a malice binder can maintain one prepared token per class level. Each token can be used only to power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift action.

The DC to resist a fetter is equal to 10 + half the investigator's class level + the investigator's Charisma bonus. Activating a fetter is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and unless otherwise stated the target must be within 30 feet, plus 5 feet per 2 levels. Once a creature has been the target of a specific fetter, it is immune to that effect for 24 hours.

This replaces alchemy.

Divine Dread (Su): Binding a token to a holy symbol anathema to the target fills the creature with supernatural dread, imposing the shaken condition for 1 round per class level. At 6th level, the target is frightened instead. At 11th level, the target becomes panicked instead. On a successful Will saving throw, the target is instead shaken for a single round.

Hexing Shield (Su): By placing a token between two shiny copper coins and then putting them in a creature's mouth, the malice binder can ward himself or others. This fetter grants whoever holds it in his mouth a +2 resistance bonus on Will saving throws against the target's spells, supernatural abilities, and spell-like abilities. The fetter lasts 10 minutes per class level, but whoever holds it in his mouth cannot eat, drink, speak, or cast spells with verbal components without ending the effect early. At 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the resistance bonus granted improves by 1, to a maximum of +8 at 19th level. The malice binder can have only one hexing shield active at a time.

Incapacitate (Su): By rubbing soot into a token, the malice binder clouds his target's senses or stifles the target's tongue. This fetter deafens or silences the target for 1 round per 2 class levels (minimum 1 round). Silenced creatures cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components, but they are otherwise unrestricted from making sounds. At 6th level, a malice binder can either blind his target or both silence and deafen it. On a successful Will saving throw, the target is instead dazzled for a single round.

Repulse (Su): By binding a token to a bit of rancid meat, the malice binder can impede his target's approach. Once activated, this fetter forces its target to spend twice the normal amount of movement to approach the fetter while within range of its effect; it does not affect the target's ability to move away. At 11th level, the fetter's target cannot physically approach within 10 feet of the fetter, as if affected by a repulsion spell. This fetter remains active for 1 minute per class level and can be handed to another creature or left somewhere to ward against a witch's entry. A target can overcome this effect with a successful Will saving throw when the fetter is first activated.

Salting Wounds (Su): The malice binder can rub salt into a wound-his own or that of an adjacent ally-treating the wound as a token to protect the injured creature from the danger that threatens it. This fetter grants a +2 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from the creature that caused the original wound, which is treated as the fetter's target for the purposes of how often it can be used. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the deflection bonus to AC increases by 1, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. This fetter is painful to whom it protects, sickening the protected creature while the fetter remains in effect.

Shackle (Su): Binding a token to manacles or a length of rope causes the restraints to fly out and entangle the target. A target can avoid this fetter with a successful Reflex save. An entangled target can attempt to escape as a standard action with either an Escape Artist check or a combat maneuver check using the same DC as the initial saving throw. Using masterwork manacles in this fetter increases the escape DC by 2.

Temptation (Su): Anointing a token with incense or scented oils creates a supernaturally appealing object to attract a target's attention. Once activated, this fetter lasts for 1 minute per class level. If the target approaches within the fetter's area of effect, it is compelled to approach the fetter and pick it up; the compulsion can be negated with a successful Will save. This effect ends immediately if the target picks up the fetter or the fetter moves more than 30 feet plus 5 feet per 2 levels away from the target. At 11th level, the fetter fascinates its target once picked up, affecting it as if by the spell hypnotism for 1 round per class level; this fetter is not limited by the target's Hit Dice.

Witch Compass (Su): Placing a token on top of a compass causes the needle to point toward the malice binder's target for 1 hour per class level, granting a +10 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to track that creature. The target must be within 1 mile per class level, or else the needle spins aimlessly.

Wrack (Su): The binder can drive an iron nail through a token to leave his target sickened with pain until the end of the malice binder's next turn. At 6th level, the target is instead staggered until the end of the malice binder's next turn. The target can negate this fetter with a successful Fortitude save. For this fetter, a binder can use a clear footprint as a token; finding an appropriate footprint requires a successful Survival skill check to track the target.

Take a Bit More (Ex):  At 8th level, taking a bit of clothing or hair to use as a token becomes second nature for the malice binder. He gains Quick Steal as a bonus feat. When attempting to steal a token, he gains a +2 competence bonus on combat maneuver checks.

This replaces poison resistance.

Witch Trapper (Ex):  Beginning at 11th level, whenever the malice binder would gain a fetter, he can instead select a ranger trap (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 64), treating his investigator level as his ranger level for the purpose of determining the trap's effect.

This replaces poison immunity.
