Whether as spymasters, extortionists, political fixers, or puppet masters, secret brokers use their talents with objects to gain information, then leverage that information for their own purposes.

Class Skills: A secret broker adds Bluff and all remaining Knowledge skills to her list of class skills.

This alters the occultist's class skills.

Knowledge Is Power: The secret broker starts play possessing a single divination implement, typically a ledger of secrets. She gains new implements as normal at 2nd level and every 4 levels thereafter, and they can be of any school. A secret broker's third eye resonant power grants an insight bonus on Profession and Sense Motive checks equal to the bonus it grants on Perception checks, and an insight bonus on all Knowledge checks equal to half that bonus. She must select divination with implement mastery.

This ability alters implements and implement mastery.

Broker Secrets (Su): At 2nd level, a secret broker can trade her secrets to another. For the purpose of this ability, an object's secret is composed of pieces of information gained from a single object through object reading, object seer, psychometry, or read object that the occultist didn't otherwise know and hasn't shared with another, written somewhere, or otherwise recorded or found a way to recover should she forget them and lose possession of the object. The secret broker can willingly use this ability in tandem with handing the object over to another creature in order to transfer the object's secret to that creature. The secret broker forgets the object's secret and the creature instantly learns the object's secret.

The secret broker can also destroy an object to remove his memory of the object's secret without transferring it to another. In either case, any onlookers who understand what the secret broker is doing, and the recipient in the case of a transfer, can intrinsically tell that the secret broker has used this ability rather than simply sharing the memory through other means or destroying the object but keeping its secret.

This ability replaces magic item skill.

Share Memory (Sp): At 4th level, a secret broker learns to use her knowledge transference powers more flexibly, allowing her to use share memory at will, but only with willing targets.

This ability replaces shift focus.

Steal Secret (Sp): At 8th level, a secret broker learns how to steal a secret from an unwilling target. This works as her share memory ability, except it allows her to access memories from unwilling targets. A target that succeeds at its saving throw against a secret broker's steal secret ability is forever after immune to that secret broker's steal secret ability.

This ability replaces magic circles.

Erase Secret (Sp): At 12th level, a secret broker can expend 1 point of mental focus from her divination implement in order to erase a fact from someone's mind by touch. This works similarly to modify memory to erase the memory of an event, except the effect is instantaneous and leaves no magical trace (it can still be removed by break enchantment, psychic surgery, limited wish, miracle, or wish) and the secret broker can remove only one fact, such as "The queen and the general are having an affair" rather than a 5-minute event. Erasing the memory of a fact does not prevent the target from learning the fact again, or even potentially from deducing the fact again from evidence, given time.

This ability replaces binding circles.

Purge Secret (Sp): At 16th level, a secret broker can expend 3 points of mental focus from her divination implement to apply her erase secret ability to up to one creature per level within 30 feet of her.

This ability replaces fast circles.
