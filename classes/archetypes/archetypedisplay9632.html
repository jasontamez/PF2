Beastblade magi work in tandem with their familiars, using spell, steel, and claw to clear the battlefield of foes.

Familiar (Ex):  At 3rd level, the beastblade gains the familiar magus arcana. This ability replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd level.

Tandem Touch (Su):  At 4th level, while the beastblade's familiar is holding the charge for a touch spell, the beastblade can cast another spell without discharging the familiar's held charge. This ability replaces spell recall.

Familiar Pool (Su):  At 7th level, when a beastblade prepares his magus spells, he can expend points from his arcane pool (up to a maximum number of points equal to his Intelligence modifier) to empower his familiar. For each point expended in this way, the familiar can cast one magus spell as a spelllike ability once that day. Each spell selected must be 3 spell levels lower than the highest spell level the beastblade can cast, and can't require a material component that costs more than 1 gp. This ability replaces knowledge pool.

Familiar Spellstrike (Su):  At 11th level, whenever a beastblade's familiar successfully delivers a touch spell against a creature the magus threatens, the target provokes an attack of opportunity from the magus. This ability replaces improved spell recall.
