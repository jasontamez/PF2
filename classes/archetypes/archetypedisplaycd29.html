Among the greatest technologies to come from Azlant are ioun stones, small crystalline minerals imbued with magical energies that modern scholars still struggle to dissect. Some kineticists dedicate themselves to unlocking ioun stones' cosmic secrets and seemingly limitless potential.

Ioun Focus: An ioun kineticist must choose aether as her elemental focus. She cannot select disintegrating infusion, foe throw, or force hook as infusions, nor can she select aether puppet, telekinetic finesse, telekinetic haul, or telekinetic invisibility as wild talents. She instead treats the following infusions and wild talents as though they were part of the aether element cyclone, fragmentation, jagged flesh, and rare metal infusion. These infusions can be applied to the ioun kineticist's telekinetic blast and Azlanti composite blast (see below).

An ioun kineticist's telekinetic blast always sends one or more of her ioun stones to strike her foes and immediately return, and her wild talents typically manifest as her ioun stones moving or spinning to create fields of energy.

This alters elemental focus.

Ioun Cloud (Su): An ioun kineticist forms a powerful bond with three dull gray ioun stones, referred to as her ioun cloud. She begins play with these stones at no cost, and she gains a bond with an additional free dull gray ioun stone at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. She also increases the AC of stones in her ioun cloud by an amount equal to her class level, and she increases the hardness of these stones by an amount equal to half her class level (minimum +0). An ioun kineticist cannot use her gather power, ioun buffer, kinetic blast, or personal resonance class abilities unless she has at least one bonded ioun stone orbiting her. She takes a cumulative -2 penalty on concentration checks for each bonded ioun stone less than her possible maximum in her current ioun cloud. When she uses her gather power class ability, her ioun cloud buzzes, glows, spins rapidly, and traces eldritch symbols in the air.

While the ioun kineticist can own additional ioun stones outside of this bond, only bonded ioun stones can be a part of her ioun cloud. An ioun kineticist can spend 1 hour meditating with an ioun stone to bond with it and add it to her ioun cloud, but doing so immediately unbonds and removes one ioun stone of her choice from her ioun cloud unless she is replacing an ioun stone that has been lost or destroyed.

Basic Iounkinesis (Su or Sp): An ioun kineticist can manipulate ioun stones with ease and channel their magical fields to create simple effects. She can activate (making the stones orbit her) or stow a number of ioun stones equal to her class level in any combination as a move action, and she can activate or stow twice as many as a standard action. She can affect only ioun stones orbiting her and unattended ioun stones within 15 feet with this ability. This ability also allows her to cast prestidigitation at will as a spell-like ability.

This replaces the basic telekinesis utility wild talent granted by the aether element.

Ioun Buffer (Su): An ioun kineticist can store excess energy in her ioun cloud. This functions as the kineticist's internal buffer ability, except she stores each point of burn within a different ioun stone in her ioun cloud. She can access the burn stored in an ioun stone only if it is orbiting her. When expending an ioun stone's stored point of burn to reduce the cost of a blast wild talent, the ioun kineticist can expend all of that ioun stone's energy, permanently transforming it into a dull gray ioun stone. If the ioun stone's market price was at least 4,000 gp, this effect further reduces the burn cost of that wild talent by 2. If the ioun stone's market price was at least 10,000 gp, it instead further reduces the burn cost by 3. If the ioun stone's market price was more than 20,000 gp, it instead further reduces the burn cost by 4.

This alters internal buffer.

Personal Resonance (Su): At 6th level, an ioun kineticist can harmonize her body's energies with that of her ioun cloud. Whenever she has at least 3 points of burn, she gains the resonant powers of two ioun stones of her choice in her ioun cloud; she is treated as holding a wayfinder for the purpose of using any resonant powers. As a standard action, she can switch which two ioun stones are granting their resonance powers. At 11th level, whenever she has at least 5 points of burn, she can gain the resonance powers of up to four ioun stones in her ioun cloud. At 16th level, whenever she has at least 7 points of burn, she gains the resonance powers of all of the ioun stones in her ioun cloud.

In place of gaining the resonant power of a deep rose sphere, incandescent blue sphere, pale blue rhomboid, pink and green sphere, pink rhomboid, or scarlet and blue sphere, the ioun kineticist can instead increase the enhancement bonus it grants to an ability score to +4. This bonus increases to +5 at 11th level when she has at least 5 point of burn and increases to +6 at 16th level when she has at least 7 points of burn. An ioun kineticist can increase only one ioun stone's enhancement bonus in this way at a time.

This replaces the ability score boosts granted by elemental overflow.

Azlanti Blast (Su): An ioun kineticist who selects aether as her expanded element does not gain the force composite blast. She instead gains the Azlanti composite blast, which costs 2 points of burn. An Azlanti blast is a physical blast that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.
