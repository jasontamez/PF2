While most kineticists channel elemental power through their bodies, rare kineticists, such as elemental ascetics, overwhelming souls, and psychokineticists channel such power through their minds. Psychokineticists lack an overwhelming soul's strong spirit, and so this energy ravages their minds but unleashes power locked in their ruptured emotions. Sometimes a psychokineticist inadvertently unleashes his power when he experiences an outburst of strong emotion, potentially making a psychokineticist an outcast or even an accidental killer.

Emotional Intensity (Ex): A psychokineticist uses his Wisdom modifier instead of his Constitution modifier to determine his damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitution-based wild talents, the durations of wild talents with Constitution-based durations, his bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and other Constitution-based effects of all his wild talents. He can't use any of his wild talents whenever he would be unable to use a spell with an emotion component (see page 144 of Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures), and if he ever gains immunity to charm, compulsion, emotion effects (even if such immunity extends only to a subcategory of these effects like fear effects or compulsion effects from creatures of certain alignments), he loses all his kineticist abilities. This includes effects that he previously activated that normally last until the next time his burn is removed, like elemental defenses, though he still keeps all his penalties from burn. He can always choose to ignore such immunities when he would normally gain them, even if they are granted by another class feature (such as the paladin's aura of courage), but once he decides whether or not to ignore an immunity he would have gained, the choice cannot be changed.A psychokineticist adds Sense Motive to his list of class skills and gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat.

This ability alters the kineticist's class skills and the key ability score of wild talents.

Mind Burn (Ex): A psychokineticist's mind strains when he overtaxes himself. He takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, Wisdom checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for each point of burn he has accepted, rather than taking nonlethal damage from burn. He can accept an amount of burn equal to his Wisdom modifier (rather than 3 + his Wisdom modifier). Otherwise, his burn works just like a normal kineticist's.

This ability alters burn.

Mental Overflow (Ex): A psychokineticist's elemental energy sends strange elemental humors and planar echoes through his brain instead of reshaping his body with matter from his element. Instead of gaining size bonuses to physical ability scores from elemental overflow, he gains alchemical bonuses to his mental ability scores in equal amounts (a +2 alchemical bonus to two mental ability scores at 6th level if he has at least 3 points of burn; a +4 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score and a +2 alchemical bonus to the other two at 11th level if he has at least 5 points of burn; and a +6 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score, a +4 alchemical bonus to another, and a +2 alchemical bonus to the last at 16th level if he has at least 7 points of burn). A psychokineticist doesn't gain a chance to negate critical hits and sneak attacks based on his burn. Otherwise, his elemental overflow works just like a normal kineticist's.
