Some familiars are messengers of greater powers than themselves. The witch's familiar comes from her patron and the emissary is the servant of a god, but the occult messenger is envoy of an odder power still.

See the Unseen (Ex): While an occult messenger is within arm's reach, the master gains the <a href="featdisplayfc3c.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Sensitivity">Psychic Sensitivity</a> feat.

This replaces Alertness.

Teacher from Afar (Ex): When the occult messenger's master uses a <a href="rules79d0.html?Name=Occult%20Skill%20Unlocks&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">psychic skill unlock</a> while the occult messenger is within arm's reach, the master gains a competence bonus on skill unlocks equal to half the occult messenger's level.

This replaces deliver touch spells.
