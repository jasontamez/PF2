Dedicated followers of Erastil become closer to their god by mastering archery and caring for each other. They can tap into the power of the Elk Father, who guides and empowers their arrows.

Requirements: To qualify to become a Deadeye devotee, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

Alignment: Lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good.
Deity: Must worship <a href="deitydisplay8303.html?ItemName=Erastil">Erastil</a>.
Base Attack Bonus: +6.
Feats: <a href="featdisplaycc4c.html?ItemName=Point%20Blank%20Shot"></a>, <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplaycbc0.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus%20(longbow)">Weapon Focus (longbow)</a>.
Spells: Must be able to cast 1st-level divine spells.

This alters requirements.

Spells per Day: At the indicated levels, a Deadeye devotee gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a Deadeye devotee, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

This alters spells per day.

Energy Arrow (Su): At 4th level, when casting either a <a href="spelldisplaye3d6.html?ItemName=cure%20light%20wounds">cure</a> or <a href="spelldisplaybdff.html?ItemName=inflict%20light%20wounds">inflict</a> spell, a deadeye devotee can create an arrow composed of positive or negative energy. This ability allows the devotee to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range to make a ranged touch attack. The physical damage that would be dealt from a mundane arrow is converted into additional damage to the inflict spell or into additional healing for a cure spell. A spell cast in this way is a standard action and the deadeye devotee can fire the arrow as part of the casting. If the arrow misses, the spell is wasted.

This replaces seeker arrow.
