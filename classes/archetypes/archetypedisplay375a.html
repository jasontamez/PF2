Herald Caller

Unlike warpriests or paladins, who charge headlong into battle in the name of their patron deities, herald callers are adept at calling powerful outsiders to aid their brethren in battle.

Skill Ranks per Level:  4 + Int modifier. This alters the cleric's class skills.

Dedicated Summoner:  A herald caller depends on summoned allies to overcome her foes, which affords her little experience with the martial pursuits typical of other clerics and a narrower spiritual focus. A herald caller can choose only one domain from her deity's list of domains, rather than the normal two domains, and she doesn't gain proficiency with medium armor or shields. This ability alters the cleric's domains and armor proficiencies.

Call Heralds (Su):  A herald caller can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can lose a prepared spell in order to cast any summon monster spell of the same level or lower. She gains a +1 bonus on concentration checks to cast a summon monster spell defensively. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level, and increases by 1 every 5 cleric levels thereafter.

Divine Heralds (Su):  A herald caller can use summon monster spells only to summon creatures particularly appropriate to her deity. This includes all creatures listed as summon monster options for priests of her deity (see Expanded Summoning for Priests on page 30), creatures whose alignment matches at least one aspect of her deity's alignment, and creatures of an elemental subtype that matches a domain granted by the deity (if any). When summoning a creature that is normally summoned with the celestial or fiendish template, a herald caller of a chaotic deity can instead summon it with the entropic template, and a herald caller of a lawful deity can instead summon it with the resolute template (see pages 292-293 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 for more information on these simple templates).

Because of these summoned monsters' strong ties to the herald caller's deity, the herald caller also gains specific benefits with creatures she summons with summon monster spells gained from her cleric spell list. The herald caller and her summoned monsters can understand each other's spoken words as if they shared a common language (though this doesn't give summoned monsters the ability to speak if they normally lack it). Whenever the herald caller uses channel energy to heal, she can include all of her summoned monsters, even if they are out of her normal channel energy radius or of a creature type that would not normally be affected. If she channels energy to deal damage, she can exclude any of her summoned monsters that would normally be affected.

Mighty Heralds:  At 4th level, a herald caller receives Augment Summoning as a bonus feat, and is considered to have Spell Focus (conjuration) for the purposes of prerequisites for feats that have Augment Summoning as a prerequisite (such as Evolved Summoned Monster on page 146 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide). At 8th level, she gains Superior Summoning (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 157) as a bonus feat.
