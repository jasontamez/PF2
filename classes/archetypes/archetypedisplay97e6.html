Studious librarians are bards that have studied long in great libraries of the Inner Sea region, such as Taldor's Kitharodian Academy in Oppara, Forae Logos and the Pathfinder Society's Skyreach in Absalom, and the Grand Library of Eto in Osirion.

Scribe Scroll: A studious librarian gains <FEATS%Scribe Scroll">Scribe Scroll</a> as a bonus feat.

This ability replaces distraction.

Comparative Arcane Studies (Su): At 6th level, the studious librarian is exposed to a wide variety of magical writing, and can use his own magic to duplicate spells from other classes' spell lists. Once per day, a studious librarian can cast any spell from the <a href="spells190c.html?Class=Bard">bard</a>, <a href="spells8ce5.html?Class=Wizard">sorcerer/wizard</a>, or <a href="spellsfbfa.html?Class=Witch">witch</a> spell lists from a scroll or spellbook in hand as if it were one of his bard spells known, expending a bard spell slot of the same spell level to cast the desired spell. Casting a spell from a scroll this way does not cause the spell to vanish from the scroll. A spell cast in this way cannot be modified by metamagic. The studious librarian gains one additional daily use of this ability at 10th level and again every 4 bard levels thereafter, to a maximum of four times per day at 18th level.

This ability replaces suggestion and jack-of-all-trades.

Critical Research Focus (Ex): At 8th level, the studious librarian threatens a critical hit on a Research check (Ultimate Intrigue 148) with a roll of 18, 19, or 20. He gains a +4 bonus on Research checks to confirm a critical hit.

This ability replaces dirge of doom.

Perfect Recollection (Ex): At 19th level, the studious librarian can always take 20 on Knowledge checks.

This ability replaces mass suggestion.

One with the Library (Ex): At 20th level, the studious librarian can replace one of her spells known with any bard spell from a scroll once per day by studying the scroll for 1 hour. Doing so erases the spell from the scroll.

This ability replaces deadly performance.
