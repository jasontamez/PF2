These rangers specialize in surviving hostile subterranean environs. They are well equipped to avoid traps, spot secret passages, and deal with inimical dungeon tenants.

Class Skills:  A dungeon rover gains Disable Device and Knowledge (engineering) as class skills and loses Ride as a class skill.

Stone Scouting (Ex):  A dungeon rover gains a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice underground environmental hazards, including traps, potential cave-ins, and dangerous flora. A dungeon rover receives a check to notice these hazards whenever he passes within 10 feet of them, whether or not he is actively looking. This ability replaces track.

Vermin Affinity (Ex):  A dungeon rover gains the ability to improve the attitude of mindless subterranean creatures. This ability functions as the wild empathy class feature, except a dungeon rover can influence any vermin (even those without Intelligence scores) instead of animals. Additionally, a dungeon rover can influence oozes with a -4 penalty on his vermin affinity check. This ability replaces wild empathy.

Dungeon Ally (Ex):  At 4th level, a dungeon rover may select a giant slug, a giant centipede, a goblin dog, a giant scorpion, or any poisonous snake as his animal companion, in addition to the usual animal companion options available to rangers with the hunter's bond class feature. This ability modifies hunter's bond.

Subterranean Stride (Ex):  At 7th level, a dungeon rover is never slowed by difficult terrain while underground. However, areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him. This ability replaces woodland stride.

Improved Stone Scouting (Ex):  At 8th level, a dungeon rover's bonus on Perception checks to notice underground environmental hazards increases to +4. Additionally, the rover receives a check to notice these irregularities whenever he passes within 15 feet of them. This ability replaces swift tracker.
