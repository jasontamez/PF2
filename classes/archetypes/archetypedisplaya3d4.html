The cavaliers known as knights of Arnisant revere the famous general who was crucial in the defeat of the Whispering Tyrant, the powerful wizard-king. Knights of Arnisant call upon Arnisant to grant them protection from evil magic, just as the Shield of Aroden protected him. Many of these cavaliers further emulate him by joining the <a href="cavalierordersb99b.html?ItemName=Order%20of%20the%20Shield">order of the shield</a>. Most knights of Arnisant serve at Lastwall, where the movement originated, but they can be found everywhere from the general's homeland of Taldor to the front lines of the Worldwound.

Shield Expertise: At 1st level, a knight of Arnisant gains the <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a> feat as a bonus feat.
