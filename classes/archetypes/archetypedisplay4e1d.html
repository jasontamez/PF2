Kobolds' yammering songs distract opponents in combat, hindering their ability to attack.

Bardic Performance:  A dragon yapper gains the following types of bardic performance.

Yapping Song (Su): A dragon yapper can use performance to annoy those that hear it, causing them to take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls (minimum 1) and a -1 penalty on saves against fear effects and charm effects as long as the dragon yapper continues performing. This penalty increases by 1 at 5th level and every 6 levels thereafter. Yapping song is a mind-affecting ability that uses audible components, but is not language-dependent. This performance replaces fascinate.

Frightful Song (Su): A dragon yapper of 8th level or higher can amplify his voice to sound like an actual dragon. Enemies within 30 feet become shaken unless they succeed at a Will save (DC 10 +1/2 the dragon yapper's level + the dragon yapper's Charisma modifier). A successful save renders targets immune to this ability for 24 hours. Frightful song is a mind-affecting ability, and a fear effect that uses audible components. This performance replaces dirge of doom.

Versatile Performance (Ex):  A dragon yapper must choose sing at 2nd level.
