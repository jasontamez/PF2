Bards are experts at manipulating the emotions and perceptions of others. Negotiators are those bards who take the skills of a performer and apply them to the realms of business and law.

Hard Bargainer:  A negotiator adds half his class level (minimum 1) on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive checks. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

Bardic Performance:  A negotiator gains the following types of bardic performance.

Counterargument (Su): This performance acts as countersong, except a negotiator can use only Perform (act, comedy, oratory, or sing) to perform a counterargument.

Fast Talk (Su): At 1st level, a negotiator can use performance to affect the perceptions of any number of targets that can hear him. While the negotiator performs, these targets take a -1 penalty on saving throws against enchantment (charm) and illusion (figment, glamer, or shadow) effects, as well as a penalty on Appraise checks equal to half the negotiator's level (minimum -1). A target that fails its Appraise check believes that the object in question is worth 10% more or less (negotiator's choice) than its actual value. At 5th, 11th, and 17th levels, the saving throw penalty increases by 1 and the shift in an object's perceived value increases by 10%. Fast talk is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability that uses audible components. This performance replaces inspire courage.

Binding Contract (Sp): At 9th level, the negotiator can bind another creature's promise to the negotiator with a geas. This acts as <a href="spelldisplay20c8.html?ItemName=lesser%20geas">lesser geas</a>, except the creature must have Hit Dice equal to or less than the negotiator's level. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the negotiator's level + the negotiator's Charisma modifier). The geas is discharged if the negotiator breaks his end of the bargain. Using this ability requires 3 rounds of continuous performance, and the target must be able to see and hear the bard throughout the performance. At 18th level, this effect acts as <a href="spelldisplay8acc.html?ItemName=geas/quest">geas/quest</a> (no HD limit, and the target cannot attempt a saving throw). Binding contract is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability that relies on audible components. This performance replaces inspire greatness.

Rogue Talents:  At 2nd level, a negotiator gains a <a href="_roguetalents.html">rogue talent</a>, as the rogue class feature of the same name. At 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the negotiator gains an additional rogue talent. A negotiator cannot select a rogue talent that modifies the sneak attack ability. This ability replaces versatile performance.

Master of Rhetoric (Ex):  At 5th level, the negotiator can take 10 on any Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (local), or Sense Motive check if he has ranks in that skill. A negotiator can choose not to take 10 and can instead roll normally. In addition, the negotiator can take 20 on one of those skill checks (without spending any additional time). The negotiator can do this once per day at 5th level, twice per day at 11th level, and three times per day at 17th level. This ability replaces lore master.

Advanced Talents:  At 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a negotiator can select an <a href="_roguetalents.html">advanced rogue talent</a> in place of a rogue talent. A negotiator cannot select an advanced talent that modifies the sneak attack ability.
