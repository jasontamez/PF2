One of the grand goals of alchemy is the ability to create new life. A homunculist has made this dream a reality, growing and modifying a familiar in his own laboratory.

Diminished Poisoning:  A homunculist doesn't gain the poison use, poison resistance, poison immunity, or swift poisoning class features.

Homunculus Familiar (Ex):  The homunculist has created a living <a href="monsterdisplay1c3c.html?ItemName=Homunculus">homunculus</a> in the shape of an animal or vermin. It functions in all ways as a familiar, treating the homunculist's alchemist level as his effective wizard level. This ability replaces mutagen.

Experimentation (Ex):  A homunculist is constantly experimenting on his familiar to give it new and unusual features and abilities. At 4th level, the homunculist can grant his familiar 1 evolution point worth of eidolon evolutions for every 4 alchemist levels he possesses, though he can't select any evolutions that require a particular base form. Each time the homunculist gains a level, he can change his familiar's evolutions. These evolutions stack with those from the <a href="featdisplaya062.html?ItemName=Evolved%20Familiar">Evolved Familiar</a> feat. The homunculist can select the <a href="featdisplaya062.html?ItemName=Evolved%20Familiar">Evolved Familiar</a> feat as an alchemist discovery if he meets its prerequisites.
