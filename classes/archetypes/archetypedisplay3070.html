Blessed by his deity, a divine tracker hunts down those he deems deserving of his retribution. His weapon is likely to find purchase in his favored enemy.

Alignment:  A divine tracker's alignment must be within one step of his deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.

Favored Weapon:  At 1st level, a divine tracker becomes proficient with the favored weapon of his deity. If his deity's favored weapon is unarmed strike, he instead gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. This ability replaces wild empathy.

Blessings (Su):  At 4th level, a divine tracker forms a close bond with his deity's ethos. He selects two warpriest domains from among the domains granted by his deity, and gains the minor blessings of those domains. A divine tracker can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain. If a divine tracker isn't devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two blessings to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities, subject to GM approval. The restriction on alignment domains still applies. A divine tracker uses his ranger level as his warpriest level to determine the effect of the blessing. At 13th level, a divine tracker gains the major blessing from both of his domains. This ability replaces hunter's bond.
