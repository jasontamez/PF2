Some sorcerers have trouble accessing their innate gifts and must find another way to unlock them. For a sorcerer of sleep, the mind-altering drug pesh (see page 19) is the key. The garbled visions the drug provides allow a sorcerer of sleep to reach an ideal state for channeling her arcane power. The arcane and dreamspun bloodlines are the sorcerer heritages most often associated with pesh, though a sorcerer of sleep might exhibit any bloodline; pesh is a tool to enhance her gifts, rather than their source.

Pesh Expert:  A sorcerer of sleep adds 1/2 her sorcerer level (minimum 1) on Appraise, Craft (alchemy), Heal, and Knowledge (local) checks related to pesh and other drugs. This ability replaces bloodline arcana.

Sahir-Afiyun:  A sorcerer of sleep gains Sahir-Afiyun (see page 18) as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. A sorcerer of sleep adds Pesh Euphoria, Pesh Healing, Pesh Rejuvenation, and Sahir- Afiyun (see page 18 for these feats) to her list of bloodline feats. This ability replaces eschew materials.

Pesh Touch (Su):  As a standard action, a sorcerer of sleep can make a melee touch attack against a living creature to cause one of the following effects (sorcerer's choice): the target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, the target is fatigued, or the target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against illusion and mind-affecting effects. The effects of pesh touch last a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the sorcerer of sleep's sorcerer level. The effects of pesh touch are not cumulative, and cannot make the target exhausted. A sorcerer of sleep can use pesh touch a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This ability replaces the 1st-level bloodline power.
