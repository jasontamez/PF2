The heart of this companion beats with primal energy.

Elemental Type (Ex): An elemental companion gains a subtype that matches its element: air, earth, fire, or water.

Lesser Elemental Manifestation (Ex): At 2nd level, an elemental companion gains one or more special abilities based on its element. An air companion gains a 20% miss chance against ranged attacks. An earth companion gains DR 1/adamantine, and this damage reduction increases by 1 for every 4 druid levels the master has. A fire companion can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty, and it gains <a href="featdisplayc15b.html?ItemName=Nimble%20Moves">Nimble Moves</a> as a bonus feat. A water companion can breathe underwater, gains a swim speed of 20 feet, and gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity; a water companion that already has a swim speed instead increases its swim speed by 10 feet.

This replaces evasion and improved evasion.

Greater Elemental Manifestation (Su): At 9th level, an elemental companion gains an additional ability based on its element. An air companion gains a fly speed of 20 feet (good maneuverability); an air companion that already has a fly speed instead improves its maneuverability by one category. An earth companion's natural attacks overcome damage reduction as though they were adamantine, cold iron, and silver weapons. For a fire companion, choose one natural attack; that attack deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 5 Hit Dice the companion has. For a water companion, choose one melee natural attack; that attack gains the push (10 feet) special ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 300).

This replaces multiattack.
