Life channelers take the natural cycle to what they believe is its logical conclusion. By sacrificing the life of a sentient creature, they can generate energy that guarantees fertility and prosperity for lower creatures like plants and animals. These druids preach to flocks who become willing sacrifices, each serving as a "king" or "queen" for a short time after being chosen as the next sacrifice.

Alignment: In addition to a druid's usual alignment requirements, a life channeler must be of a nongood alignment. If she becomes good, she can no longer take levels in the druid class or fill her wicker talismans (see below), but she otherwise keeps all her abilities.

This alters the druid's alignment requirements.

Plant Preservation (Su): A life channeler must choose the Plant domain with her nature bond (she can select the Growth subdomain if she wishes). When she performs a coup de grace that kills a sentient humanoid creature (not a summoned creature), she can do so ritualistically in order to affect the area centered on the body with the enrichment version of plant growth. The sacrifice is a death effect.

This ability alters nature bond.

Wicker Talismans (Su): At 4th level, a life channeler gains a selection of wicker talismans that can store and convert the life energy of sentient creatures into the growth, health, and fertility of plants around her. The life channeler gains one wicker talisman corresponding to each level of druid spells she can cast, starting with 1st-level spells. These talismans are initially empty, but can hold life energy. When the life channeler ritualistically kills a creature with a coup de grace, she can store life energy in a talisman instead of gaining the plant growth effect. The creature must be of a CR equal to at least twice the spell level of the corresponding talisman. For instance, a CR 8 creature's life energy could provide energy for a talisman holding up to a 4th-level spell. A talisman is either full or empty; it can't hold more than one creature's life energy. A life channeler can expend the energy stored in a talisman to cast her domain spell of the talisman's level without expending a spell slot.

Starting at 6th level, a life channeler gathers a flock of willing sacrifices. This grants her the benefits of the Leadership feat, except that using a follower as a human sacrifice with this ability doesn't cause the life channeler to take a penalty to her Leadership score.

This ability replaces wild shape.

Rampant Growth: At 4th level, a life channeler can enrich the land more than usual with her sacrifices. When ritually killing a creature with a coup de grace for the plant growth enrichment effect or casting plant growth for the enrichment effect from one of her talismans, the effect has a range of 1 mile instead of a range of half a mile. At 8th level, if the sacrificed creature was at least CR 8, the effect lasts for 3 years instead of 1 year. At 12th level, if the sacrificed creature was at least CR 12, the effect increases productivity to two-thirds above normal, instead of one-third above normal. These effects stack, assuming the creature is high enough CR.

Stored Life: At 9th level, a life channeler gains a third option when using a coup de grace on a sentient humanoid. If the victim had a CR at least as high as the life channeler's class level, the life channeler can store the creature's life energy in her body. She can have the life energy from only 1 creature in her body at a time. While she is storing life energy, if she would take damage or die from a death effect or if she would gain negative levels or take energy drain, she can sacrifice the stored energy to negate the effect without spending an action.

This ability replaces venom immunity.
