Bard Masterpieces


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>
Talented bards can learn or create masterpieces, unusual applications of the bardic performance ability requiring special training. Masterpiece descriptions adhere to the following guidelines.

Masterpiece Name: In addition to the name of the masterpiece, this line indicates which Perform skill or skills the masterpiece relies upon.

Prerequisites: Like feats, masterpieces have prerequisites that a bard must meet in order to learn them. Only bards may learn masterpieces.

Cost: Each masterpiece has an associated cost to learn it. Typically, a bard must spend one of his bard spells known of a specific spell level or select it in place of a feat. The bard can spend a bard spell known of a level higher than the listed level to learn a masterpiece (for example, spending a 4th-level spell known to learn a masterpiece that requires spending a 3rd-level spell known).

Effect: This brief description summarizes what occurs when a bard performs the masterpiece. Unless otherwise stated, a masterpiece's effects are supernatural. Unwilling creatures may attempt a Will save against the effect of a masterpiece; the save DC for masterpieces is equal to 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma bonus. Masterpieces that duplicate spells use the bard's caster level for the spell's caster level.

Use: This line specifies how many bardic performance rounds the bard must use to activate the masterpiece. In some cases, the bard can extend the duration of the masterpiece by expending additional rounds of bardic performance, just as if it were any other use of bardic performance. The bard expends the listed number of bardic performance rounds when he starts performing the masterpiece; if he is interrupted, the attempt fails and the spent performance rounds are lost.

Action: This line indicates the type of action performing the masterpiece requires. If it only requires a standard action to activate, being able to activate a bardic performance more quickly (at 7th level, activation is a move action, and at 13th, it becomes a swift action) applies to the masterpiece as well.

Unless otherwise stated, effects or feats that extend the duration of bardic performance (such as the Lingering Performance feat in the Advanced Player's Guide) do not apply to masterpieces.

GMs can use these masterpieces to inspire their own ideas for other masterpieces. Masterpieces should generally be no more powerful than a cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell available to a caster of the same level as the minimum level needed to select the masterpiece (a masterpiece requiring 7 ranks in Perform requires a 7th-level bard, and thus should not be more powerful than a 4th-level cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell).

story of their race's creation.

Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) 13 ranks, ability to
speak Draconic.

Cost: Feat or 5th-level bard spell known.

Effect: This urgent verse tugs at the racial arrogance of dragonkind, compelling dragons, both true and lesser, to perform the epic alongside you. Any creatures of the dragon type that can hear this masterpiece must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to join in the performance.

Prerequisite: Perform (string instruments) or Perform (wind instruments) 7 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.

Effect: This piece, developed from ancient Azlanti musical records about the just rewards of honest striving, consists of a series of complicated crescendos, each culminating in a stirring, lengthy refrain.

You and up to one ally per bard level within the room who can hear you are clothed in illusory exotic fabrics, furs, and jewels while in the room.

<td>Arrowsong's Lament (Oratory)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9i8l?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Arcane-Anthology">Arcane Anthology pg. 31</a>
This collection of brooding poetry, all in pentatonic verse, expresses Arrowsong's frustration over her overbearing parents' desire for her to become a spellcaster. Her in-depth analysis of their struggles and failings provides great insight into reading and memorizing spells from a spellbook.

Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) 3 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 1st-level spell known or higher (see text).

Effect: Rather than a single work, this masterpiece is a collection of poems from Arrowsong's days living under her scholarly parents, who both desperately wanted their daughter to pursue the art of wizardry. Despite the poems' wry tone and the overall distaste for book-learning they proclaim, Arrowsong's verse perfectly documents the process of memorizing arcane spells. When you gain this masterpiece, it becomes associated with your bard spells of a specific spell level. If you paid the masterpiece's cost by spending a bard spell you know, the masterpiece is associated with spells of the spent spell's level. If you paid the masterpiece's cost by spending a feat, you choose one bard spell level that you are able to cast with which to associate the masterpiece.

In order to perform this masterpiece, you must be holding a spellbook, scroll, or a similar piece of arcane writing to consult. After completing the masterpiece, choose one arcane spell from your bard spell list or from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is written on the arcane writing that you consulted during the masterpiece. If the spell is on your bard spell list, it must be of the same level (or lower) as the spell level associated with this masterpiece. If the spell is not on your bard spell list, its level must be at least 2 spell levels lower than the spell level associated with this masterpiece. Add the chosen spell to the bard spell list and to your list of bard spells known until the next time that you rest and regain spells.

If you use a spellbook with a preparation ritual to perform the masterpiece, you also gain the boon associated with that spellbook, as if you had prepared a spell from it. You can add up to one spell per spell level that you have selected with this masterpiece to your list of bard spells known each day. You can gain this masterpiece multiple times. Each time, you must apply it to a different bard spell level.

Use: 3 rounds of bardic performance per level of the spell.

This confusing dirge of melody and counter-melody was
composed for choirs celebrating the various martyrs of

become to many.

For creatures on a ship, this effect means taking efforts to alter course and sail away. An affected creature continues its efforts for as long as the performance continues, and it reacts with violence to anyone attempting to prevent it from fleeing.

Your skilled playing can conjure up supernatural servants.

Prerequisite: Perform (string) 11 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.

Effect: This fast-paced tune harmonizes with the magical frequencies of another plane, allowing you to draw an extraplanar creature to you and bargain for its service. When you complete this performance, you call one or more outsiders as if using <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a>. Unlike with <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a>, the creature is not necessarily associated with your deity, and has an initial attitude of "indifferent" toward you. Because it is intrigued by your performance, it remains for up to 1 minute to hear the service you are requesting and the payment you are offering. If you succeed at an opposed Charisma check against the creature (with a +0 to +6 bonus on your roll based on the nature of the service and the offered reward), it agrees to perform the service. This ability otherwise works like <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a>.

Though the best-known version of this masterpiece refers to an infernal bargain, it can be used to conjure any sort of extraplanar creature (such as an archon, elemental, or protean). Other versions and arrangements of this masterpiece may have different names but otherwise identical effects.

The energy type can be either acid, cold, or fire (your choice, chosen when you begin performing the masterpiece).

Affected creatures that fail their saving throws take damage on the round you begin the performance and each round you continue the performance as long as they remain in range. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance affect this masterpiece.

The divine sunlight caused by this dance banishes darkness and causes flowers to bloom.

Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 11 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.

Effect: You begin your dance slowly, focusing on exact posture, the position of your limbs, even the direction of your gaze, then build to a blur of motion. Upon completing the performance, you summon a fixed aura of divine sunlight that glows in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on you.

The divine sunlight acts as true daylight and affects creatures damaged or destroyed by such light. The light is as bright as sunlight at full noon and counters or dispels any <a href="spelldisplay47a2.html?ItemName=darkness">darkness</a> spells of 4th level or lower. If the dance is performed in an area of more powerful magical darkness, both the divine sunlight and darkness are temporarily negated so that otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

Within the area of the sunlight, plants grow and blossom rapidly, becoming a overgrown tangle. This effect mimics the overgrowth version of <a href="spelldisplay0b35.html?ItemName=plant%20growth">plant growth</a>.

You can hurl your allies into battle by directing swift winds.

Prerequisite: Perform (act) or Perform (dance) 7 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.

Effect: Your whirling motions summon a 15-foot-high cyclone into an empty space adjacent to you. This cyclone persists until you stop using bardic performance to sustain it, and extends an additional 15 feet in height each round you sustain it until it reaches a ceiling or other obstacle. As a move action, you can direct the cyclone to harmlessly flow around one willing creature adjacent to the cyclone and move the creature to any other square adjacent to the cyclone at any height the cyclone has reached.

Prerequisite: Perform (percussion) or Perform (sing) 4 ranks.

Effect: You tap out or sing a diverting tune that sticks in the mind of the target, causing the target to take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on concentration checks for 10 minutes.

Prerequisite: Perform (keyboard, sing, string, or wind) 4 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.

Effect: Whenever you end a bardic performance, you can add a quick reprise that makes it unnaturally catchy. Any creature within 30 feet of you when you finish your performance will run the risk of having your tune replaying endlessly in its mind. Unless the creature succeeds on a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your bard level + your Charisma modifier), the tune distracts it for 1 day per bard level. The creature takes a -4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and Perception checks as long as it remains distracted. The creature's sleep also becomes fitful, requiring half again as long for the usual benefit and entirely negating the benefits of full bed rest beyond a normal rest. Once per day upon waking after rest, the creature can attempt a new Will saving throw to shake off the relentless reprise. If it fails, the creature takes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d4 points of sanity damage if using the sanity rules from Horror Adventures). This is a curse effect with audible components.

Effect: This song follows a set repetition of verses and refrains with a pattern of syllables that remains constant from line to line. As you sing, listeners find their actions bound by your song's relentless order. One enemy per bard level within listening range must make a successful Will save or find its movements hampered. A creature that fails its save can move only in a straight line each turn. The creature can choose which direction it wishes to move each turn, but it can move only along a straight line in that direction, and cannot move around corners or otherwise deviate from this line until its next turn.

For each round you continue to expend bardic performance rounds, the area experiences a round-long aftershock, which has the following effects.

Caves, Caverns, or Tunnels: Smaller collapses cause 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 5 half ) and pin any creatures caught inside.
Cliffs: More cliffs crumble, creating a landslide that travels half as far horizontally as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 5 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble.
Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 5 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance of falling into one (Reflex DC 10 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 20 feet deep, and these fissures remain open at the end of the quake.
Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned by the effects of the aftershock takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, she must make a DC 5 Constitution check or take 1d3 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

Your acting conjures hellfire and salt to destroy plants.

Prerequisite: Perform (act) or Perform (comedy) 6 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 2nd-level spell known.

Effect: This pantomime tells the tale of Gorroc, a foolish farmer who failed to control the weeds that grew so quickly upon his land. In desperation, Gorroc bargained with a devil, who blasted the earth with salt and withering heat, leaving the fertile land desolate for a century. When you complete the performance, you can create a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line that is blasted with scorching air and hot salt. Plants and oozes in this area take 1d6 points of damage per bard level (maximum 10d6); half this damage is fire damage, half is piercing damage. A Reflex save reduces the damage by half. Creatures other than plants or oozes take half damage, or no damage on a successful save.

Use: 2 bardic performance rounds.

Action: 1 full round.</td>

<td>The House of Imaginary Walls (Act)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 23</a>
You can trap opponents with the power of your acting.

Prerequisite: Perform (act) 10 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.

Effect: You silently mime building an invisible wall, flattening your hands along linear planes to indicate its location and orientation. This "wall" is only real for creatures that see you perform this masterpiece (Will negates); you and your allies may automatically fail your saves if you want to treat the wall as real (for example, if you want to use the wall as a bridge to cross a chasm). For creatures who believe the wall is real, it has hardness 8, 90 hit points, and a break DC of 30 (multiple believing creatures can attack the walls, breaking through it more quickly as if they were all attacking a real wall rather than each attacking separate mental constructs). This is an illusion (phantasm) effect. Because the wall is a mental image, it blocks incorporeal creatures that fail their saves (because they perceive it as a magical barrier that excludes them), though they can still go around the wall or through the floor or ceiling to bypass it. It does not affect objects or creatures immune to mental effects (which can result in situations like an archer firing through the wall but unable to physically cross it).

You can create one 10-foot-square wall per use of this ability; over several rounds you can extend this square or create other walls, all of which persist until you stop using bardic performance rounds to sustain them. The wall is immobile once created. Part of the wall must be in or along the edge of your space, and you cannot create a wall that extends beyond your natural reach (though you can create a wall, move, and create another by using this ability again). Once created, the wall exists until you end your performance or affected creatures "break" it. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as <a href="featdisplay67e5.html?ItemName=Lingering%20Performance">Lingering Performance</a>) affect this masterpiece.

Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.

Action: 1 standard action per 10-foot square.</td>

<td>The Lullaby of Ember the Ancient (Sing)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 23</a>
You can put powerful creatures to sleep with the power of your song.

Prerequisite: Perform (sing) 7 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.

Effect: When you activate this soothing performance, one target within close range falls asleep as if affected by <a href="spelldisplay9b29.html?ItemName=deep%20slumber">deep slumber</a> as long as you maintain the performance. Unlike the spell (which affects weaker creatures first), this masterpiece targets a specific creature of your choice. Although this lullaby does have words, it is not a language-dependent effect.

Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.

Action: 1 round.</td>

<td>The Quickening Pulse (Percussion, Wind)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 24</a>
Your driving notes cause unnatural heart rates in your opponents.

Prerequisite: Perform (percussion) 7 ranks or Perform (wind) 7 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.

Effect: You create a musical tempo that first mirrors your enemies' heartbeats, and then quickens them to dangerous levels. When you complete the performance, all enemies within 30 feet who can hear your performance must save or take 1d6 points of damage as their pounding heart causes them to sweat blood. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are unaffected by this ability.

Each round that you continue the performance adds another round to the bleed effect. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as <a href="featdisplay67e5.html?ItemName=Lingering%20Performance">Lingering Performance</a>) affect this masterpiece.

Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of bleed.

Action: 1 standard action.</td>

<td>The Requiem of the Fallen Priest-King (Oratory, Sing)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 24</a>
Your performance reveals ways to cheat time itself.

Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) 10 ranks or Perform (sing) 10 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.

Effect: This piece tells the story of a mighty priest-king who seemed to defy time by snatching near-victory from an overwhelming number of enemies. When you complete the performance, you gain the ability to accelerate time once, which must be used in the next 10 minutes. When you perform this masterpiece, you gain the ability to spend a swift action to perform a nonmagical action that normally requires a move action or a standard action. For example, you could make a full attack, then spend a swift action to take a normal move, load a light crossbow, or draw a weapon in the same round. You must use this extra action within 10 minutes of performing the masterpiece; otherwise the benefit is lost.

This ability does not stack with other effects that increase your speed (such as <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a>) or alter time (such as <a href="spelldisplaye421.html?ItemName=time%20stop">time stop</a>).

Your allies may benefit from this masterpiece, but they must listen to it intently (to the exclusion of all other activities) for the duration of the performance, and you must expend 1 round of bardic performance for each ally other than yourself whom you want to gain the ability to accelerate time (for example, affecting yourself and five others requires expending 11 rounds of bardic performance). This is a language-dependent effect.

Use: 5 bardic performance rounds, +1 round per additional person affected.

Action: 1 minute.</td>

<td>The Rheumy Refrain (Sing)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8qzz?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Fiends">Blood of Fiends pg. 28</a>
Your strange melody of hacking gasps and pained wheezes draws upon the dark powers of Abaddon to fill a witness with debilitating and distracting phlegm.

Prerequisite: Perform (sing) 5 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.

Effect: Your song emulates the sounds of a terrible illness, causing one creature you are aware of who can hear your song to develop a psychosomatic flu. If the target fails its Will save, whenever it attempts any action other than moving up to its base speed or making a single melee attack (but not both) in a single round, it must succeed at a concentration check (DC 10 + your Charisma modifier) to avoid wasting its action because of a fit of coughing and sneezing.

Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.

Action: 1 standard action.</td>

<td>The Sea Is Now My Sky (Sing, String)

Your thrilling tune causes you and your allies to fly through the water as easily as a bird soars through the air.

Prerequisite: Perform (sing) or Perform (string instruments) 9 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 3rd-level bard spell known.

Effect: You and a number of allies (up to one creature per bard level) who can see and hear you gain a swim speed of 40 feet and a bonus on Swim checks equal to half your caster level. When using this masterpiece for long-distance travel, you and your affected allies can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires Constitution checks). This means you and affected allies can cover 8 miles underwater in an hour of swimming. If an ally can no longer see or hear you, she loses this benefit.

Use: 1 round of bardic performance per creature affected for each hour of the effect's duration.

Action: 1 full round.</td>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9wmz?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Ancients">Blood of the Ancients pg. 31</a>
You remind those around you of the mystic's warning and how danger was ignored in expectation of Aroden's return.

Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing) 4 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.

Effect: You create a feeling of deceptive confidence in an enemy. When you activate this performance, one target within 30 feet becomes flat-footed for as long as you maintain the performance (Will negates). If you target a creature that has not yet acted in a surprise round, the creature does not get to act in the surprise round. Any target with the uncanny dodge class feature or an ability with a similar effect is immune to this performance. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.

Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.

Action: 1 standard action.</td>

Your deliberate dancing causes your foes' steps to fall in time to your own.

Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 10 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.

Effect: You enact a series of graceful, measured steps that your enemies cannot help but mimic. When you complete the performance, any foe within 60 feet that can see you is slowed (as per the <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> spell) for as long as you continue the performance. A Will saving throw negates this effect.

Each round you continue the performance, each slowed creature within 60 feet (whether slowed by this masterpiece or by another effect) must succeed at another Will saving throw or its penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves increases by 1 as the slow dance movements overtake it. This increased penalty lasts as long as you continue the performance. A creature that succeeds at this Will saving throw merely avoids increasing the penalty for that round; success does not remove the effect that slowed it.

Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.

Action: 1 full round.</td>

<td>The Winds of the Five Heavens (Act, Oratory)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 25</a>
You control the wind by telling a tale demonstrating the hubris of mortals.

Prerequisite: Perform (act) or Perform (oratory) 10 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.

Effect: This short monologue tells the story of a village priest who thought to command the gods. This so annoyed the gods of the weather that they gave him exactly what he wished for, and the priest's long-winded sermons tore apart his temple and scattered his parishioners. When you complete the performance, you conjure a great wind as if you had cast <a href="spelldisplay3360.html?ItemName=control%20winds">control winds</a>.

<td>Toccata and Fugue of the Danse Macabre (Keyboard, Wind)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 24</a>
Your spooky music blurs the boundaries between life and death, confusing the senses of undead creatures.

Prerequisite: Perform (keyboard) or Perform (wind) 4 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.

Effect: The complex notes and layered repetitions of this masterpiece bring to mind the countless dead of ages past and suffuse those who listen to it with a subtle melancholia and grim acceptance of the temporary nature of life. Starting with a trio of notes, repeated frequently and with evergreater insistence, it becomes a whirling, head-spinning vortex of sound. Upon completing the performance, you and up to one ally per level within listening range become hidden from undead, as if under the effects of a <a href="spelldisplay31d1.html?ItemName=hide%20from%20undead">hide from undead</a> spell.

As with <a href="spelldisplay31d1.html?ItemName=hide%20from%20undead">hide from undead</a>, one creature breaking the effect ends the benefit of the performance for all recipients. But by spending an additional round of bardic performance when you perform or maintain the masterpiece, you can dedicate a refrain to a particular ally; even if one ally breaks the <a href="spelldisplay31d1.html?ItemName=hide%20from%20undead">hide from undead</a> effect, the ally receiving the dedication remains hidden so long as he does not break the effect himself. You can dedicate a refrain multiple times in the performance (up to once per round) as long as you spend 1 round of bardic performance each time for the ally receiving a dedication.

Use: 1 bardic performance round per round of the performance, +1 round per ally affected, +1 round per dedicated refrain.

Action: 1 minute.</td>

Your lively cadence puts a spring in the step of weary marchers.

Prerequisite: Perform (percussion) 3 ranks, Perform (string) 3 ranks, or Perform (wind) 3 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 1st-level bard spell known.

Effect: This bright and spritely tune mimics the sound of human feet, slowly building to a steady, ground-eating pace. When you complete this performance, you affect one ally in hearing range per bard level. This masterpiece increases the affected target's base land speed by 10 feet for 1 hour. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Acrobatics skill).

Use: 1 bardic performance round.

Your bombastic speech creates booming reverberations of sound.

Prerequisite: Perform (act), Perform (oratory), or Perform (sing) 10 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.

Effect: You provide an impassioned monologue from the point of view of a noble queen, voicing her inner turmoil at being betrayed by her own sister and calling for justice to strike from the heavens. If you perform this masterpiece with the Perform (sing) skill, it is a tempestuous aria instead of a rousing soliloquy.

Upon completing the performance, you may conjure bolts of lightning as though you had cast <a href="spelldisplayd998.html?ItemName=call%20lightning%20storm">call lightning storm</a>, except the bolts are made of elemental thunder and deal sonic damage rather than electricity damage. The bolts do not increase in damage if outdoors in a stormy area. Instead, in any environment, you may attempt a DC 25 Perform check as part of the standard action to call a bolt. If your Perform check is successful, that bolt deals 5d10 points of sonic damage instead of 5d6.

Use: 5 bardic performance rounds.

Prerequisite: Perform (sing) 7 ranks or Perform (wind instruments) 7 ranks.

Effect: When you complete the performance, one creature within 30 feet is affected by <a href="spelldisplaya05c.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20I">beast shape I</a>. If your caster level is at least 10th, you can affect that creature with <a href="spelldisplaycb83.html?ItemName=baleful%20polymorph">baleful polymorph</a> instead; an affected creature automatically succeeds at the spell's secondary save.

Your saga magically weaves the counsel of sagacious ancestors into the telling.

Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing) 15 ranks.

Cost: Feat or 5th-level bard spell known.

Effect: You begin an epic tale of kings and queens in ages past, recounting their lineages and sage deeds. The epic has no fixed form and has substantial room for improvisation; many bards include tales of their own wise ancestors, or the ancestors of noteworthy members of their audience. When you activate the performance, one target creature other than you within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) gains the benefit of a <a href="spelldisplaya528.html?ItemName=commune">commune</a> spell. You must continue the performance for the target to receive answers, as your retelling is magically guided to include relevant responses.
