Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 8</a>
For some heroes, the rage that lives within them can't be contained. Whether this fury is a product of heritage or of nature, these adventurers have learned to harness it, turning its power against their foes. The primal warriors known as barbarians transform their rage into a potent weapon on a battlefield. Heedless of their wounds and possessed of unstoppable bloodlust, these savage brutes are the embodiment of war.

Unchained: The unchained barbarian is similar in many regards to its counterpart in the Core Rulebook'she still goes into a rage and gains rage powers, but many of the details have been changed. Rage now grants temporary hit points and static bonuses on attack and damage rolls, rather than bonuses to ability scores that force players to recalculate a number of statistics. Additionally, many rage powers now function whenever the barbarian is raging, as opposed to just once per rage. Finally, the overall utility of many of the rage powers has been adjusted to make them more useful and interesting.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.
Hit Die: d12.
Starting Wealth: 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Fast Movement (Ex): A barbarian's base speed is faster than the norm for her race by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when she is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn. This bonus stacks with any other bonuses to the barbarian's base speed.

Rage (Ex): A barbarian can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity, granting her additional combat prowess. At 1st level, a barbarian can rage for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. For each level after 1st she possesses, the barbarian can rage for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as that gained from bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that a barbarian can rage per day. A barbarian can enter a rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours need not be consecutive.

While in a rage, a barbarian gains a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. In addition, she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. She also gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die. These temporary hit points are lost first when a character takes damage, disappear when the rage ends, and are not replenished if the barbarian enters a rage again within 1 minute of her previous rage. While in a rage, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting).

A barbarian can end her rage as a free action, and is fatigued for 1 minute after a rage ends. A barbarian can't enter a new rage while fatigued or exhausted, but can otherwise enter a rage multiple times per day. If a barbarian falls unconscious, her rage immediately ends.

Rage Powers (Ex): As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the barbarian gains a rage power. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging. Some of these powers are always active during a rage, and others require the barbarian to take an action to use them. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.

Some of the following rage powers are stances. Activating a stance rage power is a move action. A barbarian can't have more than one stance rage power active at a time. If she activates a stance rage power while another one is active, the current stance immediately ends. The stance can be intentionally ended at the beginning of the barbarian's turn as a free action; otherwise, it lasts until the rage ends.

See the <a href="_barbarianunchainedragepowers.html">Barbarian (Unchained) Rage Power</a> section for a full list of Rage Powers from all sources.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.

If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

Danger Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks by traps. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on Perception checks to avoid being surprised by a foe. These bonuses increase by 1 every 3 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This ability counts as trap sense for any feat or class prerequisite, and can be replaced by any archetype class feature that replaces trap sense. The bonuses gained from this ability stack with those gained from trap sense (if the barbarian has trap sense from another class).

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies enemies the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least 4 more levels in a class that provides sneak attack than the barbarian has barbarian levels.

If the barbarian also has uncanny dodge from another class, levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level required to flank the barbarian.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At 7th level, a barbarian gains damage reduction. Each time the barbarian takes damage from a weapon or natural attack, subtract 1 from the damage taken. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage reduction rises by 1 point (up to 5 points at 19th level). Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0.

Greater Rage (Ex): At 11th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +3. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 3 per Hit Die.

Indomitable Will (Ex): At 14th level, the barbarian gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells while raging. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves she gains during her rage.

Tireless Rage (Ex): At 17th level, a barbarian is no longer fatigued at the end of her rage. If she enters a rage again within 1 minute of ending a rage, she doesn't gain any temporary hit points from her rage.

Mighty Rage (Ex): At 20th level, a barbarian's bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, thrown weapon damage rolls, and Will saves while raging increases to +4. In addition, the amount of temporary hit points gained when entering a rage increases to 4 per Hit Die.

Alternate Capstones

When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.


Perfect Body, Flawless Mind (Ex)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 31</a>
At 20th level, the character's endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability.


The Boss (Ex)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 30</a>
At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero'she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability.


Unstoppable (Ex)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 28</a>
At 20th level, nothing can kill the barbarian, though not for lack of trying. The barbarian gains DR 3/- or increases the value of any existing damage reduction by 3. In addition, she gains energy resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire equal to her DR/- value.


With This Sword (Ex)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 31</a>
At 20th level, the character's blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has-preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability.


Won't Stay Dead (Ex)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 31</a>
At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability.


Favored Class Options

Kitsune (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 12</a>): Gain 1/6 of a new Magical Tail feat. Any kitsune character can choose this bonus upon gaining a level in her favored class.
