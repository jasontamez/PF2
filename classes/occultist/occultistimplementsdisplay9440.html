This panoply is associated with brave and stalwart warriors, martial skill, and the defense of one's allies.

Implements: Shield (abjuration) and weapon (transmutation).

Resonant Power: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into all of the associated implements, the panoply grants the following resonant power. The panoply's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.

Martial Skill (Ex): When wielding the weapon used as the panoply's associated implement, you treat your base attack bonus as though it were 1 point higher for every 4 points of total mental focus invested in all of the associated implements, to a maximum base attack bonus equal to your occultist level. This increase can grant you additional attacks when using the full attack action (for example, a 12th-level occultist with 12 points of mental focus invested among the associated implements would be treated as having a base attack bonus of +11, with iterative attacks at a base attack bonus of +6 and +1).

Base Focus Power: All occultists who learn to use this panoply gain the following focus power.

Combat Trick (Ex): As a move action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to gain a single combat feat for which you qualify. This benefit lasts for 1 minute.

Focus Powers: In addition to the base focus power, occultists who learn to use this panoply can select the following focus powers when choosing powers gained from their focus powers class feature.

Counterstrike (Ex): As an immediate action when you are damaged by a melee attack, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to immediately make a single attack at your highest base attack bonus against the creature that hit you, provided that you threaten that creature. If the attack hits, you gain a bonus on the damage roll equal to 1/3 your occultist level (rounded down, minimum +1). This attack counts as an attack of opportunity.

Shield Ally (Ex): As an immediate action when an adjacent ally is the target of a spell or attack, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to redirect that spell or attack to yourself instead. You must declare that you are using this ability before the result of any attack roll is known or before any saving throws are attempted.

Warrior's Resilience (Su): As an immediate action when you would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, you can expend 1 or more points of mental focus to remain at 0 hit points instead. Using this focus power costs 1 point of mental focus for every 5 points of damage below 0 that you would otherwise be reduced to (rounded up, minimum 1 point of mental focus). This has no effect on anything that would kill you without reducing your hit points below 0, such as a failed saving throw against a death effect.
