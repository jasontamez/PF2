Orders - Cavalier/Samurai









Cavalier/Samurai Orders


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide</a>
At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

The following orders can be chosen by both samurai and cavaliers, although the former are far more likely to do so. Samurai can also select any of the cavalier orders presented in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.



Order of the Shroud

Cavaliers of this order seek out and destroy undead and those who harbor or create them. They scour old crypts, graveyards, and battlefields to bring eternal rest.

Edicts: The cavalier must protect the common folk from the scourge of the undead. He must seek out and destroy the restless dead and give aid to those haunted by them. He must protect those who cannot defend themselves, and root out sources that birth the corruption of life and death.

Challenge: Whenever an order of the shroud cavalier issues a challenge to an undead creature, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge for 1 minute. The bonus increases by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.

Skills: An order of the shroud cavalier adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Knowledge (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the shroud cavalier can attempt Knowledge (religion) checks untrained. If he has ranks in that skill, as long as a Knowledge (religion) check involves undead or haunts, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).

Order Abilities: A cavalier belonging to the order of the shroud gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

Spiritual Shield (Su): At 2nd level, the cavalier can call upon the spirits of the fallen for protection. Once per day as an immediate action when attacked by an undead target of his challenge, the cavalier can gain a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier to his AC against that attack. The cavalier must decide to use this ability before the attack roll.

Destroyer of the Undead (Su): At 8th level, the cavalier's weapons are treated as having the cavalier's alignment for the purpose of overcoming the damage reduction of undead creatures. Against an undead target of his challenge, the cavalier automatically overcomes all damage reduction that undead possesses.

Stand Against Darkness (Ex or Su): At 15th level, the cavalier can take revenge on undead that dare strike him or those he seeks to protect. Whenever an undead creature that is the subject of his challenge hits the cavalier or an adjacent ally with a melee attack, the creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier gains a +2 morale bonus on attacks of opportunity provoked as a result of this ability. If an undead subject of the cavalier's challenge threatens a critical hit against the cavalier, the cavalier gains a deflection bonus equal to his Charisma modifier against the confirmation roll. This bonus functions as a supernatural ability.
