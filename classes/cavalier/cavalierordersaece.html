Orders - Cavalier/Samurai









Cavalier/Samurai Orders


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide</a>
At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

The following orders can be chosen by both samurai and cavaliers, although the former are far more likely to do so. Samurai can also select any of the cavalier orders presented in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.



Order of the Waves

Cavaliers of the order of the waves explore the secrets under the sea.

Edicts: The cavalier must perpetually seek out and explore new places and secrets under the sea, stopping only to fight to protect his newfound treasures and his people from undersea threats (typically evil undersea races like sahuagin, but alternatively goodly or neutral enemy races for cavaliers from evil races).

Challenge: Whenever a cavalier of the order of the waves issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on his saving throws as long as he is underwater. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier has.

Skills: A cavalier belonging to the order of the waves adds Knowledge (geography) and Perception to his class skills. He can attempt Knowledge (geography) checks untrained, but if he has ranks in the skill, he adds half his cavalier level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge (geography) checks that involve finding an underwater location.

Order Abilities: A cavalier belonging to this order gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

Waverider (Ex): At 2nd level, the cavalier gains a swim speed equal to his unmodified base land speed. If he already has a swim speed, his swim speed increases by 10 feet, and if he and his mount both have a swim speed, the mount's swim speed also increases by 10 feet. He gains a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls when underwater.

Current's Rush (Ex): At 8th level, the cavalier gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls when charging in the same direction as a current that's currently pushing him, as well as a +1 bonus on damage rolls for every 10 feet of the current's speed (maximum +6 points of damage).

Explore the Seas (Ex): At 15th level, the cavalier gains <a href="featdisplayf536.html?ItemName=Pressure%20Adept">Pressure Adept</a> as a bonus feat and adds two oceanic zones to his native range instead of one. When exploring a new location underwater, he gains a +2 morale bonus on initiative checks and Perception checks, and can always act in the surprise round.
