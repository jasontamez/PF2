Orders - Cavalier/Samurai









Cavalier/Samurai Orders


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide</a>
At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

The following orders can be chosen by both samurai and cavaliers, although the former are far more likely to do so. Samurai can also select any of the cavalier orders presented in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.



Order of the Beast (ISC)

A cavalier belonging to this order seeks only destruction and chaos. Cavaliers of the order of the beast revel in destruction, and go out of their way to cause as much mayhem and disorder as possible. While some celebrate war and a victory well fought, an order of the beast cavalier fights only to taste the blood of his dying foe. Members of this order are often insane, and may venerate <a href="deitydisplaya42b.html?ItemName=Rovagug">Rovagug</a> or the elder gods and Great Old Ones of the Dark Tapestry. There are no colleges or universities where an aspiring cavalier can learn the ways of the order of the beast; it is a corruption of the other cavalier orders, and its secrets are whispered in the dreams of unbalanced youths by dark beings and passed down in forbidden rituals.

On Golarion, order of the beast cavaliers are most often found leading orc tribes on raids from within the Hold of Belkzen, commanding small bands of brigands or raiders in the Mana Wastes, or sowing chaos anywhere a destructive leader is welcomed or venerated, particularly in lands where the law holds little sway.

Edicts: The cavalier wreaks havoc wherever he goes. An order of the beast cavalier must never show mercy and, when crossed, exacts the maximum possible revenge. The cavalier must seek out conflict at every juncture and cannot avoid a fight if provoked. That which he cannot steal, pillage, or claim, he must completely destroy or desecrate.

Challenge: Whenever an order of the beast cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all damage rolls while using <a href="featdisplay2107.html?ItemName=Cleave">Cleave</a> or <a href="featdisplay6bcb.html?ItemName=Great%20Cleave">Great Cleave</a> so long as the target of his challenge is the first creature attacked. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier possesses.

Skills: An order of the beast cavalier adds Disable Device (Dex) and Stealth (Dex) to his list of class skills. An order of the beast cavalier can make Disable Device checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) when using it to sabotage, jam, or destroy a device.

Order Abilities: A cavalier belonging to the order of the beast gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

Vandal (Ex): At 2nd level, the cavalier gains <a href="featdisplay2c99.html?ItemName=Improved%20Sunder">Improved Sunder</a> as a bonus feat. In addition, when dealing damage to objects (including when using the sunder combat maneuver), he adds half his cavalier level to the damage roll. If an order of the beast cavalier successfully breaks an object, he receives a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls until the end of his next turn.

Havoc (Ex): At 8th level, the cavalier's mount gains the trample monster special ability. If the cavalier's mount has trample from another source, damage from the mount's trample attack instead increases as though the mount were one size category larger (see Table 3-1 on page 302 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary); this does not alter the damage dealt by the mount's slam attack. A creature that attempts a Reflex saving throw to avoid damage from the mount's trample attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier.

Unstoppable Ravager (Ex): At 15th level, the cavalier becomes an unstoppable engine of destruction. If the cavalier's current hit points drop below 0, he does not fall unconscious. Instead, he continues to act so long as his negative hit point total does not exceed the amount of damage he dealt to an enemy on a single melee attack during the last round. The cavalier receives no Constitution check to stabilize while using this ability, and automatically takes 1 point of damage each round. When his current negative hit points exceed his negative Constitution score, the amount of damage he must deal to continue to act is now equal to the difference between his current negative hit point total and his negative Constitution score. Additionally, the cavalier can no longer benefit from magical healing (save for a <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> or <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> spell), and he immediately dies once he can no longer take an action due to this ability.
