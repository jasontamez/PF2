Orders - Cavalier/Samurai









Cavalier/Samurai Orders


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide</a>
At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

The following orders can be chosen by both samurai and cavaliers, although the former are far more likely to do so. Samurai can also select any of the cavalier orders presented in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.



Order of the Blossom

Cavaliers of the order of the blossom dedicate their lives to protecting fey, especially those visiting the Material Plane from the First World. These cavaliers might be fey themselves, but even if they aren't, they exhibit the same whimsy and occasionally cruel sense of humor typical of most denizens of the First World.

Edicts: The cavalier cannot refuse a fey's request for aid unless it will interfere with his existing duties, or he believes the fey seeks to directly oppose his other aims and goals. He must strive to prevent gates to the First World from being exploited or corrupted. If the cavalier encounters <a href="monsterdisplaye67b.html?ItemName=Blighted%20Fey%20(Satyr)">blighted fey</a> or other corrupted fey, he must strive to destroy them.

Challenge: Whenever an order of the blossom cavalier issues a challenge, the target of the challenge takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities used by fey or by the cavalier. This penalty increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has. An order of the blossom cavalier can't issue a challenge against any creature of the fey type unless that creature has the blighted fey template.

Skills: An order of the blossom cavalier adds Disguise and Knowledge (nature) to his list of class skills. An order of the blossom cavalier can attempt Knowledge (nature) skill checks untrained. Whenever an order of the blossom cavalier attempts a Bluff check to feint in combat, he receives a bonus on the check equal to half his cavalier level (minimum +1).

Order Abilities: A cavalier belonging to the order of the blossom gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

Sneak Attack (Ex): At 2nd level, an order of the blossom cavalier can make a sneak attack, as the rogue ability of the same name. At 2nd level, his sneak attack damage is +1d6. This damage increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter. If the cavalier gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonus damage stacks.

Fey Enchantments (Sp): At 8th level, an order of the blossom cavalier learns to use the following spell-like abilities: <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf219.html?ItemName=enthrall">enthrall</a>, <a href="spelldisplayb793.html?ItemName=hideous%20laughter">hideous laughter</a>, and <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a>, with a caster level equal to his cavalier level. He can use these spell-like abilities a total of three times per day, in any combination (such as by casting <a href="spelldisplayf219.html?ItemName=enthrall">enthrall</a> three times, or <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a> once and <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> twice). The saving throw DC for these spell-like abilities is 10 + half the cavalier's level + his Charisma modifier. At 16th level, the cavalier can use his spell-like abilities seven times per day, and he adds <a href="spelldisplaye96b.html?ItemName=charm%20monster">charm monster</a> and <a href="spelldisplay39c8.html?ItemName=terrible%20remorse">terrible remorse</a> to the list.

Curse of the First World (Su): At 15th level, an order of the blossom cavalier channels pandemonium through his weapon. His melee attacks count as chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, whenever he confirms a critical hit against a target under an enchantment effect, that target is confused for 1d6 rounds. Each round the confused creature rolls to determine its action, it rolls twice and the cavalier chooses which result to use. This is a mind-affecting effect.
