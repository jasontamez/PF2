Orders - Cavalier/Samurai









Cavalier/Samurai Orders


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide</a>
At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

The following orders can be chosen by both samurai and cavaliers, although the former are far more likely to do so. Samurai can also select any of the cavalier orders presented in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.

Cavaliers of the order of the Green are dedicated to protecting wild places and creatures, embracing the <a href="deitydisplay6eac.html?ItemName=Green%20Faith">Green Faith</a> in all its glory and natural wonder.

Edicts: The cavalier knows his place in the natural order and strives to defend the balance of nature. He must be willing to allow nature to take its course, and he must stop all those who would do harm to its delicate balance. He will not tolerate aberrant creatures, undead, or the irresponsible and greedy consumption of natural resources. He may be farsighted and seek to establish agreements that lead to lasting protection of the natural world, but resorts to violence if it is the most effective way to enforce such protection.

Challenge: An order of the Green cavalier can't issue a challenge against any creature of the animal or plant type. Whenever he issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has. If the target of his challenge is of the aberration or undead type, each round he can roll his first attack roll against the target creature twice and take the higher result.

Skills: An order of the Green cavalier gains Knowledge (nature) and Survival as class skills. In addition, whenever an order of the Green cavalier attempts a Survival check to track foes of the aberration or undead type, he receives a bonus on the check equal to half his cavalier level (minimum +1).

Order Abilities: A cavalier belonging to the order of the Green gains the following abilities.

Favored Terrain (Ex): At 2nd level, an order of the Green cavalier chooses a favored terrain from the list of <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger favored terrains</a>. He gains this as a favored terrain, as the ranger class feature of the same name. At 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter, he selects another favored terrain. In addition, at each such interval, the skill bonus in any one favored terrain (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

Cut the Corruption (Su): At 8th level, an order of the Green cavalier can touch a weapon and enhance it as a free action once per day. For 1 minute, the weapon glows with a deep-green light and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage against aberrations and undead. This damage does not stack with the additional damage granted by the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">bane</a> weapon special ability. At 16th level, the cavalier can use this ability a second time each day.

End of the Cycle (Su): At 15th level, things killed by an order of the Green cavalier tends to stay dead. When the cavalier kills a creature, it is treated as if it were killed by a death effect for the purposes of magic that can restore it to life. In addition, it's placed under the effects of a permanent <a href="spelldisplayfc05.html?ItemName=sanctify%20corpse">sanctify corpse</a> effect (using the cavalier's level as the spell's caster level).
