Your magical power taps into pure anarchy.

Associated Bloodline: Protean.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you fail a concentration check to cast a spell, a cantrip effect is created. Randomly determine one of your cantrips known (for example, if you know 6 cantrips, roll 1d6). There is a 50% chance this cantrip affects a target of your choice within 60 feet; otherwise it affects you.

Bloodline Powers: Raw magical energy lashes out when you destroy or negate hostile spells.

Wild Feedback (Su): At 3rd level, when you successfully dispel or counterspell an opponent's spell, the caster (if it is within 100 feet) takes 1d6 points of damage +1 per level of the spell affected. This bloodline power replaces protean resistances.
