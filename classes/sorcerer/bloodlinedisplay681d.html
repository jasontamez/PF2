You have in your veins the ever-changing wildness of primal chaos, the raw essence of unbound creation. Your mind and spirit burst with the constant inspiration of consummate freedom, though you have difficulty following through on a task when another, new and exciting, catches your interest.

Class Skill: Knowledge (planes).

Bonus Spells: entropic shield (3rd), blur (5th), gaseous form (7th), confusion (9th), major creation (11th), disintegrate (13th), greater polymorph (15th), polymorph any object (17th), shapechange (19th).

Bonus Feats: Agile Maneuvers, Defensive Combat Training, Enlarge Spell, Great Fortitude, Improved Great Fortitude, Skill Focus (Craft [any]), Spell Focus, Toughness.

Bloodline Arcana: Your magic of creation and changing is hard to unravel. The DC to dispel transmutation or conjuration (creation) spells that you cast is increased by +4.

Bloodline Powers: Your ancestral immersion in primordial chaos begets your curiously warped magical talents.

Protoplasm (Sp): At 1st level, you can create a ball of entropic protoplasm and hurl it at targets within 30 feet. This protoplasm acts as a tanglefoot bag that also inflicts 1 point of acid damage per round to a creature entangled by it. The protoplasm dissolves within 1d3 rounds. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Protean Resistances (Ex): At 3rd level, you gain resist acid 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against polymorph, petrification, and transmutation spells or effects. At 9th level, you gain resist acid 10 and your save bonus increases to +4.

Reality Wrinkle (Sp): At 9th level, you can surround yourself with a mobile, 10-foot-radius emanation of mutable reality. This rippling distortion is similar to solid fog but does not provide concealment or block line of sight. Your movement is not slowed by this aura. Attacks from outside the aura suffer a 20% miss chance against targets inside the aura. You may use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level, though this duration need not be continuous.

Spatial Tear (Sp): At 15th level, once per day, you can unravel the fibers of reality and ride along them as they snap back into place. This power functions as dimension door, while also creating a mass of black tentacles centered on your former location. Both of these effects use your sorcerer level as the caster level. At 20th level, you can use this ability twice per day.

Avatar of Chaos (Ex): At 20th level, you are infused with the essence of raw chaos. You gain immunity to acid, petrification, and polymorph effects (except when cast on self), as well as a +2 bonus to save DCs and on checks to overcome spell penetration against creatures with the lawful subtype.
