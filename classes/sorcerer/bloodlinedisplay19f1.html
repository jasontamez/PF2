The deep forests of Avistan, such as those found in Molthune and Nirmathas, are a haven for one of Golarion's most fabled creatures: <a href="monsterdisplay19f1.html?ItemName=Unicorn">unicorns</a>. Deeply empathetic and fiercely protective, unicorns on occasion form close bonds with humans, often young and noble-hearted women. When the two have a particularly strong bond, the unicorn's magic can become a part of the bonded human, and sometimes is even passed on to her children. These children, blessed by their parent's connection to that force of true good, grow up to become sorcerers of the unicorn bloodline.

Bloodline Arcana: Every time you cast a spell, you can restore a number of hit points equal to double the level of the spell you cast to one target of your choice that you can see. A creature at its maximum hit points cannot be affected by this ability. Healing a dying creature with this ability does not automatically stabilize the creature unless its hit points are brought to 0 or above.

Bloodline Powers: Your connection to the unicorns' blessing shapes you as you grow, empowering you with the forces of good and restoration.

Safekeeping (Su): At 1st level, you can touch a creature as a standard action, granting it a +2 insight bonus to AC for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Pure of Mind (Su): At 3rd level, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm effects and a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells with the evil descriptor. At 9th level, your bonus on saving throws against charm effects increases to +4 and your bonus on saving throws against spells with the evil descriptor increases to +6.

Righteous Fury (Su): At 9th level, once per day you can create a spear of pure light and throw it at a creature within 60 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack that uses your Charisma modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier to determine the attack bonus. The spear deals 1d6 points of damage per sorcerer level and ignores all damage reduction and hardness. This damage increases to 1d8 points of damage per sorcerer level against an evil creature. At 13th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability three times per day.

Friend to Nature (Su): At 15th level, creatures with the animal or magical beast type and a nonevil alignment instinctually trust you. Such creatures automatically have a starting attitude of indifferent or better toward you unless you or a creature allied with you has attacked or otherwise threatened violence against such a creature.

Blessing (Su): At 20th level, you gain immunity to poison, to charm effects, and to spells and weapons with the evil descriptor. You can also cast <a href="spelldisplay876d.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20evil">magic circle against evil</a> at will with a caster level equal to your sorcerer level.
