</tr><tr style="background-color:#CCCCCC;">
<td><a href="bloodlinedisplay92d2.html?ItemName=Aquatic">Aquatic</a></td><td>Your family traces its heritage back to the ocean depths, whether scions of undersea empires left in the wake of nomadic sea-tribes, or the spawn of creeping ichthyic infiltrators into remote seaside villages. </td>
