You are descended from the ranks of noble marids, making your blood royal as well as magical.

Associated Bloodline: Marid.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with the water descriptor, you gain a swim speed of 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to double the level of the spell cast.

Bloodline Powers: Your mastery over water is coupled with the power to alter it.

Sweeping Waves (Su): At 15th level, you can summon a wave of water from within, which pours from your mouth and violently sweeps creatures away from you on all sides. Creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed at a Ref lex save (the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or take a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + 1 per 2 sorcerer levels you possess. Additionally, the waves of water bull rush each affected creature, using your caster level as your base attack bonus and your Charisma modifier as your Strength modifier to determine the CMB of the bull rush. A successful save halves the damage and negates the bull rush. This bloodline power replaces elemental movement.
