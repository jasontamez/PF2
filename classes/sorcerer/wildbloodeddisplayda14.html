Some plant magic is more green, while some is more brown, like hardwood.

Associated Bloodline: Verdant.

Bloodline Arcana: Your powers of compulsion can affect even plant creatures. Whenever you cast a mind-affecting or language-dependent spell, it affects creatures of the plant type as if they were humanoids that understood your language.

Bloodline Powers: Your nature powers create tough, resilient minions.

Lush Summoning (Su): At 3rd level, whenever you summon creatures with a conjuration (summoning) spell, you can decide that they appear green and leafy. The natural armor bonus of such creatures is increased by +2, and they gain a +4 bonus on saves against paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning. This bloodline power replaces photosynthesis.
