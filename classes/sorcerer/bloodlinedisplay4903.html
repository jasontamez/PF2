Class Skill: Knowledge (history).

Bonus Spells: alarm (3rd), blur (5th), protection from energy (7th), freedom of movement (9th), break enchantment (11th), mislead (13th), spell turning (15th), moment of prescience (17th), foresight (19th).

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with a range of "personal," you gain a luck bonus equal to the spell's level on all your saving throws for 1 round.

Bloodline Powers: You are destined for great things, and the powers that you gain serve to protect you.

Touch of Destiny (Sp): At 1st level, you can touch a creature as a standard action, giving it an insight bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Fated (Su): Starting at 3rd level, you gain a +1 luck bonus on all of your saving throws and to your AC during surprise rounds (see Combat) and when you are otherwise unaware of an attack. At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 19th level.

It Was Meant To Be (Su): At 9th level, you may reroll any one attack roll, critical hit confirmation roll, or level check made to overcome spell resistance. You must decide to use this ability after the first roll is made but before the results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 9th level, you can use this ability once per day. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day.

Within Reach (Su): At 15th level, your ultimate destiny is drawing near. Once per day, when an attack or spell that causes damage would result in your death, you may attempt a DC 20 Will save. If successful, you are instead reduced to -1 hit points and are automatically stabilized. The bonus from your fated ability applies to this save.

Destiny Realized (Su): At 20th level, your moment of destiny is at hand. Any critical threats made against you only confirm if the second roll results in a natural 20 on the die. Any critical threats you score with a spell are automatically confirmed. Once per day, you can automatically succeed at one caster level check made to overcome spell resistance. You must use this ability before making the roll.
