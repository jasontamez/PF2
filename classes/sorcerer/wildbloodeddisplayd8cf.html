Your magic is more focused on the power of air and rain than on lightning and thunder.

Associated Bloodline: Stormborn.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever outdoors during any form of precipitation, your effective caster level is increased by 2.

Bloodline Powers: The greatest storms bring ruin through wind, not electricity.

Windcaller (Sp): At 9th level, you can call the winds to obey your commands for 1 minute per level. This functions like control winds, except that you may choose to be immune to any increased wind effects you create. The ability's duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. This bloodline power replaces thunderbolt.
