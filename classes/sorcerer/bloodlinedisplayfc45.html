Psychic power runs thorough your blood, whether it be from a familial predisposition to psychic power or exposure to a powerful psychic phenomenon. Whatever the source of this power, your mind is a dangerous weapon.

Class Skill: Sense Motive.

Bonus Spells: mind thrust I (3rd), id insinuation I (5th), ego whip I (7th), intellect fortress I (9th), psychic crush I (11th), mental barrier V (13th), tower of iron will III (15th), bilocation (17th), microcosm (19th).

Bonus Feats: Focused Spell, Heighten Spell, Intuitive Spell, Iron Will, Logical Spell, Persuasive, Quicken Spell, Skill Focus (Sense Motive), Spell Focus.

Bloodline Arcana: Your sorcerer spells and spell-like abilities count as psychic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components instead of verbal and somatic components when casting your spells.

Bloodline Powers: Your psychic powers make you a master mentalist, but your soul struggles with the urge to transcend into a pure thought-form.

Psychic Strike (Su): At 1st level, you can overwhelm the minds of those nearby. You can target one creature within 30 feet that you can see; that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or it takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess and becomes shaken for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Mental Resistance (Ex): At 3rd level, your mind blocks attempts to assail it. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. At 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.

Undercasting Prodigy (Sp): Starting at 9th level, whenever you gain a new level of spells, you automatically replace any psychic bloodline spells that can be undercast with the highest-level version you can cast in your list of spells known. For example, at 9th level, you would replace mind thrust I, id insinuation I, and ego whip I with mind thrust IV, id insinuation III, and ego whip II, respectively, as spells known.

Thoughtsense (Sp): At 15th level, you can detect the thoughts of others around you, as a constant thoughtsense effect with a range of 30 feet instead of 60 feet.

True Thought-Form (Sp): At 20th level, you can shed the restrictions of the flesh and become a thoughtform-a being that exists independently of its substance. Whenever a creature would kill you, you can attempt to use mind swap against that creature as an immediate action just before dying.
