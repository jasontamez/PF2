The alien taint in your blood causes malformations and mutations in others.

Associated Bloodline: Aberrant.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell of the polymorph subschool, one target of your choice may receive one random effect from the Warped Polymorph Benefits table (see below). This bonus lasts as long as the polymorph effect on the target.

Bloodline Powers: Your strange blood brings out the worst in people.

Warp Touch (Sp): Starting at 1st level, you create brief, disorienting changes in a creature's physical form. This ability affects one creature within 30 feet, which is dazed for 1 round (Fortitude negates; DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This bloodline power replaces acidic ray.
