Your nature is to gather the darkness into yourself.

Associated Bloodline: Shadow.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell in an area of dim light or darkness, your effective caster level is increased by 1.

Bloodline Powers: Your shadow magic is more defensive than offensive.

Cloak of Shadows (Sp): At 1st level, as a standard action, you can grant one target a cloak of shadows. This cloak gives the target a bonus on Stealth checks made in areas of dim or no light equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level for 1 round per 2 sorcerer levels you possess (minimum +1 bonus for 1 round). You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This bloodline power replaces shadowstrike.
