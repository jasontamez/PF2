Your powers were born of malevolent trickery and shadowy First World magic.

Associated Bloodline: Fey.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with the curse subtype, increase the spell's DC by 2.

Bloodline Powers: In your presence, senses are deceived.

Fey Fascination (Su): At 1st level, as a standard action, you can force one target within 30 feet to make a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or be fascinated for 1 round for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting, illusion (pattern) effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This bloodline power replaces laughing touch.
