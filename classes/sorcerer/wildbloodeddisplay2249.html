The powers of the Abyss can vary radically, even for similar fiends.

Associated Bloodline: Abyssal.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell that deals hit point damage, one target of your choice affected by the spell takes 2 additional hit points of damage. This ability has no effect on spells that do not deal hit point damage (such as ability score damage).

Bloodline Powers: Flight is often the key to survival.

Wings of the Abyss (Su): At 9th level, you can sprout leathery wings and fly for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level, with a speed of 60 feet and good maneuverability. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. This bloodline power replaces strength of the abyss.
