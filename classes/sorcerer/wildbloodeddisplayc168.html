One of your ancestors was unjustly executed, and your soul is infused with this forebear's vengeful spirit.

Associated Bloodline: Martyred.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever a creature damages you, until the end of your next turn if you apply a metamagic feat to a spell that targets that creature, reduce the spell level increase of that metamagic feat by 1 (minimum 0).

Bloodline Powers: You never forgive those who wrong you.

Vengeful Strike (Su): At 9th level, once per day after a foe has damaged you in melee, as an immediate action you can deal the same amount and type of damage to your foe (maximum amount of damage equal to double your character level). At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. This bloodline power replaces gift of blood.
