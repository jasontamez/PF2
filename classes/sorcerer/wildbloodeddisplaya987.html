Your soul is infused with the restorative and life-giving powers of elemental water.

Associated Bloodline: Elemental (water).

Bloodline Arcana: Anytime you cast a spell with the cold or water descriptor, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the level of the spell cast. You can grant up to half of these temporary hit points to an adjacent ally, in which case you gain the remaining temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last 1 minute.

Bloodline Powers: Your powers are revitalizing rather than destructive.

Lifewater Stream (Su): At 9th level, once per day, you can unleash a surge of restorative elemental water that aids your allies. This ability affects creatures in a 30-foot line extending from your palm, and you can select one of the following conditions to remove from the affected creatures: fatigued, shaken, or sickened. Creatures affected by a more extreme version of the chosen condition (such as exhausted for fatigued, frightened for shaken, and nauseated for sickened) have their condition reduced to the less extreme version. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day, and you can choose from the following additional conditions: blinded, deafened, dazed, and staggered. At 20th level, you can use this ability three times per day. This bloodline power replaces elemental blast.
