Revelations: An oracle with the Reaper mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.

Death's Embrace (Su): You gain <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a> as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet its prerequisites. Once per round when you succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check, you can deal 1d6 points of negative energy damage to the target of your grapple. This damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, to a maximum of 5d6 at 20th level.

Haunt Channeler (Su): You gain the <a href="classdisplay0c62.html?ItemName=Medium">medium's haunt channeler</a> class feature with an effective medium level equal to your oracle level -2. You must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.

Moral Crisis (Su): As a standard action, you can target a living creature within 30 feet of you, reminding it of its moral failings. The target must succeed at a Will save or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. The target can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.

Obliterate Memory (Sp): As a standard action, you can target a creature within 30 feet and eliminate all memory of an event the target experienced, as <a href="spelldisplayea0c-2.html?ItemName=modify%20memory">modify memory</a>. A target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. In addition, you can cause an account of the memory erased by this ability to appear on a blank page of any book you are carrying. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 15th level. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

Pale Horse (Sp): You can summon a <a href="spelldisplay1cee.html?ItemName=phantom%20steed">phantom steed</a>, as the spell, to serve you for a number of hours per day equal to your oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments. You must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.

Return to Dust (Su): You call upon the inexorable ravages of time and entropy to damage an object or undead creature within 30 feet, dealing 1d6 points of damage per 2 oracle levels you have, ignoring hardness and damage reduction. If used against an undead creature or an object in another creature's possession, the undead creature or the creature possessing the object can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Spectral Spells (Su): You gain <a href="featdisplaya702.html?ItemName=Ectoplasmic%20Spell">Ectoplasmic Spell</a> as a bonus feat. In addition, once per day, you can cast a spell with the <a href="featdisplaya702.html?ItemName=Ectoplasmic%20Spell">Ectoplasmic Spell</a> metamagic feat as a standard action that does not increase the level of the spell. You can use this ability one additional time per day at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

Spirit Touch (Su): As a standard action, you can touch one weapon to grant it the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> special ability for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, you can spend two uses of this ability to grant it the ghost touch and <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">undead bane</a> special abilities. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Terminal Aura (Su): You gain an aura with a 10-foot radius; any creature within that has fewer than 0 hit points but is stable must succeed at a Will save or be affected by the spell <a href="spelldisplay685f.html?ItemName=bleed">bleed</a>. A dying creature within range of this aura does not receive a Constitution check to stabilize unless it succeeds at a Will save, but it can still be healed as normal. A creature with fast healing or regeneration must also succeed at a Will save every round or that ability does not function for 1 round. You can suppress and resume this aura as a free action. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

True Death (Su): Those slain by your spells or by one of your attacks that deals negative energy becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring such a creature back from the dead using <a href="spelldisplay0d07.html?ItemName=raise%20dead">raise dead</a> or similar magic must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + your oracle level or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. A successful casting of <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> (DC = 10 + your oracle level) before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead suppresses this effect for 1 minute.

Final Revelation: Upon 20th level, you are a true reaper of death and no soul can escape your sight. You automatically confirm critical hits and creatures automatically fail Fortitude saves against your coup de grace attempts. In addition, you can notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if you had the blindsense ability. This sense does not allow you to detect objects, but it does allow you to notice living things that are not creatures.
