Rage Powers - Barbarian









Barbarian Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.



Skald Rage Powers

At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32-34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the inf luence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).

Elemental Rage Powers

The following rage powers can be selected by any barbarian or skald who is at least 6th level and has the elemental stance (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 10), lesser elemental rage, or lesser elemental blood rage power. A barbarian or skald can use only one of these rage powers at a time, and an unchained barbarian must adopt the elemental stance to do so.

<tr>
<td>Aryzul's Curse (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ng0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Planes-of-Power">Planes of Power pg. 8</a>): When raging, the barbarian emanates a 5-foot-radius aura of radioactivity. Each round that another creature begins its turn within this aura, it takes a cumulative -2 penalty to Strength (Fortitude negates, DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + her Constitution modifier) for the duration of the rage. A creature's Strength penalty from this ability cannot exceed the barbarian's class level. At 12th level, the barbarian can choose to create a 10-foot-radius aura of radioactivity when she begins her rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Hshurha's Veil (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ng0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Planes-of-Power">Planes of Power pg. 8</a>): When raging, the barbarian can use Stealth, and she gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her barbarian level on Stealth checks plus the benefits of concealment against ranged attacks and attacks of opportunity.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Kelizandri's Tide (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ng0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Planes-of-Power">Planes of Power pg. 8</a>): When the barbarian rages, enemies find it difficult to escape the vortex of her fury. As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can attempt a single combat maneuver check against each creature within 10 feet of her. If her roll equals or exceeds a creature's CMD, she moves that creature 5 feet closer to her. Once per day after attempting this maneuver, she can attack each adjacent creature as a free action as if using the <a href="featdisplay1c0a.html?ItemName=Whirlwind%20Attack">Whirlwind Attack</a> feat. If she has the <a href="featdisplay1c0a.html?ItemName=Whirlwind%20Attack">Whirlwind Attack</a> feat, she can also use it as a free action in this way one additional time per day.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ymeri's Pyre (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ng0?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Planes-of-Power">Planes of Power pg. 8</a>): The barbarian visibly burns with an inner flame that consumes all impurities affecting her. Each round that the barbarian rages reduces the duration of negative spells and effects inflicted upon her as if 2 rounds had passed; this has no effect on the duration of such effects against other creatures. Once per day, the barbarian can expend 5 rounds of rage to attempt a new saving throw against each nonpermanent effect currently affecting her. Each successful saving throw ends the related effect, and she can choose not to make a save against an effect.</td>
