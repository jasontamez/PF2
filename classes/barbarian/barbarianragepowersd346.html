Defensive Rage Powers


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Clear Mind (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 32</a>): A barbarian may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The barbarian must take the second result, even if it is worse. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power. This power can only be used once per rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Deathless Frenzy (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy91dq?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Moon">Blood of the Moon pg. 13</a>):  While raging, you ignore the effects of being at 0 or fewer hit points until you have been at 0 or fewer hit points for 1 round, at which point the appropriate consequences for your current hit point total take effect. Even death can be postponed this way, potentially allowing you to survive if you receive sufficient healing before the round is up. You must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Eater of Magic (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 27</a>):  Once per rage, when a barbarian fails a saving throw against a spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability, she can reroll the saving throw against the effect (this is not an action). If she succeeds at the second saving throw, she is not affected by the spell, supernatural ability, or spell-like ability and gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the effect's caster level (in the case of spell or spell-like abilities) or the CR of the effect's creator (in the case of supernatural abilities). These temporary hit points last until damage is applied to them or 1 minute, whichever occurs first. A barbarian must have the superstition rage power and be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Energy Absorption (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack of her chosen energy type once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it, instead gaining 1 temporary hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have inflicted. These temporary hit points last until the end of the barbarian's rage. A barbarian must have the greater energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Energy Resistance (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected and it cannot be changed. This rage power can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time is applies to a different energy type.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Energy Resistance, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  Once per rage, a barbarian can reduce damage by half from a single attack against which she has energy resistance (halve the damage, then apply resistance). A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Fearless Rage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): While raging, the barbarian is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions. A barbarian must be at least 12th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Feast of Blood (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywa?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Demon-Hunters-Handbook">Demon Hunter's Handbook pg. 8</a>):  While raging, the barbarian may feast on the organs of her foes and absorb their power. After successfully ripping out a creature's vital organ, the barbarian may eat the organ within 1 minute of extracting it as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once the organ is consumed, the barbarian recovers a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the organ's owner. In addition, the barbarian gains any energy immunities or resistances the victim had, though the effectiveness of these resistances is halved (for instance, a barbarian who eats the heart of a creature with resist cold 10 would gain resist cold 5; energy immunities are reduced to resist energy 20). This energy resistance lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the Hit Dice of the creature whose organ was consumed. A barbarian must have the bloody fist rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 14th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Flesh Wound (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  Once per rage, the barbarian can try to avoid serious harm from an attack. The barbarian must make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to the damage that would be dealt by the attack. The barbarian's armor check penalty applies on this saving throw. If the save succeeds, the barbarian takes half damage from the attack and the damage is nonlethal. The barbarian must elect to use this ability after the attack roll is made, but before the damage is rolled. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ghost Rager (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 27</a>): While raging, the barbarian deals normal damage to incorporeal creatures even when using nonmagical weapons.
She also gains a +3 morale bonus to touch AC, which increases by 1 at 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter (to a maximum of +7 at 20th level). This can't raise her touch AC above her full AC.. A barbarian must be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Good for What Ails You (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian who takes a drink of alcohol may attempt a new saving throw against one of the following conditions that may be affecting her: blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or sickened. If she succeeds at the save, the effect is suppressed for the duration of the rage. She also may attempt a new saving throw if poisoned; a successful save counts against those required for a cure, but a failed save has no ill effect. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Guarded Life (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, if the barbarian is reduced below 0 hit points, 1 hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. If the barbarian is at negative hit points due to lethal damage, she immediately stabilizes. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Guarded Life, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 27</a>):  When using the guarded life rage power, 1 additional hit point of lethal damage per barbarian level is converted to nonlethal damage. A barbarian must have the guarded life rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</td>

This bonus increases by +1 for every 6 levels the barbarian has attained. Activating this ability is a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Increased Damage Reduction (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian's damage reduction increases by 1/-.

</tr><tr></td>Inured to the Dead (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01ws3">Pathfinder #139: The Dead Road pg. 67</a>): Once per rage, when the barbarian fails a saving throw against an effect created by an undead creature, she can reroll the saving throw. She must use the second result, even if it is worse. This does not require spending an action. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Liquid Courage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian increases her morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects by +1 for each alcoholic drink she consumes during her rage, to a maximum of +1 increase per four barbarian levels. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Reflexive Dodge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 27</a>):  While using her rolling dodge rage power, the barbarian may apply her dodge bonus to AC as a bonus on Reflex saving throws.

</tr><tr></td>Renewed Life (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  While raging, the barbarian ignores the effect of one temporary negative level per four barbarian levels she has (maximum 5). Once per day, when a barbarian with temporary negative levels ends her rage, she can attempt saving throws to remove a number of negative levels equal to the number of levels she could ignore while raging. A barbarian must have the renewed vitality rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</td>

Once per day, when a barbarian with ability penalties or damage ends her rage, she can reroll a saving throw, if any, against an effect that imposed an ability penalty or dealt her ability damage. If successful, she removes an amount of ability penalty or damage equal to the amount she can ignore while raging. A barbarian must have the renewed vigor rage power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
