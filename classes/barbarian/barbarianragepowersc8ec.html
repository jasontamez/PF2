Totem Rage Powers

Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat</a>
Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power (see the Advanced Player's Guide) cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with "dragon totem" in its title).
Note: The <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5ldw0?The-FAQ-That-Time-Forgot">FAQ</a> clarifies that the Totem Warrior line for this description was removed, the restriction on only taking totem rage powers from one group is still in place.

She also doubles her world serpent totem insight bonus to AC against attack rolls made by an outsider or aberration to confirm a critical hit against her. A barbarian must have the world serpent totem and world serpent totem spirit rage powers and be at least 10th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
