**Cavalier**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 32</a>
While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering banner. The cavalier's true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.

**Role**: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of social situations.

**Alignment**: Any.
**Hit Die**: d10.
**Starting Wealth**: 5d6 x 10 gp (average 175 gp).

**Class Skills**

The Cavalier's class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).

**Skill Points at each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency**: Cavaliers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and with shields (except tower shields).

**Challenge (Ex)**: Once per day, a cavalier can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, the cavalier chooses one target within sight to challenge. The cavalier's melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier's level. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.

Challenging a foe requires much of the cavalier's concentration. The cavalier takes a -2 penalty to his Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of his challenge.

The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Each cavalier's challenge also includes another effect which is listed in the section describing the cavalier's order.

**Mount (Ex)**: A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a <a href="classdisplay4c10.html?ItemName=Companion">druid's animal companion</a>, using the cavalier's level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. This mount may come from the following list:

**Medium Cavaliers**: <a href="druidcompanions6014.html?ItemName=Axe%20Beak">Axe Beak</a>, <a href="druidcompanions5a78.html?ItemName=Camel">Camel</a>, <a href="druidcompanionse519.html?ItemName=Elk">Elk</a>, <a href="druidcompanions650a.html?ItemName=Giraffe">Giraffe</a>, <a href="druidcompanions9d65.html?ItemName=Horse">Horse</a>, <a href="druidcompanionsfdfa.html?ItemName=Seahorse,%20Giant">Seahorse, Giant</a>, <a href="druidcompanions8e00.html?ItemName=Tortoise,%20Giant">Tortoise, Giant</a>, <a href="druidcompanions2c59.html?ItemName=Zebra">Zebra</a>
**Small Cavaliers**: <a href="druidcompanionsf593.html?ItemName=Antelope">Antelope</a>, <a href="druidcompanionsea21.html?ItemName=Boar">Boar</a> (requires 4th level), <a href="druidcompanions4805.html?ItemName=Capybara">Capybara</a>, <a href="druidcompanions0af5.html?ItemName=Dog">Dog</a> (requires 4th level), <a href="druidcompanions789f.html?ItemName=Kangaroo">Kangaroo</a>, <a href="druidcompanions5167.html?ItemName=Lizard%20(Giant%20Gecko)">Lizard (Giant Gecko)</a>, <a href="druidcompanions59b4.html?ItemName=Pony">Pony</a>, <a href="druidcompanions0901.html?ItemName=Ram">Ram</a>, <a href="druidcompanions2bc5.html?ItemName=Reindeer">Reindeer</a>, <a href="druidcompanions0df8.html?ItemName=Stag">Stag</a>, <a href="druidcompanionsc12b.html?ItemName=Weasel,%20Giant">Weasel, Giant</a>, <a href="druidcompanions53e5.html?ItemName=Wolf">Wolf</a>, <a href="druidcompanions39a6.html?ItemName=Wolfdog">Wolfdog</a>

The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.

A cavalier does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with <a href="featdisplayf816.html?ItemName=Armor%20Proficiency,%20Light">Light Armor Proficiency</a> as a bonus feat. A cavalier's mount does not gain the share spells special ability.

A cavalier's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a cavalier's mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level.

**Order (Ex)**: At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

**Tactician (Ex)**: At 1st level, a cavalier receives a <a href="feats0beb.html?Category=Teamwork">teamwork feat</a> as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, the cavalier can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.

**Cavalier's Charge (Ex)**: At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while mounted.

**Expert Trainer (Ex)**: At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train mounts with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses Handle Animal on an animal that serves as a mount. In addition, he can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC.

**Banner (Ex)**: At 5th level, a cavalier's banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier's banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.

**Bonus Feat**: At 6th level, and at every six levels thereafter, a cavalier gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The cavalier must meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats.

**Greater Tactician (Ex)**: At 9th level, the cavalier receives an additional <a href="feats0beb.html?Category=Teamwork">teamwork feat</a> as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Using the tactician ability is a swift action.

**Mighty Charge (Ex)**: At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range of any weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, the cavalier can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Demanding Challenge (Ex)**: At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a -2 penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.

**Greater Banner (Ex)**: At 14th level, the cavalier's banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day.

**Master Tactician (Ex)**: At 17th level, the cavalier receives an additional <a href="feats0beb.html?Category=Teamwork">teamwork feat</a> as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier uses the tactician ability, he grants any two teamwork feats that he knows. He can select from any of his teamwork feats, not just his bonus feats.

**Supreme Charge (Ex)**: At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the cavalier's base attack bonus.

**Alternate Capstones**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 28</a>
When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.


**Great Beast (Su)**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 31</a>
At 20th level, the character's animal companion is a paragon of its kind—a hero and legend in its own right. The animal companion's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom scores each increase by 4. This capstone is available to any class with an animal companion.


**Perfect Body, Flawless Mind (Ex)**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 31</a>
At 20th level, the character's endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability.


**Tactical Genius (Ex)**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 28</a>
At 20th level, the cavalier is a maestro of the battlefield, commanding and moving troops like so many game pieces. The cavalier gains a bonus <a href="feats0beb.html?Category=Teamwork">teamwork feat</a>, can grant up to three bonus feats with tactician, and increases the range of tactician by 90 feet.


**The Boss (Ex)**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 30</a>
At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero—she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability.


**With This Sword (Ex)**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 31</a>
At 20th level, the character's blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has—preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability.


**Won't Stay Dead (Ex)**

**Source** <a href="../external.html?link=https://paizo.com/products/btq01yji?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Chronicle-of-Legends">Chronicle of Legends pg. 31</a>
At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability.
