Sagas - Skald









Skald Sagas


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2u?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Magic-Tactics-Toolbox">Magic Tactics Toolbox</a>
Sagas are a form of lore-keeping and tale-telling common in Irrisen and the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Specialized applications of a skald's raging song ability, sagas function much like bardic masterpieces (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 21) but are available only to skalds. Sagas are never purely artistic constructs; they are designed to preserve lore or commemorate historical figures, and are usually based in fact. Sagas therefore require ranks in Knowledge (history) as a prerequisite, as well. Bards can learn sagas, using their bardic performance ability instead of raging song.
