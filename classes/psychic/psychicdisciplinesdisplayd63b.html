By collecting expert information and reading all sorts of treatises and chapbooks on occult subjects, you learn proper techniques and rituals to empower your mental abilities. Your abilities become stronger through study and science, not instinct.

Discipline Powers: Your powers relate to your extensive knowledge and your ability to alter and adapt your memory.

Illuminating Answers (Su): You can glean deeper truths from advice you magically obtain, even if the information itself is specious. When you use a spell or spell-like ability that allows you to get answers to questions (such as augury, blood biography, or contact other plane) and get at least one answer, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You regain this point even if the answer is false or vague. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Mnemonic Cache (Su): You can memorize a piece of information and later recall it perfectly. Your mnemonic cache can hold roughly 10 pages of written information, including images and maps, or 30 minutes' worth of speech or music. (Memorizing music doesn't confer the ability to perform it properly.) The amount you can store increases by 5 pages and 5 minutes at 2nd level, and at every psychic level thereafter. You can hold only one piece of information in your mnemonic cache at a time. The information doesn't go away when you recall it, but when you put a new piece of information in the cache, the old piece becomes as imperfect any other memory. Memorizing magical writing (such as a scroll or a page from a spellbook) doesn't confer the ability to borrow, duplicate, or retain any of the magic in the writing. You could reproduce the spell in writing to allow someone who prepares spells from a spellbook to prepare it, though this functions as using a borrowed spellbook for anyone other than you. If you're in telepathic contact with another creature (through telepathic bond, for example), you can transfer the information directly into its mind as a free action. For this creature, the information functions like a normal memory, not one with perfect clarity.

You can attempt to sequester a written magical trap (such as explosive runes or sepia snake sigil) in your mnemonic cache and destroy it. Treat this as a Disable Device check to disarm a magical trap (as though you had the trapfinding class feature). Your bonus on this roll is equal to either your Disable Device modifier or the sum of 5 + your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher. If you succeed, instead of being disabled, the trap is erased and destroyed. This ability can't destroy symbol traps; it functions only if written text is involved.

Superior Automatic Writing (Ex): At 5th level, when attempting checks for the automatic writing occult skill unlock (see page 194), you can treat your psychic level + your Wisdom bonus as your number of Linguistics skill ranks. At 8th level, you gain an additional option when using automatic writing, and can attempt a DC 35 check to gain information as though you-d used commune instead of augury or divination. This type of commune requires no material component, and the duration equals 1 round per psychic class level you possess. You connect to a distant being of great intellect, a fragment of the Akashic Record (see page 244), or a similar bastion of knowledge instead of to a deity.

Memory Palace (Su): At 13th level, you mentally construct an extradimensional library to house mental constructs representing the volumes of lore you've studied. This ability functions as mage's magnificent mansion, with the following adjustments: the memory palace is limited in size to a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your psychic level; your memory palace doesn't contain any furniture other than bookcases and a few desks and sofas where you and your visitors can study; and there is no food within, though the memory palace does contain a number of unseen servants equal to 1/2 your psychic level, which function solely as librarians. The library keeps the same layout each time you summon it, though you can alter its appearance each time you gain a level or by spending 15 minutes concentrating. You can reshape the memory palace in your mind, so it doesn't need to currently be in effect for you to alter it. You can create your memory palace once per day.

Choose one type of Knowledge skill when you gain this ability. Consulting your memory palace gives anyone who studies within-including you-a +4 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks of that type, and the memory palace counts as an extensive library for people attempting Knowledge checks of that type untrained. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on checks with the chosen skill when you're not consulting the palace (including when the palace isn't in effect). At 14th level and at each additional level thereafter, choose another Knowledge skill to which your memory palace's library bonuses apply.
