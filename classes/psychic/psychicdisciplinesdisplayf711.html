You discover deeper and more powerful corners of your mind through journeys you make in your dreams. Your consciousness expands outward into other dreaming minds, allowing you to explore the psychic landscapes of unconsciousness or regions of nightmare and horror.

Discipline Powers: Your mind can powerfully influence dreaming consciousnesses.

Dream Leech (Su): While adjacent to a sleeping or unconscious creature, you can take a swift action to siphon that creature's dreams, thereby learning new things about your own mind. The creature can attempt a Will save to negate this effect; such creatures are never considered willing. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect. If the subject fails the save, you gain a +4 bonus on your next Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check against the subject within the next 24 hours, and you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but no more than once per hour and no more than once per creature per day.

Oneiromancy (Su): As a standard action, you can tamper with the minds of sleeping creatures. You plant a subconscious thought in a sleeping creature's mind by attempting a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the sleeping creature's attitude or request a service from it. If you succeed, when the creature wakes it behaves in the way you dictated with the normal restrictions for the Diplomacy or Intimidate skill. The target of oneiromancy remains unaware of this manipulation, though if you fail your Diplomacy check the subject might have its starting attitude toward you negatively impacted, as normal. You must be adjacent to the sleeping creature to use this ability. Alternatively, you can use this ability as part of the casting of dream, minor dream, or nightmare. In this case, the oneiromancy effect takes place when the spell is cast. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect.

Mind Heist (Sp): At 5th level, you can delve into the subconscious mind of a sleeping target. You can cast detect thoughts as a spell-like ability on any adjacent sleeping creature. Additionally, you can gain the benefit of detect thoughts on a target of your dream, minor dream, or nightmare spells as if you had studied the target for 3 rounds. If you cast dream scan (see page 166), you know whether you received false information from the dream. A successful Will save negates mind heist. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.

Waking Dream (Sp): At 13th level, as a standard action, you can take control of the body of a sleeping creature within 30 feet for 1 hour per level. This ability functions like magic jar, except that your soul travels directly into the sleeping target with no receptacle necessary and the target creature's consciousness remains dreaming and unaware of its body's actions. When waking dream ends or the host body is destroyed, you immediately wake up in your body regardless of the distance from the host body, provided your body hasn't been destroyed. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Creatures that don't dream are immune to this effect.
