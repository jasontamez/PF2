Faith

Your belief in a higher power fuels your psychic abilities. Whether your mental abilities truly come to you as a divine gift or are simply enhanced by the power of your belief, none can say. In many ways, you resemble a divine caster, and prayers often factor into your casting of psychic spells.

Discipline Powers: Your powers serve to protect or cure you and your allies.

Deity (Ex): At 1st level, choose a deity to worship. Your alignment must remain within one step of your deity's or you lose access to all this discipline's bonus spells and discipline powers.

Divine Energy: You can channel spell energy into cure or inflict spells. This ability functions similarly to the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, and the type of spells you can convert depends on your alignment in the same way. The cure or inflict spells don't count as being on your psychic spell list for the purposes of any other effects. Each day, you can convert up to one spell from each spell level you can cast. Each time you use this ability to convert a spell, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Resilience of the Faithful (Su): At 5th level, you gain a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels you possess beyond 5th.

Prayer Aura (Su): At 13th level, as a free action, you can extend an aura around you to bolster your allies and make your enemies less effective. You can use this aura for a number of rounds per day equal to your psychic level. These rounds don't need to be consecutive. This functions as the prayer spell, granting your allies a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks and imposing a -1 penalty on your enemies' rolls of those types. If you are chaotic, lawful, good, or evil, the penalty from your aura changes to -2 against creatures of an opposing alignment. The penalty doesn't change further for a creature that opposes you on two alignment axes (such as a chaotic evil creature fighting a lawful good psychic).
