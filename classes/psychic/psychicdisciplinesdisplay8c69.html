Discipline Powers: Your mastery of intricate rituals allows you to wield great power, given time.

Ritual Unity (Su): You receive a +2 bonus on all skill checks attempted as part of an occult ritual (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 208). When you take the aid another action to assist an ally with a skill check and succeed at a DC 20 check, you impart a +4 bonus to your ally instead. When you successfully aid an ally in this way, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.

Power from Pageantry (Su): When casting a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less, you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool to extend the casting time to 1 full round. If you do, the caster level and saving throw DC increase by 2.

Force of Habit (Su): At 5th level, you are so accustomed to complex tasks that you can maintain focus on multiple mental foci simultaneously. If you spend 1 point from your phrenic pool as you cast a psychic spell that requires concentration, you can maintain concentration on that spell as a swift action. In addition, you can cast other psychic spells while concentrating on that spell.

Unrivaled Focus (Su): At 13th level, your powers of concentration become unmatched. Whenever you attempt a concentration check, you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool to treat the result of your die roll as a 20. You must choose to use this ability before rolling the check.
