Discipline Powers: Through your psychic training, you can unleash the most animalistic portions of your subconscious, enhancing your senses and physical capabilities.

Enhanced Senses (Ex): Your mind can process sensory stimuli with exceptional efficiency, awakening you to a world most humanoids cannot comprehend. You gain scent as per the universal monster rule. You can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool as a standard action to amplify your sense of smell, gaining blindsense with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. At 11th level, your blindsense is continuously active, and you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool as a standard action to gain blindsight with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute.

Survival Instinct (Ex): Through sheer willpower, you can keep your body going longer than should be possible. You add your Wisdom bonus (minimum +1) to your Constitution score to determine the negative hit point total at which you die, and as a bonus on Constitution checks to become stable or regain consciousness.

Ferocity (Ex): At 5th level, you cling to life with increasing ferocity. You gain ferocity as per the universal monster rule. Whenever you have 0 hit points or negative hit points, you gain a +4 morale bonus to your Strength and Dexterity, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Fortitude saves. At 8th level, you are not staggered when you have 0 hit points or negative hit points, and you automatically stabilize when you have negative hit points.

Primal Fury (Su): At 13th level, you can unleash a more primal version of yourself as a free action. This functions as transformation, with the following exceptions. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your psychic level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You can end the effect as a free action. After using this ability, you are fatigued for a number of rounds equal to twice the number of rounds spent in primal fury. You cannot enter a new primal fury while fatigued or exhausted. If you fall unconscious, your primal fury immediately ends.
