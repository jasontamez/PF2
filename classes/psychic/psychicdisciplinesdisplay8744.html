You are innately tied to and can communicate with electronic machinery and similar technological objects, through which you can funnel your psychic power like flowing water. You can amplify and focus your psychic energies using the technology that surrounds you- even certain kinds of technology that might not be obvious to others.

Discipline Powers: Your powers relate to uniting technology with psychic energy.

Synergized Energy (Su): Whenever you use a battery (Technology Guide 39), a generator (Technology Guide 62), or the ability described in the psychic battery psi-tech discovery (see above) to restore charges to any piece of technological equipment, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in your phrenic pool in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Attune Implants (Su): Starting at 5th level, you can spend a full-round action once per day to harness and channel the power of your cybernetic implants into your psychic spellcasting. This increases the saving throw DCs of your psychic spells by 1, and the increase lasts a number of minutes equal to your psychic level. You must have at least one piece of cybertech (Technology Guide 35) implanted in you to use this ability. Additional implants do not increase the duration or the number of uses of this discipline ability.

Dominate Technology (Sp): At 13th level, you can meld your mind with a piece of technology and temporarily control it, even if you had no hand in creating it or anything like it. Once per day, you can target one construct with control construct (as per the spell), except the DC of the Spellcraft check each round to maintain control of the construct is equal to 15 + the construct's HD. If you must attempt opposed Spellcraft checks against the construct's creator, you take a -5 penalty on your Spellcraft checks while you concentrate on this ability.
