<a href="phrenicamplificationsdisplay7a58.html?ItemName=Defensive%20Prognostication">Defensive Prognostication</a> (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 61</a>): When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell's level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.
