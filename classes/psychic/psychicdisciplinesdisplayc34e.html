Discipline Powers: Your stable mind protects you and your allies.

Mental Placidity (Su): As an immediate action, you can gain a +2 bonus on a Will saving throw you are about to attempt. This bonus increases to +4 against an enchantment spell or effect. Any ally who attempts a saving throw against the same effect gains a +1 bonus on the Will save, or a +2 bonus if the effect is an enchantment. If you succeed at the saving throw, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Calming Presence (Su): At 5th level, you become a calming force. You can use calm emotions as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Purge Disquiet (Su): At 13th level, you can banish mental distress. You become immune to fear spells and effects and to the confused condition. As a standard action, you can choose a willing creature that is either within 30 feet or in telepathic contact with you. For 1 round per psychic level you possess, you suppress any fear effect or confused, cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken condition affecting that creature. You can suppress only one effect at a time with this ability, and choosing a new target ends the suppression for the character you previously chose.
