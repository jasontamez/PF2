Discipline Powers: Your powers allow you to cause and endure pain.

Painful Reminder (Su): As a swift action, you can cause an enemy to take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage if you dealt damage to that enemy with a spell since the start of your previous turn. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This damage increases to 2d6 at 8th level and to 3d6 at 15th level.

Power from Pain (Su): If your painful reminder deals at least 5 points of damage, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Live On (Sp): At 5th level, you can use lay on hands as though you were a paladin of 3 levels lower than your psychic level. You also gain access to mercies as though you were a paladin of 3 levels lower than your psychic level. You can target only yourself with lay on hands or mercies gained from this discipline. This stacks with lay on hands abilities gained from other sources.

Agonizing Wound (Su): At 13th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature, you can also make that creature frightened or sickened (your choice) for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. If you expend two uses of this ability, you can instead have the creature become dazed, nauseated, or panicked for 1 round. The creature can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting pain effect.
