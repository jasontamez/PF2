Your mind is forged from the most powerful memories of a multitude of lifetimes. You have fragmentary knowledge of your prior lives and can leverage the experience gained during these lifetimes into raw psychic power.

Discipline Powers: Your myriad lives inspire diverse exceptional abilities.

Past-Life Memories (Ex): You add a bonus equal to half your psychic level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge checks and can attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.

Mnemonic Esoterica (Ex): By reaching into the recesses of your past lives, you gain knowledge beyond that of most psychics. Select a single additional spellcasting class. Once per day when you prepare your spells, you can add one spell from this class's spell list to your spells known and class spell list for 24 hours. This spell must be 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast, and you cast it as if it were psychic magic (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 144). You can decide to change the spellcasting class from which you draw this spell each time you gain a new level.

Resurgence (Su): At 5th level when you would be reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by an attack, you can spend 2 points from your phrenic pool as an immediate action to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8 points of damage + your psychic level. At 10th level, this ability's healing increases to 3d8 + your psychic level. If this healing is insufficient to bring you above negative hit points, you are automatically stabilized. If you would still be killed by the amount of damage taken, you erupt with positive energy and heal all allies within 30-foot-radius burst for the amount you healed yourself.

Physical Regression (Sp): At 13th level, you can spend 2 points from your phrenic pool as a standard action once per day to take on the form of one of your previous incarnations. This ability functions as the polymorph spell, but its range is personal and its duration becomes 10 minutes per caster level.
