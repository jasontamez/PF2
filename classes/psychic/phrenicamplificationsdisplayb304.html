Telempathic Restoration - Phrenic Amplifications - Psychic







<a href="phrenicamplificationsdisplayb304.html?ItemName=Telempathic%20Restoration">Telempathic Restoration</a> (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 16</a>): When the psychic casts telepathic bond, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to remove the dazed, frightened, panicked, shaken, or stunned condition from one target of the bond. Doing so removes the status from the target of the linked spell, but applies it immediately (with any remaining duration) to the psychic.
