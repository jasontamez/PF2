You perceive the space between light and darkness, and draw power from it. Shadows conceal and protect you, while revealing the locations of those who dare to hide within them. Over time, you develop the ability to deny the warmth of light or life to your enemies.

Discipline Powers: Your powers give you authority over light and shadow.

Twilight Influence (Su): You can channel spell energy into spells drawn from the Darkness cleric domain. This ability functions similarly to the cleric's ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, but you instead spontaneously cast Darkness domain spells. The domain spells don't count as being on your psychic spell list for the purposes of any other effects (unless they are independently on your psychic spell list, such as blindness/deafness). Each day, you can convert up to one spell from each spell level you can cast. Each time you use this ability to convert a spell, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool. The maximum number of points you can regain in this way per day is equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Dark Defense (Su): At 5th level, light and darkness become your allies, moving around you to protect you from your enemies. You gain a +2 deflection bonus to Armor Class against any attack while you benefit from concealment against that attack. If you have full concealment from that attack, this deflection bonus increases to +4.

Adumbration (Su): At 13th level, shadows move to conceal you. You gain a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half your level. In addition, you can use the Stealth skill even while being observed and without cover or concealment, as long as you are within 10 feet of a shadow other than your own. You gain no benefit from adumbration in areas of bright light.
