Forging a close bond with other people brings out the best in you, making it easier for you to link your mind with theirs. Through bonding your psyche with another person, you're able to fill in your own mental gaps and develop new psychic powers.

Discipline Powers: Your powers meld several minds together, or allow you to more easily influence others.

Emotional Bond (Su): You can create an empathic link between yourself and your allies, allowing you to monitor their emotional states. Setting up the link requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted concentration from you and all subjects, who must remain within 10 feet of you. You can link with a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier. This bond lasts until the next time you regain your spells, or until you go unconscious or voluntarily end the bond as a free action. If the bond ends, you can establish a new bond at will with another 10 minutes of mutual concentration. This link allows you to monitor emotions, detecting when allies become angry, surprised, confused, fearful, or the like, but doesn't allow them to communicate specific details. You can also easily tell whether a subject is unconscious. If a subject dies or moves to a different plane than you, your bond with that creature is severed. The distance between you and the subjects doesn't affect the bond as long as you're on the same plane of existence. At 4th level, the bond also gives you the benefits of the status spell with all subjects of the emotional bond.

Emotional Push (Su): You can draw upon the intense power of your own emotions in desperate situations, and your allies can call upon you through your emotional link to protect themselves. When you or a subject of your emotional bond must attempt a saving throw, the person attempting the save can gain a bonus equal to your Charisma bonus on the save as an immediate action. This ability can be used once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 psychic levels you possess. Allies using this ability don't need your permission, since the emotional connection is so direct, though you know when one of the uses has been expended. If the ally's saving throw is successful, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.

Share Memory (Sp): At 5th level, you can use share memory at will, but only with a willing target.

Team Player (Ex): At 5th level and 13th level, you gain a bonus teamwork feat.

Shared Skill (Ex): At 13th level, each time you set up an emotional bond, you can choose one Intelligence- or Charisma-based skill from the list of psychic's class skills. Any subject of your bond can use your bonus instead of his own when attempting checks with that skill as long as the bond lasts.
