Psychedelia

You ingest hallucinogens to expand your mind. Experimentation and study show you which ones will have the greatest effect. Your psychedelic forays put you into a different mental space from others, and normal people don't really understand you.

Discipline Powers: You distort your own mind and perceptions, and can impress your altered states onto others.

Drug Resistance (Ex): When you ingest drugs, you take half as much ability damage (minimum 1). You also gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to avoid becoming addicted to a drug or to overcome being addicted (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 236).

Cognatogen (Su): Once per day, you can create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. When you imbibe a cognatogen, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 1 minute per psychic level. In addition, while the cognatogen is in effect, you take a -2 penalty to one of your physical ability scores. If the cognatogen enhances your Intelligence, it applies a penalty to your Strength. If it enhances your Wisdom, it applies a penalty to your Dexterity. If it enhances your Charisma, it applies a penalty to your Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the alchemist's mutagen ability (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 28). When the effect of the cognatogen ends, you take 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. If you have both alchemist and psychic levels, these levels stack to determine the duration of your cognatogen and the DC of the save a non-alchemist must attempt if he drinks your cognatogen. If you gain discoveries, you can take the grand cognatogen and greater cognatogen discoveries to improve your cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens. However, even if you have alchemist levels, the duration of your cognatogen remains 1 minute per level (instead of 10 minutes per level) and you can still create only one per day (instead of an unlimited number) unless you also possess the cognatogen discovery.

Warped Brain (Su): At 5th level, your mind becomes difficult to comprehend. When another creature uses a mind-affecting spell or ability against you, that creature must attempt a Will save. If it fails, it becomes nauseated for 1 round. This ability triggers even if you succeed at your save (or are otherwise unaffected by the spell or ability), but doesn't apply if you're a willing subject of the spell. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Hallucinogenic Aura (Su): At 13th level, a mental field emanates from you, touching the minds of those nearby. Any creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your hallucinogenic aura for 24 hours. A creature that fails its save doesn't need to continue making saves while it's confused by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends. This is a mind-affecting effect. You're immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from your aura. Brewing 1 dose requires 1 hour and a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. One dose's effects last for 1 month.
