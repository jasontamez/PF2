You take a holistic view of psychic power, believing that you must hone both your mental and physical attributes to remain in balance. The focus you find while exercising, fasting, and otherwise tending to your body broadens your psychic powers.

Discipline Powers: Your powers alter your body through your force of will.

AC Bonus (Ex): When unarmored and unencumbered, you add your Wisdom bonus (if any) to your AC and CMD. The bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you're flat-footed. You lose these bonuses when you're immobilized or helpless, when you wear any armor, when you carry a shield, or when you carry a medium or heavy load.

Physical Push (Su): By channeling your psychic energy, you can make your body capable of greater physical feats. When you attempt a Strength-, Dexterity-, or Constitutionbased ability check or skill check, you can gain a bonus on the check equal to your Wisdom bonus. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. Using this ability is part of the action used to attempt the skill check (if any). If you succeed at the check, you regain 1 point in your phrenic pool.

Bodily Purge (Su): You can heal your own wounds and maladies with the power of thought alone. At 5th level, you gain access to a daily pool of healing energy. This pool starts with 3 d8 dice per day, and gains 1 additional d8 for every 2 psychic levels you possess beyond 5th. As a standard action, you can use up any number of these dice to regain a number of hit points equal to the result of rolling that many d8s. For example, at 5th level you could regain 3d8 hit points all at once, 1d8 hit points three separate times, or 1d8 hit points once and 2d8 hit points at a different time. In addition, you can expend 2 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of lesser restoration (affecting yourself only). At 7th level, you can expend 3 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of neutralize poison, remove disease, or restoration (affecting yourself only). To use restoration to dispel a permanent negative level, you must expend 4 dice from this pool instead of 3. Use your psychic level as your caster level for these effects.

Pure Body (Ex): At 13th level, you gain immunity to diseases and poisons.
