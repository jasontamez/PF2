Deflection Field - Phrenic Amplifications - Psychic







<a href="phrenicamplificationsdisplaya8b3.html?ItemName=Deflection%20Field">Deflection Field</a> (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 16</a>): Whenever the psychic casts a linked spell that grants her a deflection bonus to AC, she can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to automatically reflect the first ranged attack that misses her (as long as the linked spell remains active) back at the attacker. This reflected attack uses the original attack roll plus a circumstance bonus equal to the psychic's caster level.

This is a major amplification.
