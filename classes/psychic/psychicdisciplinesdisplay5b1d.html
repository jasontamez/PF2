You draw power from a void in your emotions, a yawning and empty chasm where your hopes and dreams and fears should be. It is very rare for any creature besides a gnome to have this psychic discipline-usually a bleachling or a gnome with a particularly strong fear of the Bleaching-but in occasional cases members of other races have been known to develop such a strong nihilistic ennui or depression that they can tap into the vitality-draining effects of this discipline as well.

Discipline Powers: Your emotional malaise combines with your psychic ability to allow you to drain the vibrancy from the world around you.

Draining Touch: As a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to drain vitality from a creature. If the attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier) or take 1d2 points of Charisma damage. If a creature is affected, the colors of its skin, hair, and eyes dull and become less vibrant. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this power again for 24 hours. You regain 1 point in your phrenic pool each time you successfully drain a creature this way. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier.

Emotionally Distant: At 5th level, your emotions have atrophied such that you rarely have any genuine feelings at all. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws to resist charm, emotion, and fear effects.

Drain Vibrancy: At 13th level, you can drain the color and vitality from the world around you. Three times per day, as a standard action you can drain vibrancy within a 30-foot radius, causing the area and all creatures within it to become pale and sallow. Each living creature in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your psychic level + your Wisdom modifier) or take 1 temporary negative level as their life force drains away. If you're at least 17th level, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 2 temporary negative levels instead.
