You have embraced those aspects of your body that cause you agony, respecting the perspective they grant you if not necessarily the roles they've condemned you to in life.

Discipline Powers: Your powers relate to your discipline and mastery of mind over matter.

Agitating Cognizance (Su): Whenever you are not maintaining an altered form via metamorphosis (including the 24 hours normally required to assume a new form), your maximum number of points in your phrenic pool increases by 1.

Metamorphosis (Su): By meditating for 1 hour, you can trigger a slow, physical metamorphosis that takes 24 hours to complete (during which you do not gain the benefits of this new form). This ability cannot change your type or subtype, grant new abilities or natural weapons, or change your size category, but otherwise allows you to transform your appearance into anything possible for creatures of your type and subtype. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to one physical ability score of your choice (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) while in this altered form. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 psychic levels you have. Your shape and ability score bonus persist until you assume a new form or your current altered form ends. When meditating to begin your metamorphosis, you can spend 1 point from your phrenic pool either to change your size category to Small or Medium, or to gain a new ability from those provided by the alter self spell. If you do so, your altered form lasts only 1 hour per level.

Spirit Channeling (Su): As your self-awareness expands, you become increasingly attuned to the spirit world around you. At 5th level, as part of your meditation to initiate metamorphosis, you can invite a wandering spirit to share your body as if you were a shaman (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 37). You gain the associated 1st-level spirit ability as long as you maintain your altered form, but your metamorphosis form also exhibits some aspect of the spirit you host, such as vivid red hair for a flame spirit or gauntness for a bone spirit.

Greater Spirit Channeling (Su): At 13th level, when you open your body to a wandering spirit, you also gain that wandering spirit's greater spirit ability as long as you are in a metamorphosed form.
