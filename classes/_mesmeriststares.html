Stares - Mesmerist



Bold Stares


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures</a>
At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist's hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The mesmerist can't choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist's bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist's hypnotic stare.

The mesmerist can also partially affect such a creature with his mind-affecting spells and abilities if it's under the effect of his hypnotic stare; it gains a +2 bonus on its saving throw (if any), and if affected, it still has a 50% chance each round of ignoring the effect. Ignoring the effect doesn't end the effect, but does allow the creature to act normally for that round.</td>

Devilbane Gazes


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins</a>
Chelish mesmerists have refined their hypnotic stares to include a suite of gaze attacks useful for negotiating with or undermining outsiders. In the decades since, these secrets have begun to slip beyond the Hell-bound nation's borders, and now can be found throughout the Inner Sea region, especially in areas that interact frequently with outsiders.

Devilbane gazes can be selected beginning at 3rd level as options for the mesmerist's bold stare improvements. They tend to be more limited in their scope than standard bold stare improvements, but cut to the core of an outsider's being. When a devilbane gaze is used against a creature with the outsider type, double the hypnotic stare penalty applied by the devilbane gaze improvement (but not the Will save penalty the original hypnotic stare imposes). Despite their moniker, devilbane gazes affect all outsiders equally well.

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeriststaresdisplay1edf.html?ItemName=Devilbane%20Dampening">Devilbane Dampening</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 13</a>): The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the target's resistance to a single form of energy, chosen by the mesmerist when he initiates the stare. If the mesmerist targets a form of energy to which his target has no resistance, this improvement has no effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeriststaresdisplay5ede.html?ItemName=Devilbane%20Dismissal">Devilbane Dismissal</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 13</a>): The hypnotic stare reduces the duration of any conjuration (summoning) spells the target casts, or that are currently affecting the target, by half.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeriststaresdisplaye4f3.html?ItemName=Devilbane%20Impediment">Devilbane Impediment</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 13</a>): The target of your hypnotic stare must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + the level of the spell) to activate any of its spell-like abilities (but not standard spellcasting). If the target fails the check, the spelllike ability doesn't function but is still expended.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeriststaresdisplay7685.html?ItemName=Devilbane%20Mundanity">Devilbane Mundanity</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 13</a>): The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to the target's spell resistance. This ability doesn't stack with the sapped magic bold stare improvement.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeriststaresdisplay3280.html?ItemName=Devilbane%20Withering">Devilbane Withering</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 13</a>): The hypnotic stare penalty also applies to attack rolls and damage rolls, but only if the target is an outsider. Unlike most devilbane gazes, this gaze has no effect on creatures not of the outsider type, and effect's penalty isn't doubled when it targets outsiders.</td>
