With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount of damage equal to your kinetic blast's damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself, you can cause the recipient to take 1 point of burn. If you do so, the recipient takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per Hit Die he possesses, as usual for burn; this damage can't be healed by any means until the recipient takes a full night's rest.
