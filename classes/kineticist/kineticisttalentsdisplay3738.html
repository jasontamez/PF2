Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 7; Burn 0
You weave strands of aether around yourself in order to deflect targeted magic back at the caster. Until the beginning of your next turn, every time you are targeted by a spell that could be affected by spell turning, roll 1d10-1 and determine the effects of the spell as if you had spell turning with that many spell levels remaining. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 10 minutes per kineticist level you possess, but in that case, it deflects only 10 spell levels in total (still rolled 1d10-1 at a time) before ending early.
