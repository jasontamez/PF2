Saving Throw Reflex half
You unleash a bolt of lightning above an enemy within 30 feet and send it spiraling down with tremendous force. Each bolt is a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt, dealing your full blast damage to creatures within the line. If all squares in the bolt's area are outdoors and in a storm, the blast deals an additional 1 point of damage per die. The saving throw is Dexterity-based.
