Element air, fire, water; Type substance infusion; Level 2; Burn 2
Associated Blasts blue flame, cold, electric, fire
Saving Throw none
The intensity of your blasts allows you to break through your foes' resistances. Treat your foe's cold, electricity, or fire resistance as if it were 5 lower for the purpose of determining the infused blast's damage; this doesn't stack with the reduction from searing flame. You can increase the burn cost of this infusion to further reduce the foe's resistance against the infused blast by 5 per additional point of burn accepted. This has no effect on creatures with immunity.
