Element universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 8; Burn 0
You reverse the flow of your connection to the planes, sending your body into the Ethereal Plane as ethereal jaunt. As long as you concentrate on reverse shift, you remain on the Ethereal Plane; after a number of consecutive rounds spent on the Ethereal Plane equal to your kineticist level (and every such interval thereafter), you must accept 1 point of burn. Once you return to the Material Plane, you cannot use reverse shift again for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds you spent on the Ethereal Plane.
