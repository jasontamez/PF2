Your blast damages living creatures with light. This deals normal
damage to undead creatures but also deals minimum damage
(1 point of damage per d6, can't be increased by the 9th-level
improvement to metakinesis) to living creatures. Undead creatures
that are particularly vulnerable to sunlight, such as vampires, take
1 extra point of damage per die from the infused blast.
