Element water; Type utility (Sp); Level 1; Burn 0
You can turn fresh water into seawater, and vice versa. This can affect a volume of water equal to 2 gallons per kineticist level, allowing sea creatures to survive in water that was fresh and freshwater creatures to survive in water that was briny. Additionally, when you alter water's salinity with this talent, you can adjust the water's temperature so that a creature can survive in it more easily (or simply be more comfortable). Water altered in this way must be confined within an appropriately sized container; attempts to alter a larger quantity of water fail.

Attunement

See the book Occult Realms for more information on elemental saturation and attunements.

A hydrokineticist must demonstrate (or fake) the favor of Danglosa, the town's mysterious anglerfish god-ruler. She must then follow the swirling currents of Outsea, succeeding at four consecutive DC 20 Swim checks without taking 10. If she succeeds, she can learn the water alteration wild talent. If she fails, she takes 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage.
