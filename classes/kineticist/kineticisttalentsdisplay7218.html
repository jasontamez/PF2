You infuse your elemental energy with kundalini serpent fire. Choose a chakra you can currently open; you must accept an amount of burn equal to the chakra's number (1 for root, 2 for sacral, and so on). Your unarmed strikes with the infused blast cause the target to suffer the effects of blocking the chosen chakra as per the <a href="featdisplay3ad0.html?ItemName=Block%20Chakras">Block Chakras</a> or <a href="featdisplayc248.html?ItemName=Block%20Upper%20Chakras">Block Upper Chakras</a> feat. You can use this infusion only while also using the kinetic fist form infusion.
