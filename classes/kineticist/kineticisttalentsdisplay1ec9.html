Element fire; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 1
Prerequisite heat adaptation, searing flesh
You create an aura of shimmering heat that distorts the area around you. Until the next time your burn is removed, you can begin or end the heat aura as a swift action. The temperature in the area 30 feet around you rises by 5?? F per kineticist level you possess, to a maximum modified temperature of 120?? F. If this brings the temperature to at least 90?? F, all attacks made by creatures within 5 feet of you suffer a 20% miss chance due to concealment. You are immune to these effects, as are those immune to fire or benefiting from endure elements.
