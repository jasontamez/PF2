You can repel or attract metal objects in a vast line with a magnetism so strong that there is no hope of escaping. This functions as repel metal or stone, except only for metal objects, and you can also pull the objects toward you instead of pushing them away. The effect lasts for 1 round, and the pulling version of the effect can't pull objects into the air unless they are already airborne. You can accept 1 point of burn to increase the duration to 1 round per kineticist level you have.
