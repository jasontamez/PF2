Saving Throw Fortitude negates; see text; SR no
You transform a source of open flame within 120 feet into a cloud of choking smoke, filling a 20-foot-radius spread and affecting vision like a smokestick. All creatures that begin their turns inside the area become sickened as long as they remain in the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter (Fortitude negates).
