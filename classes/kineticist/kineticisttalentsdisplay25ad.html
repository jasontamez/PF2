You send a tremor through the ground or other solid surface with which you are in contact, allowing you to affect a burrowing or incorporeal creature within that same surface with a normal kinetic blast. This infusion doesn't allow you to attack creatures above the ground if you are burrowing or to ignore total cover provided by factors other than burrowing.
