You create a growing singularity. Choose a grid intersection within 30 feet. All creatures and objects in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on the intersection take 1/4 your blast's normal amount of damage (or half damage for a negative blast). On your next turn, the singularity deals damage in a 10-foot-radius burst, and on your turn after that, it deals damage in a 15-foot-radius burst. The DC is Dexterity-based.
