When you learn this infusion, select an <a href="monkucstylestrikes.html">unchained monk style strike</a>. You can use that style strike during a flurry of blows with your infused blast, though you must still follow the limitation of one style strike per flurry of blows (or two if you are a 15th-level <a href="classdisplay32f8.html?ItemName=Monk%20(Unchained)">unchained monk</a>). If you select flying kick, the distance is equal to your elemental overflow bonus on attack rolls ?? 10 feet. You can use this infusion only while also using the kinetic fist form infusion.

Special: You can select this infusion multiple times. Each time, you must select a different style strike.
