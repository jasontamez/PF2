You transport a single creature you touch to the plane associated with your element. Precise accuracy regarding a particular arrival location on the intended plane is almost impossible. The creature appears 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. Elemental exile transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creature must find other means to travel back (such as casting <a href="spelldisplaydf57.html?ItemName=plane%20shift">plane shift</a> or using elemental exile again).
