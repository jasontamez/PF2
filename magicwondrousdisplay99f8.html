Description

Crafted from cattail wicker, rendered magically immune to fire, and blackened by years of use, blackwick cauldrons are but one variety of a number of similar items. Designed to aid in the crafting of potions and admixtures, a blackwick cauldron grants a +5 competence bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks and a +5 bonus on Spellcraft checks to create magic potions with the Brew Potion feat. Additionally, a cauldron allows a user to craft multiple potions at a faster rate than normal. The user can craft a single potion with a value of 300 gp or less in 2 hours and can make any combination of potions totaling 1,200 gp or less in value in a single day.

In addition to its crafting uses, a blackwick cauldron can cast identify once per day on an item placed inside of it.

A blackwick cauldron can also be used as a focus or inexpensive material component for spells of the divination school, such as clairaudience/clairvoyance or prying eyes, as long as such focus or material component has a cost of 5 gp or less.
