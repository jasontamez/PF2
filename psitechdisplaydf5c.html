As a standard action, you can sacrifice an unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a ray of laser energy, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This attack deals 2d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every level of the spell slot you sacrificed. You can't sacrifice 0-level spells in this manner. You must be at least 11th level to select this discovery.
