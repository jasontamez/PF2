Description

This +2 injecting wounding rapier is prized among the cults of Ydersius. This sword increases the save DC of any poison applied to its blade by 1. If the wielder worships Ydersius, she can utter a silent prayer to the god as a swift action up to three times per day. Each prayer creates 1 dose of purple worm poison (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560) in the sword's pommel reservoir.
