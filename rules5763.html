Class grafts are more detailed than creature type grafts, ensuring that they more closely represent a PC class of the appropriate level. Each class graft is divided into the following sections.

Special Rules: This section appears in only some entries, and describes the class's significant requirements or features.

Required Array: You should use a specific array when you create a monster of this class. This is one instance in which a graft has a prerequisite, meant to match the feel of the class.

If you want to replicate a class without using the indicated array, do so without using the class graft. For example, if you wanted to create a cleric monster with the combatant array, you could still achieve a cleric's flavor by choosing the secondary magic option in Step 7. This essentially replicates a cleric built under the standard creation system that took combat feats and pre-casts many of its spells to give itself combat bonuses.

Statistics Adjustments: These change or replace some of the baseline numbers, skills, and options given by the monster's array. Apply the adjustments as written. Any skill listed replaces one of the choices of skills the monster gets from its array (with either a master or good bonus, as specified). If a monster gains additional skills above the normal allotment, this entry lists "one additional master skill" or "one additional good skill." The adjustments might also specify options, which replace the allotted options the monster gets from its array.

CR Entries: These adjustments replicate advancement by level. Apply only the highest entry to your monster: a CR 3 rogue would get the CR 3 line, but not the CR 1 line. Options gained from these entries replace options granted by the monster's array. It's possible the class graft will add more options than the monster's array allows; that's fine, and as usual you can selectively add or remove bonus options if you need to do so to make the monster function in a thematically appropriate way. See Step 7 for descriptions of these options.

Suggested Ability Modifiers: This section lists the recommended assignments for the monster's ability score bonuses, in order from highest to lowest. For instance, the barbarian lists "Strength, Constitution, Dexterity," meaning that when making a CR 1/2 barbarian, you would give it a +3 Strength modifier, a +2 Constitution modifier, and a +1 Dexterity modifier.

Suggested Options: These entries offer suggestions for cases in which the monster's array grants additional monster options beyond those determined by the class graft. They typically mimic flexible character class options, such as barbarian rage powers or rogue talents (see <a href="rules09c3.html?Name=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 7</a>).

Suggested Spell Lists: Found only in class grafts for spellcaster monsters, these entries point you toward the spell lists that best replicate that class's typical spells.

Arcane School Options

Specialist wizards in particular are defined by the schools in which they focus. Consider the following monster options if an arcane school is particularly important to the wizard. Any creature that predominantly uses spells from a single school might also draw from the school's list of options. See <a href="rules09c3.html?Name=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 7</a> for descriptions of monster options.
Abjuration: Energy resistance (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), protective ward.
Conjuration: Dimensional steps, magic attack (acid), powerful summons.
Divination: Bolstering touch, improved initiative.
Enchantment: Bestow major condition (dazed, 1 round), persuasive.
Evocation: Magic attack (force), potent magic damage.
Illusion: Bestow moderate condition (blinded, ranged touch attack, 1 round).
Necromancy: Bestow minor condition (shaken), turn undead.

Advanced Class Guide Classes

To create a monster that mimics a class from Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide, use one of the class grafts, but replace some of the options with those from a secondary class graft. In some cases, it's easiest to just use an existing class graft whole cloth and make it feel more like the Advanced Class Guide class by choosing appropriate monster options. Use the table below to determine which to use for each.

Animal Companions and Mounts

If you decide a monster should have an animal companion or mount, choose an animal from the list of a <a href="spelldisplay0208.html?ItemName=summon%20nature%e2%80%99s%20ally%201">summon nature's ally</a> spell. The spell must have a level no higher than 1/2 the monster's CR. Treat the companion as an additional creature in the encounter, awarding XP for defeating it as if it were an independent creature rather than an animal companion.

Alternatively, you can create an animal from scratch using simple monster creation. This monster should have a CR no higher than 1 + 1/2 the primary monster's CR. Award XP for defeating it as if it were not an animal companion.
