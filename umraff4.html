The creature is able to cast spells like a member of a spellcasting class. The creature counts as a member of that class for the purpose of any effect or ability relating to casting spells as that class. For example, it can use spell completion and spell trigger items usable by that class or use magic items that affect that class's spellcasting (such as <a href="magicwondrousdisplayfb9a.html?FinalName=Incense%20of%20Meditation">incense of meditation</a> or a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay91ca.html?FinalName=Pearl%20of%20Power1st">pearl of power</a>). If the creature has any other abilities relating to that class (such as <a href="clericdomains.html">cleric domains</a> or a <a href="sorcererbloodlines.html">sorcerer bloodline</a>), this is explained in its entry. If the creature gains levels in that spellcasting class, these abilities stack (for example, a <a href="monsterdisplay5f7c-2.html?ItemName=Spirit%20Naga">spirit naga</a> who gains 3 sorcerer levels casts spells as a 10thlevel sorcerer). Some creatures may have unusual abilities unavailable to spellcasters of that class (such as a spirit naga's ability to learn cleric spells with her sorcerer spells known).
