Description

This is a hand-sized replica of a wasp's nest, crafted out
of paper. It is extremely fragile and comes in a snug rigid
case. If the nest is placed on the floor or ground, each
time a creature passes through that square there is a 50%
chance that it kicks or steps on the nest, triggering it. The nest may instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet),
triggering when it strikes a hard surface or a creature. When
triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks the
nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is
killed, or the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which
point the swarm attacks the next nearest creature. If the
swarm can't find any targets, it waits in place until another
creature appears. The swarm dissipates 9 minutes after
being released.
