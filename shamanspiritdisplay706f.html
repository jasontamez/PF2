A shaman who selects the bones spirit is cadaverously thin, with sunken eye sockets and dead eyes that stare off into the distance. Her body has a faint smell of the grave. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, a ghostly wind whips her hair and clothes about, and the unpleasant stench becomes more prominent.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Bones spirit can select from the following hexes.

Bone Lock (Su): With a quick incantation, the shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to suffer stiffness in the joints and bones, causing the target to be staggered 1 round. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect. At 8th level, the duration is increased to a number of rounds equal to her shaman level, though the target can attempt a save each round to end the effect if its initial saving throw fails. At 16th level, the target can no longer attempt a saving throw each round to end the effect, although it still attempts the initial Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect entirely.

Bone Ward (Su): A shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a bone ward. The warded creature becomes encircled by a group of flying bones that grant it a +2 deflection bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. At 8th level, the ward increases to +3 and lasts for 1 minute. At 16th level, the bonus increases to +4 and lasts for 1 hour. Once the bone ward ends, the creature cannot be the target of the hex again for 24 hours.

Deathly Being (Su): If the shaman is a living creature, she reacts to positive and negative energy as if she were undead-positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her. If she's an undead creature or a creature with the negative energy affinity ability, she gains a +1 bonus to her channel resistance. At 8th level, if she's a living creature she gains a +4 bonus on saves against death effects and effects that drain energy, or if she's an undead creature her bonus to channel resistance increases to +2.

At 16th level, if the shaman a living creature, she takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though she can still be killed if she accrues more negative levels than she has Hit Dice. Furthermore, after 24 hours any negative levels the shaman has are removed without requiring her to succeed at an additional saving throw. If the shaman is an undead creature, her bonus to channel resistance increases to +4.

Fearful Gaze (Su): With a single shout, the shaman causes one target creature within 30 feet to become shaken for 1 round. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. At 8th level, she makes the target frightened instead. At 16th level, she makes it panicked instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Grave Sight (Su): The shaman sees the states of life, death, undeath, and general health of those around her. When using this ability, she can tell whether or not creatures within 30 feet that she can see are living, wounded, dying, or dead, as well as determine if any are undead. Lastly, she can tell if those creatures are poisoned or diseased. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal gives off a ghostly glow and seems nearly transparent. The animal is under the constant effects of blur, with a caster level equal to the shaman's level.

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Bones spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Touch of the Grave (Su): As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack infused with negative energy that deals 1d4 points of damage + 1 point of damage for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. She can instead touch an undead creature to heal it of the same amount of damage. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modif ier. At 11th level, any weapon that the shaman wields is treated as an unholy weapon.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Bones spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Shard Soul (Su): The shaman gains DR 3/magic. This DR increases by 1 for every 4 shaman levels she possesses beyond 8th. In addition, as a standard action she can cause jagged pieces of bone to explode from her body in a 10-footradius burst. This deals 1d6 points of piercing damage for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between each use.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Bones spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Shedding Form (Su): As a standard action, the shaman sheds her body and becomes incorporeal. While in this form, all of her weapon attacks are considered to have the ghost touch weapon special ability. The shaman can use this ability for a number of rounds equal to her shaman level, though those rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of death. Once per round, she can cast bleed or stabilize as a free action. If she is reduced to below 0 hit points, she automatically stabilizes. She can cast animate dead at will without paying a material component cost, although she is still subject to the usual Hit Dice control limit. Once per day, she can cast power word kill, but the spell can target a creature with 150 hit points or fewer.
