Special Abilities

Contingency Whenever Baba Yaga is attacked, she is affected
by mislead.


Exceptional Stats (Ex) Baba Yaga was born a perfect specimen
of humanity. As a result, her ability scores were generated
using 25 points, rather than using the standard 15 point buy
used to create most NPCs. Additionally, Baba Yaga has much
more gear than an NPC of her level would normally have.
These modifications increase her total CR by 2.


Forceful Presence (Ex) Baba Yaga adds her Charisma modifier
as an insight bonus to her Armor Class and on all of her saving
throws. In addition, Baba Yaga uses her Charisma score as
well as her Constitution score when calculating hit points. This
ability increases her total CR by 1.


Hut Familiar (Ex) Baba Yaga built her Dancing Hut using a
combination of the witch's hut hex and the sanctum mythic
path ability, and over time expanded the artifact's powers
to its present state. The Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga serves
as Baba Yaga's familiar, and replaces the normal witch's
familiar ability. Baba Yaga's life is forever intertwined with her
Dancing Hut and parts of her essence reside within it. As long
as the hut exists, this special connection grants her 300 bonus
hit points, DR 10/epic and good, and regeneration 20. This
ability increases her total CR by 1.


Immortal (Su) Baba Yaga has hidden her death to make
herself even more difficult to kill. This functions as the base
mythic ability (Mythic Adventures 13), but Baba Yaga always
returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of how she is killed.
In order to permanently kill Baba Yaga, her death must be
found and released back into her body, at which point she
can be killed with a coup de grace or critical hit made with
an artifact.


Long-Lived (Ex) Mystical arcane powers, mythic abilities,
and complex arcane rituals have extended Baba Yaga's
life. She gains the +3 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age,
but she doesn't gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity,
and Constitution resulting from this advanced age. Baba
Yaga's supernaturally empowered life grants her complete
immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and
compulsion effects, death effects, disease, energy drain,
petrification, poison, and all forms of madness (including
confusion effects and feeblemind). This ability increases her
total CR by 1.


Permanent Spells Through the use of permanency, Baba Yaga
is constantly under the effect of the following spells: arcane
sight, darkvision, read magic, see invisibility, and tongues.
Baba Yaga has also devised a way to inscribe symbol spells
upon her person. Baba Yaga has permanent symbols of
death (DC 36) magically inscribed on the center of her chest,
between her shoulder blades, upon the crown of her head,
and on the soles of her feet. Only a few great beings have
knowledge of the symbols' passwords (each symbol has its
own unique phrase), and even fewer significant personalities
have been attuned to the symbols.


Queen of Witches (Ex) As Queen of Witches, Baba Yaga knows
all witch spells, as well as all sorcerer/wizard spells. Baba
Yaga also has knowledge of many other spells that she has
researched. Many of these are arcane versions of divine
spells. In addition, Baba Yaga can create artifacts, and has
done so to great extent, the greatest of which is the Dancing
Hut of Baba Yaga.


Description

Around campfires and in front of hearths on
cold winter nights, wise grandmothers and
favored uncles recite countless tales of a stern
and powerful woman. Some know her as the Old Crone,
others as Old Knobby Legs. She's often called the Queen
of the Witches, but those who are wise call her Dear
Grandmother. She is Baba Yaga, and on Golarion, she has
an oppressive and violent legacy. But, on other worlds, the
foolhardy and the brave seek her for wisdom and magic.
