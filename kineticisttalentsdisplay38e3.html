Element fire; Type utility (Su); Level 2; Burn -
Prerequisite burning infusion
Over time, your burning infusion sears away your foe's fire resistance. When you roll burn damage from burning infusion against a foe, decrease the foe's fire resistance by an amount equal to the unmodified burn damage; don't apply fire resistance to this roll for the purpose of determining the reduction. This decrease lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your kineticist level. These decreases stack, to a minimum resistance of 0.
