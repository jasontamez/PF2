Transporters specialize in smuggling people as efficiently as possible through harsh and difficult environments. Individuals such as escaped political exiles, refugees fleeing danger, and various criminals all seek the transporter's services. While some transporters actively work to serve justice or a political cause, others are wily opportunists filling a need and profiting from the high price that desperate people are willing to pay for safe, discrete passage.

Trailbreaker (Ex): A transporter constantly works to obscure his trail. He increases the Survival DC to track him, or a group of which he is a part, by an amount equal to half his ranger level (minimum 1). This does not stack with similar abilities, such as a traceless operative's trackless ability.

This ability replaces wild empathy.

Plot Course (Ex): At 3rd level, a transporter can spend 1d4 hours and attempt a DC 15 Knowledge (geography) check to plot a subtle course of travel between his current location and another destination. The transporter's course of travel is almost never direct, as it is optimized for smuggling. Thereafter, the transporter gains a +2 bonus on initiative, Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks involving traveling along his plotted course.

At 8th level, if the transporter's Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 10, the bonuses increase to +4. At 13th level, if his Knowledge (geography) check exceeds the DC by 20, the bonuses increase to +6, and at 18th level, if the transporter's check exceeds the DC by 30, the bonuses increase to +8.

A transporter can gain the benefits of only a single plotted course at any given time. If the transporter ever strays from the course or attempts to plot a new course for any reason, he loses the benefits of his current course immediately. A transporter can retry his Knowledge (geography) check to plot a course as long as he spends 1d4 hours each time.

This ability replaces favored terrain.

Smuggler's Bond (Ex): At 4th level, a transporter must choose his allies as his hunter's bond, not an animal companion. Instead of granting the transporter's favored enemy bonus to his allies as a move action, he instead grants his plot course bonus to his allies constantly.

This ability alters hunter's bond.

Hideaway (Ex): A transporter can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 20 Survival check to create a hidden shelter, useful for staying unseen by patrols of enemy creatures. The transporter's shelter can hold the transporter and one additional creature for every 2 by which the transporter exceeds the DC. The created shelter incorporates scents from the local area, preventing creatures on the inside from being detected by the scent ability of creatures outside of the shelter, and vice versa. Additionally, its floor is either elevated or constructed of a different substance than the nearby ground, preventing creatures outside of the shelter from using tremorsense to detect creatures inside, and vice versa. Finally, the clever structure of the hideaway causes creatures outside of the shelter to take a -10 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures inside, as if through a 1-foot-thick wall, while only causing creatures inside to take a -2 penalty on Perception checks to notice creatures outside.

These bonuses do not apply if the enemy creatures are intimately familiar with the area in which the hideaway was built (such as an area right near their home).

This ability replaces woodland stride.
