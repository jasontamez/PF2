Description

This mithral zip-line hook is attached to a black leather strap with a bronze buckle shaped like a spider. When the hook is attached to a rope, a cable, or a similar object, the user can move along the rope at a speed of 30 feet per move action, regardless of the rope's slope or inclination; a hook of ascension can even carry its user straight up vertical ropes in this manner. Furthermore, the user doesn't need to attempt Climb checks while using a hook of ascension to climb a rope, and this movement does not constitute vigorous motion for the purpose of casting spells. The hook can even be commanded to stop mid-travel, suspending its user in midair along the rope's path without risk of falling.
