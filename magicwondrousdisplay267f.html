Description

When played, this sturdy snare drum increases the run speed
of allied creatures within 120 feet as if they had the Run feat.
Activating the drum is a standard action that requires a DC 20
Perform (percussion) check; maintaining the playing is a free
action if the player is running. If the bearer stops playing the
drum, the enhanced running speed ends. The drum may be
used for up to 1 hour per day. This duration does not need to be
consecutive, but must be used in 10-minute increments.
