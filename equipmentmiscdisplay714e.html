Description

These chests are typically used by smugglers transporting contraband or those with treasures they would prefer to keep hidden. The secret compartment in this chest is approximately 1 inch deep. Different styles open from the inside, from the underside, or through the back. Detecting the compartment requires a DC 20 Perception check.
