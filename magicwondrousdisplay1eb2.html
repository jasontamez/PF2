Description

This thick copper bracelet bears rows of lightly engraved hearts. Once per week, when the bracelet is worn and touched to another worn lover's bangle, the two become attuned and remain attuned until one of the bangles is removed or attuned to a different lover's bangle, or until a bangle's wearer is reduced below 0 hit points, is slain, or travels to a different plane. The wearer of the attuned lover's bangle immediately knows that the attunement has ended, but doesn't receive any indication about the event that broke the attunement.
