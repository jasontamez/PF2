Your inspiration guides your strikes when you take a moment to assess your foe.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay884f.html?ItemName=Amateur%20Investigator">Amateur Investigator</a>, base attack bonus +6, 1 rank in at least one Knowledge skill, no levels in a class that has the inspiration class feature.

Benefit:  You can expend one use of inspiration as a move action to study a single enemy that you can see. When you do so, you gain a +2 insight bonus on melee attack rolls and a +2 bonus on damage rolls for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. The bonus on damage rolls is precision damage, and is not multiplied on a critical hit. Once affected by this feat, a target cannot be affect by your use of it again for 24 hours.
