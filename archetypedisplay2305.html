A number of exceptional Darklands half-orcs have developed potent psychic abilities, unlocked by generations of exposure to a specific combination of mind-altering fungi and radiation. Powerful half-orc manipulators often rule smaller Darklands tribes from the shadows, but with few orcs able to match their mental acuity, their only limit is their own ambition.

Manipulation (Sp): At 2nd level, a terror weaver can cast charm person once per day as a spell-like ability. He can also expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast charm person. If he does so, he uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the save DC. When a terror weaver gains this ability, if he already knows charm person, he can learn a different 1st-level spell in place of charm person, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.

This replaces detect thoughts.

Aura of Intimidation (Sp): Because he lacks the physical prowess of most orcs, a terror weaver seeks to end fights before they start. At 9th level, he can cast aura of doom as a spell-like ability once per day. He can also expend any unused spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast aura of doom. Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the terror weaver can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. At 11th level, a terror weaver's aura of doom causes enemies to become frightened instead of shaken. At 19th level, it causes enemies to become panicked.

This replaces telepathic bond and the phrenic amplifications gained at 11th and 19th levels.

Persistent Nightmare (Sp): Gloomkin often suffer from lifetimes of cruelty and abuse, and a terror weaver repays that suffering back onto his tormentors. At 15th level, when he successfully casts a mind-affecting spell on a target, he can spend 2 points from his phrenic pool to afflict the target with a nightmare spell the next time it goes to sleep. The day after nightmare has taken effect, regardless of the victim's saving throw, the target takes a -2 penalty on Will saves against the terror weaver's mind-affecting spells and abilities for 24 hours.

This ability replaces the phrenic amplification gained at 15th level.
