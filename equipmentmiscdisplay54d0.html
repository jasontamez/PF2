Description

These devices strap onto a character's legs in order to allow for easier movement in low- or high-gravity environments. A character wearing leg stabilizers can move and attempt Acrobatics checks in gravity between ??1 and ??3 as if in gravity ??1. A character wearing them in gravity stronger than ??1/3 but weaker than ??1 gains a foot circumstance bonus to his land speed. This device has no effect on other actions. Attaching or removing leg stabilizers is a full-round action.
