These monks deal swift and dispassionate death to those who threaten or cross their monastery.

Kel Sal Koth

Little is know about Kel Sal Koth's background or origins, even to her. Her first memories involve the monastery's early lessons about the deadly discipline she was chosen to follow. Kel's philosophy is simple, but her commitment to it is deep. She believes that only in suppressing emotion can one find true harmony with the universe-and the true test of such suppression is dispassionately taking other intelligent creatures' lives.

Combat Encounters:Kel prefers to work alone, but if a target is too strong, she handpicks other members of her monastery to cause diversions or run interference.

Roleplaying Suggestions:To call Kel unfeeling is an understatement. She only apes emotion as a ploy to get closer to her prey.
