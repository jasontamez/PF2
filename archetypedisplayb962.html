An alchemist who studies anatomy and uses this knowledge to heal is a chirurgeon. A chirurgeon has the following class features.

Infused Curative:  At 2nd level, a chirurgeon's extracts of cure spells automatically act as infusions, and can be used by non-alchemists. When a chirurgeon prepares his extracts, he may choose to render any or all of his infused curatives inert and prepare other extracts to replace them (unlike infusions, which continue to occupy the alchemist's daily extract slots until consumed or used). This ability replaces poison use.

Anaesthetic:  At 5th level, a chirurgeon learns how to supplement uses of the Heal skill with pain-killing drugs. He gains Skill Focus (Heal) as a bonus feat. Any use of the Heal skill that has a risk of harming the patient (such as extracting a barb) only deals the minimum damage when performed by a chirurgeon. This ability replaces poison resistance +4.

Power Over Death:  At 10th level, a chirurgeon adds <a href="spelldisplayc0c0.html?ItemName=breath%20of%20life">breath of life</a> to his formula book as a 4th-level extract. His infused curative ability applies to this extract. This ability replaces poison immunity.

Discoveries:  The following discoveries complement the chirurgeon archetype: elixir of life, healing touch, infusion, and spontaneous healing.
