Deities: Erastil, Gozreh.

Animal Fury (minor): At 1st level, you can touch one ally and grant it feral features. The ally gains 2 claw attacks that each deal 1d6 points of damage if the ally is Medium or 1d4 if it's Small, or 1 bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage if the ally is Medium or 1d6 if it's Small. These are primary natural attacks that replace any similar primary natural attacks the ally might have. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

Battle Companion (major): At 10th level, you can summon a battle companion. This ability functions as summon nature's ally V with a duration of 1 minute. This ability can summon only one animal, regardless of the list used. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the level of the summon nature's ally spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of summon nature's ally IX at 18th level).
