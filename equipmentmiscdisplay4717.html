Description

This sturdy ceramic jar has a heavy lid with a few tiny holes to let air in. It is normally half-filled with water and contains four adult leeches, each about 6 inches long. A leeching kit grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks to treat poison. Used for medicinal bloodletting, a leech can survive for 6 months between feedings.
