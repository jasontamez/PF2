Possess Location (Monster)

A fiend learns to disperse its essence over an area, gaining mastery over features and structures there and tainting the place with its wickedness.

Prerequisites: Cha 16, any evil outsider with 8 or more Hit Dice.

Benefit: Once per day, as a full-round action, a fiend may attempt to possess a structure or small area (like a pool, grove, or ruin) of a diameter equal to 10 feet per Hit Die. This area is spherical, so a fiend possessing a particularly large structure might only have power over a certain number of rooms. An area receives no save against fiendish possession unless creatures or magical items occupy the space, in which case the area makes a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier using the stats of the occupant with the highest Will save. An area within the effects of a <a href="spelldisplaye3ec.html?ItemName=hallow">hallow</a> spell cannot be possessed. A fiend possessing an area operates similarly to one using the <a href="featdisplayb1f8.html?ItemName=Possess%20Creature">Possess Creature</a> feat, except that locations do not receive daily saves to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's <a href="rules044d.html?Name=Possession%20Actions&amp;Category=Possession">possession points</a> can only be spent on location possession actions.

Should a possessed location be destroyed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in a space adjacent to the area it previously possessed, and is stunned for 1 round. <a href="spelldisplay136a.html?ItemName=Dispel%20evil">Dispel evil</a> (or <a href="spelldisplay4d78.html?ItemName=dispel%20chaos">dispel chaos</a> or <a href="spelldisplay977b.html?ItemName=dispel%20law">dispel law</a>, depending on the fiend) can eject a fiend, but the caster must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier. <a href="spelldisplaycdcc.html?ItemName=Banishment">Banishment</a> and <a href="spelldisplayeb0a.html?ItemName=dismissal">dismissal</a> immediately eject a fiend from an object if it fails to make its saving throw against the spell's effects.
