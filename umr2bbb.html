The creature uses webs to support themselves and up to one additional creature of the same size or smaller. Such creatures can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and it is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the web spinner. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a successful Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the creature's HD + the creature's Constitution modifier. Creatures caught in a web take a -4 penalty to burst free from the web.

Web spinners can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures, but they can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise, they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. A trapped creature gains a +5 bonus on attempts to escape or burst the webbing if it can walk on or grab something while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section of web has a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created it and DR 5/-.

A creature can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.

Format: web (+8 ranged, DC 16, 5 hp)
