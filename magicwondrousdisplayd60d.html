Description

These supple, velvet gloves are the sort that might be thrown
down in challenge for a duel or other single combat. By
removing a glove and using it to make a melee or ranged touch
attack against an opponent, the wearer of the other glove gains
a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target, and the
target gains a -1 penalty on attack rolls against the wearer. Both
of these effects last for 1 minute, but immediately end if anyone
but the glove's wearer attacks the challenged opponent. Both
gloves must be worn by the same creature.
