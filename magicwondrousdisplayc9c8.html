Description

This 6-inch-wide, perforated metallic
vessel resembles a thurible found in
a place of worship. The censer must
be filled with incense to function. On
command as a full-round action, the
bearer may summon an air elemental.
If the censer is filled with incense of meditation, it conjures a
greater air elemental as if using summon monster VII. If filled
with any other incense, it conjures a Large air elemental as if
using summon monster V. Conjuring an elemental consumes
any normal incense in the censer, or one-fourth of a block of
incense of meditation. The censer cannot summon another
elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the
duration of its summoning expires.
