Violent stories that pit relentless murderers against defenseless victims, slasher horror is the home of some of film's most brutal killers. These tales typically follow the rampage of a single weapon-wielding psychopath and his targets' desperate attempts to survive. The slasher is usually more than a normal person, possessing a drive or fortitude that makes him more akin to a deadly force of nature. Only bravery and cunning hold any hope of defeating the slasher, and even then, usually only after he has spilled seas of blood.

Storytelling: Of primary importance to a slasher story is the sense of inescapability. If the would-be victims can just leave an area and escape the slasher, his threat is undermined. Therefore, seclusion is important. Perhaps the PCs-the likely victims-are isolated by geography (on an island, in the mountains), by terrible weather, or by some other physical factor (a flood washed out the road, the PCs are in a labyrinth that's supposedly inescapable). Social factors can also create seclusion. Perhaps the PCs don't speak the language and can't effectively go for help, know the town guard wants to shield the murderer, have a responsibility to stay in a place, or are cursed and can't leave an area. In any case, the PCs are trapped with a menace they're not likely able to physically overcome.

As monsters and combat are such fundamental parts of the Pathfinder RPG, it's easy for a slasher attack to become just another fight. Elusiveness, relentlessness, and the perception of invincibility are the slasher's greatest weapons. To avoid this, the slasher can't just be an opponent the PCs outmatch, making them have to find ways other than combat to defeat their foe. A GM should make the slasher difficult to fight, but not impossible to defeat. The PCs need to be able to find tools and prepare traps that give them an edge over their foe. Objects meaningful to the slasher (and perhaps his origins) might aid them in their fight. The plot might encourage characters to split up to defeat the slasher and thus make them vulnerable to their foe'see <a href="rules97f0.html?Name=Stress%20and%20Uncertainty&amp;Category=How%20to%20Scare%20Players">Splitting the Party</a> for ways to help build tension in situations like this.

Signature weapons are powerful elements in slasher stories. A GM might give the slasher a weapon that's threatening but also metaphorical-like a headsman's axe or a scythe. Tools and unique creations that tie into the slasher's history and origins also make great murder weapons-like a harpoon, a daggerlike quilting needle, or a shark jaw fitted onto an iron mask.

Monsters and Threats: Slasher tales are monster stories. What constitutes the monster, though, is entirely up to the GM. The <a href="monsterdisplayb4c3.html?ItemName=Implacable%20Stalker">implacable stalker</a> template specifically allows for slashers to be made out of any sort of creature or character.

Often slashers are murderous humanoids who have been driven violently insane or who have become possessed by brutal objectives. These sort of slashers emphasize the monstrousness of everyday people, which might be a concept a GM wants indulge.

Actual monsters can also make fine slashers. Creatures that bear a semblance to everyday people but obviously aren't work well for this, like apes, <a href="monsterdisplayba96.html?ItemName=Bugbear">bugbears</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay7cda.html?ItemName=Goblin">goblins</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay77b1.html?ItemName=Ogrekin">ogrekin</a>, <a href="monsterdisplaydc50.html?ItemName=Redcap">redcaps</a>, and <a href="monsterdisplay358f.html?ItemName=Troll">trolls</a>. Finally, more monstrous creatures easily become slashers, even though the PCs might have a limited ability to see something of themselves in such foes. Rather than creatures with obviously monstrous forms, certain beings might pass as humanoids with the right disguises or magic, like <a href="monsterdisplayac5d.html?ItemName=Babau">babau demons</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay0d5e.html?ItemName=Bogeyman">bogeymen</a>, <a href="monsterdisplayb6b6.html?ItemName=Dark%20Stalker">dark stalkers</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay8098.html?ItemName=Denizen%20of%20Leng">denizens of Leng</a>, or <a href="monsterdisplayac05.html?ItemName=Dullahan">dullahans</a>. Or perhaps the slasher's form is inconsequential, and the true murderous entity is the sentient weapon he bears.

Basic Plots: The daughter of a villain the PCs slew years ago catches up to them at a lonely country inn and proceeds to poison everyone in the establishment, one at a time. The PCs' journey forces them to pass through the Valley of the Skulleater, home to a strangely intelligent and elusive bear that relentlessly stalks trespassers. A <a href="monsterdisplayf1e7.html?ItemName=Marsh%20Giant">marsh giant</a> shaman begins murdering everyone associated with the village that killed his son.

Advanced Plots: The PCs find a crimson garrote that belonged to a famous killer, leading to a rash of murders following in their wake. Mere months after raiding a crypt, a <a href="monsterdisplayc939.html?ItemName=Mummy%20Lord">mummy lord</a> appears and attempts to slay the PCs, reappearing yearly on the anniversary of the defiling. Because of her remarkable lineage, the notorious serial killer known only as the Queen of Razors can't be killed without infuriating the royal church, but the PCs can't allow her to kill again.
