Your boundless rage grants your blows extra strength, though at the expense of accuracy.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>; rage or raging song class feature.

Benefit:  When you use Power Attack while raging or while using raging song, you take an additional -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you gain an additional +2 bonus on melee damage rolls. Modify this damage bonus appropriately based on the type of weapon you are using, as normal for Power Attack.
