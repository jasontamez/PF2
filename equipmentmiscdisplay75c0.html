Description

This stuffed badger-a well-loved and legally protected animal in Absalom-is realistic enough to fool most other animals into thinking it is real. As a move action, a wielder can use a free hand to present the plush; any Small or smaller animal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that can see it takes a -2 penalty on initiative checks.
