Boons

(From analagous order)
1: Taken Alive (Ex) You are an expert in hunting your quarry and capturing it alive. You take no penalty on attack rolls for using a flail to deal nonlethal damage. Additionally, while performing your reckoning, you can focus on understanding one specific individual. For the next 24 hours, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks that relate to noticing, seeing through the disguises of, interrogating others about the location of, or tracking that individual, or any activity directly related to doing so.
2: Pierce Disguise (Sp) You are suspicious of everyone, and your wariness grants you senses others do not have. You can use true seeing as a spell-like ability for a number of minutes each day equal to half your character level. These minutes do not need to be used consecutively, but they must be used in 1-minute increments.
3: True Identities (Su) You are not easily fooled by those who would hide their true natures. You gain a +4 bonus on Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions. Three times per day, when you successfully disbelieve an illusion that has a duration of longer than instantaneous (normally or using true seeing), you can attempt to dispel the illusion as a free action. Treat this as a targeted dispel, as per the spell dispel magic, but targeting only illusions and with your caster level equal to your character level.Created during the Chelish civil war, the Order of the Scar was originally formed to protect King Gaspodar from assassins. After more than 40 prevented assassinations, the order nearly dissolved after a successful attempt. Resurfacing in Taldor, the order now has a reputation as mercenary assassin-hunters skilled at creating safe houses and tracking and slaying assassins, snipers, and poisoners.
