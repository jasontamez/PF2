Description

This ruffled silk cloak is incredibly durable despite its soft,
delicate construction. Anytime the wearer falls asleep
(whether the sleep is natural or brought on by a magical
effect), the cloak immediately transforms into sticky strands
that envelop the wearer's body, hardening into a solid silk
cocoon. While wrapped in the cocoon the wearer gains a
+4 enhancement bonus to natural armor and is protected
from critical hits and sneak attacks as if subject to the light
fortification armor ability (25% chance for normal damage
on a critical hit). The cocoon opens and transforms back into
a cloak once the wearer awakens.
