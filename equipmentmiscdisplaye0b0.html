Description

This metal helmet sports an open top and a tightly sealed collar that closes securely around the neck. Water is poured into the open top, filling the helmet and forcing you to hold your breath. A safety lever allows you to release the water at any time. Training with the drowner's helm requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 Constitution check. If you succeed at the check, you treat your Constitution score as 5 higher when determining how long you can hold your breath. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.
