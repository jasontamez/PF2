Your foul patron's influence hastens death's approach.

Prerequisites: Channel energy class feature, worshiper of one of the Four Horsemen.

Benefit:  As a swift action, you can expend one of your uses of channel energy to emanate a 30-foot-radius aura of succumbing for a number of rounds equal to your effective cleric level. Dying creatures in the area take 1 point of damage per die of your normal channel negative energy damage at the start of your turn each round. A successful Will save (DC equal to the DC of your channel energy ability) halves this damage. Whenever a living creature dies while within your aura of succumbing, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to that creature's Hit Dice. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
