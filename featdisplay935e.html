Whether a smuggler or spy, you've learned to use misdirection and legerdemain to conceal your own magical abilities.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc704.html?ItemName=Deceitful">Deceitful</a>, ability to cast 1st-level spells.

Benefit:  When casting a spell, you can attempt a Bluff check (opposed by observers' Perception checks) to conceal your actions from onlookers. If the spell requires material components, you take a -4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell requires somatic components, you take a -4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell requires verbal components, you take a -4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell requires a focus or divine focus, you take a -4 penalty on the Bluff check. If the spell produces an obvious effect (such as a summoned creature or visible spell effect), you take a -4 penalty on the Bluff check, and even if your check is successful, observers still see the spell effect (though they fail to notice that you are responsible for it). All Bluff check penalties are cumulative.
