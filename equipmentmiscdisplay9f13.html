Description

This long pen is made from a delicate feather and has a thin and unusually long nib. The quill is typically white in color, though variations that are crimson, onyx, or some combination of these colors also exist. A hidden compartment inside the nib allows the quill to hold a single dose of poison that is dispensable with a small squeeze. Additionally, this provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal poisons inside the quill. If this quill is used with vector ink, it increases the DC of a poison mixed with the ink by 1. This quill can be used as a small shiv to deal 1d3 points of damage and deliver its contained poison. However, because of the fragility of the nib, using the quill in this way destroys it.
