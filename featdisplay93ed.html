When a giant attempts to hit your ally, that giant unwittingly reveals an opening in her defenses.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>, base attack bonus +4, defensive training racial trait.

Benefit:  Whenever a foe with the giant subtype you threaten misses with an attack of opportunity against an ally with this feat, you can make a melee attack against that giant as an immediate action.
