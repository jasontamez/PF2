Illusion implements allow the occultist to distort the senses and cloak creatures from sight.

Implements: Crystal, hat, mask, prism, ring.

Resonant Power: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into an illusion implement, the implement grants the following resonant power. The implement's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.

Distortion (Sp): The implement allows its bearer to distort his form and location, protecting him from harm. As a standard action, the bearer can gain a concealment miss chance equal to 5% for every point of mental focus invested in the implement (to a maximum of 5% + 5% for every 2 occultist levels you possess) until the next time the bearer makes an attack. If this miss chance reaches 50%, it doesn't increase further, but the bearer gains all the benefits of invisibility. Creatures with see invisibility, true seeing, or similar abilities ignore the miss chance from this ability.

Base Focus Power: All occultists who learn to use illusion implements gain the following focus power.

Minor Figment (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a minor figment. This can function as either ghost sound or minor image. In either case, the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level. If you are 7th level or higher, the figment lasts for a number of minutes equal to your occultist level, and you can cause the figment to change once during its duration when a specified condition occurs.

Focus Powers: In addition to gaining the base focus power, occultists who learn to use illusion implements can select from the following focus powers when choosing the powers gained from their focus powers class feature.

Cloak Image (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to hide your appearance behind an illusion, as disguise self. The effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. At 5th level, you can instead expend 2 points of mental focus to appear as a creature of a different type, but you must remain the same size. At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus to target a willing creature other than yourself with this ability.

Color Beam (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unleash a beam of cascading colors at any one target within 30 feet. Doing so requires a ranged touch attack. If the beam hits, the target is blinded for 1 round if it has a number of Hit Dice equal to or lower than your occultist level. A foe with a number of Hit Dice greater than your occultist level is instead dazzled for 1 round. The foe can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. Regardless of whether it succeeds at its save, the target is then immune to this effect for 1 day. This is a mind-affecting illusion effect.

Masquerade (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to take on the appearance of another creature that you touch. If the creature is not friendly to you, this requires a melee touch attack, but the target doesn't receive a saving throw to negate the effect. You gain a circumstance bonus on Disguise checks equal to your occultist level + 10, but only to look like the creature touched. This bonus doesn't stack with the bonuses from polymorph spells or spells like disguise self. While using this ability, you can change your disguise as a standard action by touching a different creature and assuming its appearance. You can end this effect at any time. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per occultist level you possess, but you can renew the duration at any time by expending 1 additional point of mental focus. You must be at least 7th level to select this focus power.

Mirage (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to cloak an area in illusion, allowing you to change the area's appearance. You can affect up to one 5-footcube area for every occultist level you posses, changing the appearance in a way that seems natural to the surroundings, subject to GM discretion. You could, for example, hide a door or passageway, make a table appear to be covered in food, or even create the illusion of a pit. You can't make creatures or objects invisible with this power, but you can change the appearance of an object or create an illusion for creatures to hide behind. This functions as major image, and creatures that physically interact with the illusion in any way can attempt a Will save to see through the mirage. You must be at least 5th level to select this focus power.

Shadow Beast (Sp): As a standard action, you can call forth one or more beasts made of shadow by expending 1 point of mental focus. This functions as shadow conjuration, but it can be used to duplicate only the effects of summon monster spells. Creatures created with this spell deal 50% of the normal damage to those that disbelieve the illusion, and their nondamaging effects have only a 50% chance of affecting disbelieving targets. This can be used to duplicate any summon monster spell up to summon monster V. For every 2 additional levels you possess beyond 9th, the maximum spell level you can duplicate with this ability increases by 1 (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 17th level). Regardless of the spell duplicated, the creatures remain for 1 round per occultist level you possess. You must be at least 9th level to select this focus power.

Unseen (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to become invisible, as invisibility. This effect lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you possess. You can expend 2 points of mental focus instead of 1 to use this power on a willing adjacent creature instead of yourself. You can still see creatures you make invisible with this power. If the invisible creature makes an attack or otherwise takes an action that would cause the invisibility to end, you can immediately expend 1 additional point of mental focus to allow the creature to remain invisible if the creature is within 30 feet of you. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.



Sacred Implements

Outsiders and divine servants leave especially lasting impressions when they interact with the Material Plane, and many occultists seek out the resulting sacred implements to augment their existing powers. A sacred implement is always a specific kind of object, though not necessarily unique.

An occultist can adopt a sacred implement whenever he gains access to an implement school. Once chosen, the sacred implement is permanent and grants the occultist access to a bonus focus power for that implement school, but causes the occultist to take a -1 penalty to his caster level when using the spells and associated implement powers of a school of magic opposed to that deity's portfolio. An occultist can use a sacred implement even if he doesn't worship the associated god.

Psychic Mirage (Sp): You can expend 1 point of mental focus to become invisible to a single target within 30 feet, as per invisibility, and remain so for 1 minute per occultist level you have. This invisibility doesn't affect other creatures. While within 30 feet of the target, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to read the target's surface thoughts as per detect thoughts.
