Description

This portfolio contains examples of official letters along with proper forms of address, etiquette, and turns of phrase. Used by bureaucrats, diplomats, and clerks, it's also useful for counterfeiting official correspondence. It provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks when dealing with city officials and a +2 circumstance bonus on Linguistics checks when creating forgeries. A book of letters is only accurate for a particular region, such as a country or even a town, and only provides its bonus relating to that region.
