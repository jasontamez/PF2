Zahhak - Monsters







Azi, Zahhak

Like the darkness of the deepest abyss come to terrifying life, this gigantic dragon-serpent moves with deadly silence. Two rockcrushing forelimbs extend from its serpentine body and shadowy wings eclipse all in its path. A many horned visage glares down with glowing golden eyes, while two smaller snake-like heads sway upon dark, serpentine necks.

Special Abilities

Blasphemous Boon (Su) Once per day a zahhak can grant a single terrible wish. This ability is treated as a wish that a zahhak can cast for any willing nondragon. While the ability initially seems to grant the desired effect, it invariably brings hardship and sorrow to whoever made the wish. This hardship typically manifests within a month, and may take any form the GM desires. (See the Wishcraft article on page 56 for suggestions on corrupting wishes.)

Breath Weapon (Su) A zahhak can unleash a gout of noxious flame that both burns and poisons any creature it touches (60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 18d8 fire, Reflex DC 30 half). In addition, any creature damaged by the flames must make an additional DC 30 Fortitude save or be poisoned (initial and secondary damage 2d6 Dex). Creatures immune to fire or that take no damage from a zahhak's breath due to damage reduction are not affected by the fire's poison. Both save DCs are Constitution-based.

Cursed to Earth (Su) Zahhaks detest all creatures capable of flight. Once every minute, a zahhak can rasp a terrible curse that causes any single flying creature or object it can see to plummet to the ground and be unable to fly for the next 10 minutes. The target must make a DC 29 Will save or immediately fall, regardless of its method of flight (natural, magical, by magic item, or otherwise), and takes full damage from the fall. In cases where multiple creatures might be using a single object to fly, the passenger with the highest Will save modifier makes this check to avoid having the entire conveyance fall. In situations where a creature rides another flying creature, the flying creature, not the rider, makes this save. After falling, a cursed creature cannot take to the air again by any means for 10 minutes, even through the use of an additional spell, magic item, or flying conveyance'spells fail, magic refuses to work, items malfunction. A remove curse spell ends this curse's effects immediately, but cannot prevent a target from falling unless the spellcaster prepares to cast the spell as a readied action. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Frightful Presence (Su) A zahhak unsettles its foes with its mere presence. Any creatures with fewer HD than the azi that comes within 100 feet must succeed on a DC 29 Will save. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Any creature that succeeds on its save is immune to that zahhak's frightful presence for 24 hours. Zahhaks ignore the frightful presence of other dragons. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Poison (Ex) The vipers flanking a zahhak's primary head drip with a vicious poison (injury, Fortitude DC 30, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con). The save is Constitution-based.

Slain to Serve (Su) Any humanoid slain by a zahhak animates as a ghoul after 1d4 rounds. These ghouls are under the command of the zahhak that created them and remain enslaved until their destruction. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Description

Lords among the abominations of dragonkind, zahhaks rule as the most powerful race of azi dragons. First spawned by the corruptions wreaked by Ahriman, Lord of the Divs, and the foul dragon god Dahak, these bitter wyrms are named in honor of their draconic master and seek to sow fear and spread slaughter. Their very breaths are tainted with corruption, a vile double boon, half draconic flame, and half lethal poison, and from their claws seeps such depravity as to raise the dead from their graves. Enormous beasts, zahhaks resemble primeval wyrms with two black-scaled vipers lashing from each side of their necks. These smaller, serpentine heads are unthinking appendages, which lash out at any creature that comes too near. A zahhak measures upward of 35 feet from its muzzle to the base of its tail, and weighs over 18 tons.
