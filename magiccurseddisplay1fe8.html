Description

This item is indistinguishable from a normal broom. It is identical
to a broom of flying by all tests short of attempted use.

If a creature attempts to fly using the broom, the broom
does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on
his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage,
since the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks
the victim, swatting his face with the straw or twig end and
beating him with the handle end. The broom gets two attacks
per round with each end (two swats with the straw and two
with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks
with a +5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a
victim to be blinded for 1 round when it hits. The handle deals
1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom has AC 13, CMD
17, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.
