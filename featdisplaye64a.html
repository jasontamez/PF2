Your cold visage and eyes devoid of sentiment cause fear in those making contact with your gaze.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, Bluff 5 ranks.

Benefit: Your haunting gaze grants horrifying insights to the darker places of your inner psyche. You gain a +2 insight bonus on Will saving throws against emotion effects and a +2 insight bonus on Bluff  checks. Additionally, if a humanoid creature attempts to read your mind using an ability like detect thoughts, it is shaken for 2d4 rounds regardless of whether the mind-reading attempt succeeds. If a humanoid fails a Diplomacy check against you by 5 or more, it becomes shaken for 2d4 rounds by your emotionless gaze.
