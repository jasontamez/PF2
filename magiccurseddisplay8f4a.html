Description

This dark, polished stone reduces the
possessor's base land speed by half. Once
picked up, the stone cannot be disposed
of by any nonmagical means-if it is
thrown away or smashed, it reappears
somewhere on the possessor's person. If
a remove curse spell is cast upon a loadstone, the item may
be discarded normally and no longer haunts the individual.
