You ferocity is quick but shorter lived.

Prerequisites: Ferocity racial trait, orc.

Benefit:  When you fall to 0 hit points or fewer, you lose 2 hit points each round, but you are not staggered. If you are in a rage (such as that caused by the barbarian rage class feature), you instead only lose 1 hit point per round.
