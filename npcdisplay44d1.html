Tactics

During Combat The barbarian switches from a one-handed to a two-handed grip on his axe as the situation demands. He uses his shield against multiple foes but keeps his bow in hand if in melee against a lone enemy. He uses his rolling dodge before exposing himself to missiles, especially giant-hurled boulders, and assumes his guarded stance in melee. He charges with Spring Attack to get close to his enemies, following it up with full attacks.

Giant slayers seek out giants and cut them down. Raging with enmity for their prey, they allow no other creatures to get between them and their hated foes.

Jemar Crowell

Jemar Crowell is a champion of his people, a savage emissary of vengeance in the never-ending wars between the dwarfholds and giant-kin of all kinds. Often clad head to toe in stout dwarven steel armor, Jemar sometimes doffs his helmet to better taunt enemies as he brings them low. He keeps his scalp shaved save for two narrow crests of hair. His cape is woven from shaggy skeins of loosely-spun giant hair clipped from his vanquished foes, and when the weather is cold he wears scarves and mittens knit from the same material.

Combat Encounters: Jemar is a focused combatant, going after his prey and protecting his people's interests to the exclusion of all other concerns. He has no qualms about stealing kills and looting bodies.

Roleplaying Suggestions: When not slaying giants, Jemar plans raids on giant strongholds, and considers those who trade with giants as bad as giants themselves. Though he primarily works for dwarven interests, he often hires sellswords and adventurers to aid him on particularly dangerous hunts.
