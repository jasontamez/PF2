Description

These stylish black leather boots are stitched with images of
winding roads and trails through peaceful orchards. They can
be worn up to mid-thigh, or have their cuffs turned down to
make knee-high boots. Three times per day, as a move action, the wearer can move up to 15 feet (or her movement speed if it's less than 15 feet). This movement does not provoke attacks of
opportunity.
