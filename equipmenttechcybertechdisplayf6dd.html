Install DC 30; Implantation 2

Description

These cybernetic implants replace the recipient's eyes with turrets containing multiple lenses, such as one finds on an optical microscope. In addition to providing normal vision, the implants can rapidly adjust to varying light levels, making the wearer immune to both the blind and dazzled conditions.

If the wearer is willing or helpless, additional lenses can be added (or removed) from the optical turrets with 1 minute's work. Each of the three turrets can hold one eyes slot magic item. These lenses do not count against the wearer's limit of one eyes slot item, but only one function can be active at a time. The wearer can change which of the installed lenses is active (or deactivate them all) as a swift action.
