Dedicated to a single deity, the zealot hunts the enemies of his faith in secret, often because his religion is outlawed or persecuted in the region.

Class Skills: A zealot adds Knowledge (religion) and Spellcraft to his list of class skills, instead of Disable Device, Knowledge (engineering), Perform, and Sleight of Hand.

This alters the vigilante's class skills.

Skill Ranks per Level: A zealot gains a number of skill ranks equal to 4 + his Intelligence modifier at each level, instead of 6 + his Intelligence modifier skill ranks.

This alter's the vigilante's skill ranks per level.

Weapon Proficiencies: A zealot is also proficient in his deity's favored weapon, even if it is an exotic weapon, and if the deity's favored weapon is unarmed strike, he gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.

This alters the vigilante's weapon proficiencies.

Spellcasting: A zealot casts divine spells and orisons as an inquisitor and uses the inquisitor's spell list.

This replaces the 4th-, 8th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 16th-level vigilante talents.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: Zealots can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to his vigilante identity's alignment or that of his deity. Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaotic, evil, good, and lawful descriptors in their spell descriptions.

Alignment: A zealot's alignment must be within one step of his deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis, but only when in his vigilante identity. If his social identity's alignment isn't within one step of his deity's, he can't cast spells in his social identity.

Aura (Ex): A zealot of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see detect evil spell for details), but only when in his vigilante identity.

Inquisition (Ex): A zealot picks a deity and picks a single inquisition (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 41) tied to that deity. He uses his vigilante level as his inquisitor level to determine level dependent inquisition abilities.

This ability replaces vigilante specialization.

Zealot Talents: A zealot can select from any of the following vigilante talents, in addition to general vigilante talents. This alters vigilante talents.

Channel Energy (Su): A zealot who takes this talent can channel energy with an effective cleric level equal to his vigilante level - 4 (minimum 1) while in his vigilante identity. If good in his vigilante identity (or if he worships a good deity), the vigilante channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. If evil in his vigilante identity (or if he worships an evil deity), the vigilante channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. If the vigilante is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, the vigilante must choose whether he channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it can't be reversed.

Discern Lies (Sp): The zealot can use discern lies as a spell-like ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his vigilante level. The rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action. A zealot must be 6th level before taking this talent.

Empower Symbol (Su): As a standard action, the zealot can empower his holy symbol. If the zealot is of good alignment while in his vigilante identity (or worships a good deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a consecrate effect. If the zealot is of evil alignment in his vigilante identity (or worships an evil deity), this works as if the holy symbol was the center of a desecrate effect. If the zealot is neutral in his vigilante identity and worships a neutral deity, he can choose whether this ability acts as per consecrate or desecrate, but once the choice is made, it cannot be changed. At 10th level, the zealot treats his holy symbol as a permanent fixture for the purpose of determining the consecration or desecration effects. A zealot must be at least 6th level to select this talent.

Stalwart (Ex): A zealot with this talent can use mental and physical resilience to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he avoids the effect entirely. A helpless zealot doesn't gain the benefit of this ability. A zealot must be 12th level before selecting this talent.

Stern Gaze (Ex): A zealot with this talent is skilled at sensing deception and intimidating his foes. The zealot gains a morale bonus on all Intimidate and Sense Motive checks equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1).

Zealot Smite (Su): Once per day, a zealot with this talent can use this power to smite a foe. Zealots that are good in their vigilante identity (or worship a good deity) can smite evil creatures, those that are evil in their vigilante identity (or worship an evil deity) can smite good creatures, those that are chaotic in their vigilante identity (or worship a chaotic deity) can smite lawful creatures, and those that are lawful in their vigilante identity (or worship a lawful deity) can smite chaotic creatures. A zealot that is neutral when in his vigilante identity and that worships a neutral deity can pick to smite any one of the four alignments; other zealots must select from the alignments available based on their own alignment or their deity's. Once that choice is made, it can't be changed.

As a swift action, the zealot chooses one target within sight to smite. If this target is of the proper alignment, the zealot adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls (to a maximum of half his vigilante level) and his vigilante level on all damage rolls against the target of his smite. If the target of smite is an outsider with an alignment subtype of the zealot's smite, a similarly aligned dragon, or an undead creature (if the zealot's smite is against evil creatures), a good-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against good creatures), a chaotic aberration (if the zealot's smite is against chaotic creatures), or a lawful-aligned cleric or paladin (if the zealot's smite is against lawful creatures), the bonus to damage on the first successful attack increases to 2 points of damage per vigilante level. Regardless of the target, the zealot's smite attacks bypass the creature's DR as if it were a weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus.

At 5th level, and every 3 vigilante levels thereafter, a zealot can smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 20th level.
