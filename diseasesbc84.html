Even in the absence of ravening abyssal hordes, the Worldwound causes a supernatural disease called the tainted plague. Those exposed to the Worldwound or creatures native to it (including creatures already suffering ability damage from the disease) must make a DC 15 Fortitude save once per day or become infected. Those reduced to 0 Wisdom are driven mad by the mind-bending horrors they have witnessed. Those reduced to 0 Constitution perish, their bodies rotting from the inside out and dissolving within 24 hours into primordial chaos matter.

Creatures that do not need to breathe gain a +2 bonus on saves made to resist the tainted plague, but any creature eating or drinking anything from within the Worldwound must save immediately at a suffers a -5 penalty unless purify food and drink is first used.
