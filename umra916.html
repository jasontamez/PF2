An usher rules a domain in the Boneyard. Ushers are neutral outsiders with a minimum CR of 25. Ushers share the following traits and have the <a href="monstersubtypes01d9.html?ItemName=Psychopomp">psychopomp</a> subtype unless otherwise noted. <ul><li>An usher's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as epic and as though they have the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> special ability for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance and immunities. </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, charm, compulsion, death effects, energy drain, and petrification. </li><li>Frightful Presence (Su): An usher can activate its frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, special attack, spell-like ability, or by speaking aloud. </li><li>Summon Psychopomps (Su): Three times per day as a swift action, an usher can summon a psychopomp or combination of psychopomps whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise functions like the <a href="umread1.html?ItemName=Summon">summon</a> universal monster rule with 100% chance of success, and it counts as a 9th-level spell effect. </li><li>Walk with Death (Su): Ushers share an intimate bond with <a href="deitydisplaybf7b.html?ItemName=Pharasma">Pharasma</a>, goddess of death, and they cannot be reduced below 0 hit points while in the Boneyard. Any usher killed beyond the Boneyard dissolves into mist and feathers, leaving behind any gear it carried, and it is immediately restored to life (as <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a>) in a location of its choice within its domain. An usher can't use this ability again for 1 year. </li><li>Telepathy 300 feet. </li><li>An usher can grant spells as if it were a deity. Each usher has a favored weapon and grants the <a href="domaindisplay2df8.html?ItemName=Repose">Repose</a> domain, plus three other domains and four subdomains.</li></ul> In addition, a psychopomp usher gains the following powers while in its realm (their statistics do not include these abilities): <ul><li>Heightened Awareness (Ex): An usher gains a +10 insight bonus on Sense Motive checks and initiative checks. </li><li>Mythic: An usher functions as a 10th-rank mythic creature, including having the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). It can expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic versions of any spell-like ability denoted with a superscript "M," as if the ability were a mythic spell. </li><li>Spell-Like Abilities: At will-<a href="spelldisplay5dd5.html?ItemName=discern%20location">discern location</a>, <a href="spelldisplayfd7c.html?ItemName=fabricate">fabricate</a>, <a href="spelldisplayd28c.html?ItemName=polymorph%20any%20object">polymorph any object</a> (when used on objects or creatures that are native to the realm, the polymorph duration factor increases by 6), and <a href="spelldisplay5687.html?ItemName=rest%20eternal">rest eternal</a>; 1/day-<a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> (limited to physical effects that manipulate the realm or to effects that are relevant to the usher's area of concern), <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a> (the usher can use <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a> to restore slain outsiders to life).</li></ul>
