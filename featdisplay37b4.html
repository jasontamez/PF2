Your shadows dance in the darkness, carrying you with them swiftly and silently so that you're able to swap places with your kindred.

Prerequisites: Darkness racial spell-like ability.

Benefit:  Whenever you and an ally with the darkness racial spell-like ability who also has this feat are each in an area of darkness within 20 feet of an object radiating darkness from a darkness spell, you can swap places with that ally as a swift action. Your ally must be willing and must spend an immediate action to complete the swap.
