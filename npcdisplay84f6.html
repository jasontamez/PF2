Special Abilities

Colossus Hunter (Ex) The mammoth rider gains a +1 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against Large and Huge creatures, and a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against Gargantuan and Colossal creatures.

Hunter's Instinct (Ex) A mammoth rider gains the quarry class ability; this is exactly like the ranger ability of the same name. She can use this ability on any creature, not just a favored enemy.

Mistrust of Magic (Ex) As long as she doesn't possess any levels in a class that grants her the ability to cast arcane spells, the mammoth rider gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against arcane spells.

Rapid Straddle (Ex) A mammoth rider can attempt Ride checks to fast mount or fast dismount her steed even if it's more than one size category larger than her, provided she still has a move action available that round.

Steed (Ex) A mammoth lord treats levels in the mammoth lord prestige class as druid levels for the purpose of determining the advancement of her animal companion.

Undaunted (Ex) A mammoth rider adds her Strength bonus to the DC of Intimidate checks made against her. Additionally, creatures attempting to intimidate her don't gain a bonus for being larger than her.

Wild Coercion (Ex) A mammoth rider's prestige class levels stack with her druid levels for the purposes of determining the effects of her wild empathy class feature. In addition, a mammoth rider can use her wild empathy to demoralize an animal or magical beast, or force it to be friendly to her, as if using Intimidate rather than Diplomacy. She adds her Strength modifier to these checks in addition to her Charisma modifier.

In the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, strength is the key to survival, and there's no greater symbol of that strength than a powerful Kellid warrior astride one of the massive beasts that roam those untamed lands. Though these warrior's massive mounts are not always mammoths, the rest of the Inner Sea region has long been captivated by this romantic (and terrifying) image, leading to the name of the Mammoth Lords and their followers.

Mammoth riders are fierce hunters and defenders of the lands they call home. Whether part of a "following"-a loose affiliation of individual Kellid families and tribes united under a powerful leader-or loners traveling the wilds with only their gigantic steeds for company, mammoth riders are as much forces of nature as the winds that blast across the Ginji Mesa.

While it might be hard for citizens of southern nations to imagine who in their right minds would challenge a man or woman atop thousands of pounds of fur and tusk, mammoth riders do in fact face numerous foes, ranging from other dangerous megafauna to the giant tribes of the Tusk and Kodar Mountains to demonic forces from the Worldwound to the east. Orcs from Belkzen to the south are also a problem, as the warring tribes also see the value in using megafauna as terrible weapons in battle, and they frequently lead raiding parties into mammoth warrior lands in order to capture the giant creatures. Along the southern borders of their land, most mammoth warriors have a particular hatred for Belkzen invaders, as the orcs' use of mammoths and other megafauna as engines of war tends to be crude, wasteful, and unnecessarily cruel to the animals, creating a dark parody of the mammoth riders themselves.

Along these same lines, mammoths are more than just beasts of burden for their riders. The ability to acquire and train a mammoth is far from universal, and many riders come to value their mounts as friends or even totem animals. A mammoth is a symbol of its rider's strength of will and prowess in battle, and as such it's common for riders to decorate their mounts with dyes and warpaint that matches their own, or to pierce or wrap their tusks with rings of metal. Some tribes even engage in elaborate scrimshaw, carving the life stories of each creature's riders into its tusks.

Mammoth riders can be powerful allies in the rugged lands just south of the Crown of the World. Their survival skills, strength in battle, and strong connection to nature spirits allow them to protect themselves and others against the dangers of the wild. But these same abilities can make them dangerous enemies, and they grow even more dangerous if other tribes add their strength to that of a powerful and respected leader. Further, most mammoth riders are suspicious of outsiders and deeply superstitious about magic, especially when the latter comes from arcane sources. Travelers making their way through the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are wise to enlist local guides to help them placate local rulers and negotiate taboos, lest they find themselves in the path of a stampeding beast or the set spear of a charging rider.
