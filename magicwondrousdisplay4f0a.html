Description

A mask of the mantis is the traditional headgear of the Red Mantis assassin-a magical helm that evokes the eerie visage of a praying mantis. Designed both to mask the wearer's identity while on a job and to enhance the wearer's ferocious appearance, a mask of the mantis has 3 daily charges that can be used to gain additional bonuses. The wearer can spend a charge to gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the effects of see invisibility, the effects of deathwatch, or a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. Once a charge is spent, the effect granted persists for 30 minutes before fading. Multiple effects can be active simultaneously. Charges expended from the mask replenish automatically in 24 hours.
