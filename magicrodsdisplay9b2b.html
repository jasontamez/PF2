Description

This beautiful ivory rod is embedded with countless sapphires and covered with intricate designs inlaid in silver. The vision of a rod of spellsight's wielder is unaffected by any magical cloud, fog, mist, smoke, or vapor effect. This allows the wielder to see through the effects of fog cloud, obscuring mist, and even incendiary cloud. The rod does not protect the wearer against blinding effects such as blindness/deafness or the blinding effect of glitterdust.
