Description

These tiny spheres, crafted from a dull gray material and studded with tiny copper protuberances, come in sets of four. As a standard action, a user can throw four or more spheres at a single target as a ranged touch attack with a 30-foot range increment. On a hit, the spheres explode outward, forming an immobile cage of semi-solid lightning around the target. Any creature attempting to pass through the cage wall automatically takes 10d6 points of electricity damage. Four lightning trap spheres thrown simultaneously can capture a Medium target, eight spheres can capture a Large target, 12 spheres can capture a Huge target, and 16 spheres can capture a Gargantuan target. The trap persists for 1 minute for each set of spheres used, then dissipates, consuming the spheres in the process. The price above is for a set of four lightning trap spheres.
