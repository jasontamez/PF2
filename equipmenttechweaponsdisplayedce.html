Description

This slender rod has an insulated grip and a conductive tip. All bludgeoning damage dealt by an active stun baton is nonlethal, while the electrical charge can be either nonlethal or lethal. By activating a control in the handle as a swift action, the wielder can switch the attack between a nonlethal jolt and a lethal shock. On a confirmed critical hit, a target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt by the critical hit) or be staggered for 1 round. When it's not activated, a stun baton functions as a sap. A character who is proficient with saps is proficient with a stun baton.
