Description

Once per day, when this armor's wearer is subject to either a critical hit or a sneak attack made with a melee weapon, she can automatically negate that critical or sneak attack and make it a normal attack. If the attack is both a sneak attack and a critical hit, the wearer must decide which of those she wants to negate before the damage is rolled. One use of this special ability doesn't negate both. A mythic wearer can expend two uses of mythic power to use this ability an additional time per day, and can even expend two more uses of mythic power to negate both a critical hit and sneak attack from the same attack. This ability can be applied only to heavy armors.
