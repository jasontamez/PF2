Reckoning Flagellate yourself with a five-tailed lash. Whenever you are the target of a lawful divine caster's spell that heals hit point damage, you heal 1 additional point per die rolled. Additionally, if you cast divine spells, you can use the holy symbols of Abadar, Asmodeus, Iomedae, Irori, and Torag interchangeably.
Tenants <ul><li>I will eliminate chaos, whatever its form and wherever it exists, resting only when the world is right.</li> <li>I will destroy those who root lawlessness in weak hearts and minds.</li> <li>I will strive to be worthy of not one, but five. <li>I will seek the great principles behind life, the truths spoken through many voices.</li> <li>I will be a paragon of order-an unassailable example that others might follow.</li> <li>I will commit what I don't know or can't understand to the judgment of the five.</li></ul>

Boons

1: Pentamic Zeal (Sp) You can cast bane, bless, tireless pursuit, or wrath as a spell-like ability three times per day, with your effective CL equal to your character level.
2: Tireless Judgment (Su) Three times per day as a swift action, you can gain a +3 sacred bonus on attack rolls, and a +6 sacred bonus to confirm critical hits. At 20th level, you can use this ability four times per day, and the bonuses increase to +4 and +8. Otherwise, this functions as the inquisitor's justice judgment. If you already have access to judgments, you can use the justice judgment three times per day (four times at 20th level) without it counting toward your daily uses, or you can add the justice judgment's effects to another judgment without it counting as a second or third judgment.
3: Blessing of the Five (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can brandish a holy symbol to heal all living creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on you. Creatures in the area heal 10d6 points of damage. You can choose up to three creatures in the area that are not healed. Additionally, if a creature in the area has died within 1 round and this brings its hit point total to a negative amount less than its Constitution score, the creature returns to life and stabilizes. This ability can only revive one creature per use, and a revived creature gains a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day. This ability cannot be modified using any feats or other abilities that affect channeled energy.Order of the Godclaw Hellknights enforce law with a crusader's zeal, going where they're needed most in the fight against the forces of chaos. They know no bounds or borders in the quest for absolute order. To Hellknights of the Godclaw, the cause of order is a holy mandate for which they will travel far to battle chaos in lands that know little of civilization. To others, these Hellknights' faith is likely inexplicable'some believe the members of the order are experts in all five individual faiths or even that they are heretics.
