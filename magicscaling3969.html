Scaling Items - Magic Equipment









Legacy Items


Whether members of professionally acquisitive organizations such as the Pathfinder Society or simply amateur treasure hunters, adventurers dream of discovering powerful relics wielded by legendary figures from the murky past. While these might be simple artifacts or heirlooms, some rare items are infused by the mighty deeds of their former owners, and an adventurer lucky enough to recover such items could unlock their hidden potential should their own exploits prove worthy. The following items work much like the scaling items introduced in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, save that each has a unique reward ability unlocked by attaining a goal related to the item's original owner. These items represent famous possessions of specific individuals from the history of Golarion, so unlike typical magic items, they cannot be crafted, though they can still be destroyed normally.

The runic scrollwork that decorates this thick iron headband calls to mind the intricate tattoos of the Blue Warders, the dwarven caretakers of Tar- Kazmukh's arcane libraries. An heirloom of King Kazmukh of Doggadth who signed the Kerse Accords in 2332 ar, the band has long been stored in the heavily warded levels of the city's labyrinthine archives.

A wizard who wears the headband gains two extra uses per day of a 1st-level arcane school power that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the wizard's Intelligence modifier.

4th Level: The carved king's band acts as a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay7d45.html?FinalName=Headband%20of%20Vast%20Intelligence2">headband of vast intelligence +2</a> (granting skill ranks in Perception).

7th Level: Once per day when the wearer attempts a saving throw against a magical glyph, symbol, sigil, or similar written trap, as an immediate action, he can attempt a Spellcraft check against the same DC to dispel the effect.

10th Level: The carved king's band acts as a headband of vast intelligence +4 (granting skill ranks in Knowledge [history] and Spellcraft).

13th Level: The DC and caster level of all spells with the earth descriptor that the wearer casts increase by 1.

15th Level: The carved king's band acts as a headband of vast intelligence +6 (granting skill ranks in Knowledge [history], Sense Motive, and Spellcraft).

Goal: Prepare and cast 50 unique spells, at least three of which must be 8th-level or higher.

Reward: The wearer can spontaneously cast any spell with the earth descriptor from his spellbook by sacrificing a prepared spell of equal or higher level. He can apply any metamagic feats he has to this spell when he casts it. This increases the minimum level of the prepared spell sacrificed in order to cast it but does not affect the casting time.
