Description

This bottle looks like it's made of glass, but is more fragile and doesn't cause damage when it strikes a creature or object. Highly prized by theater performers, sugar glass bottles grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff and Perform checks involving the creation of seemingly realistic fights.
