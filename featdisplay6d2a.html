Your critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability afflicts the target with a major spellblight.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay4abd.html?ItemName=Blighted%20Critical">Blighted Critical</a>, caster level 12th.

Benefit:  Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a touch spell, ranged touch spell, or spell-like ability against an opponent, the victim gains a random major spellblight.

Special:  You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.
