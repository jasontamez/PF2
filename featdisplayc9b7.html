You can unleash powerful watery torrents to push back your foes underwater.

Prerequisites: Worshiper of Lysianassa or pearl seeker paladin, character level 5th.

Benefit: Once per day while underwater, you can use hydraulic torrent as a spell-like ability. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you can use this ability an additional time each day.
