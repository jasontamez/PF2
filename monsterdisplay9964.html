Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) A sirrush's breath weapon is a cone of searing sunlight that deals half fire damage and half divine damage, as per flame strike.

Luminous Scales (Su) A sirrush's touch AC is modified by its glowing scales' natural armor bonus.

Martyr's Blessing (Su) When a sirrush dies, nonevil creatures within 100 feet (other than other sirrushes) receive the benefits of a breath of life spell (caster level 20th). This can return creatures to life if they died within the last minute, rather than within the last round.

Radiance (Su) A sirrush exudes sunlight, filling a radius of 120 feet around it with bright light, though looking directly at a sirrush does not cause blindness as would looking at the sun. This sunlight affects creatures such as certain undead and fungi as if it were real sunlight. A sirrush's radiance aura is suppressed when it is below half its maximum hit point total (203 hp for the typical sirrush).

Description

Sirrushes serve Sarenrae and other celestial powers with ties to the Dawnflower. Enlightened and wise, they show mercy to all but the most irredeemable of evil beings. Unlike many creatures of the dragon type, sirrushes have little interest in treasure and feel no compulsion to hoard.
