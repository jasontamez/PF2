Whenever you deal damage to a creature with damage reduction using the selected weapons, you can spend 5 stamina points to allow all your allies (other than yourself ) within 30 feet of the creature to ignore 5 points of the creature's damage reduction for 1 round. This has no effect on creatures with damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/-). This effect does not stack with Penetrating Strike's normal effect, but it does allow you to apply the effect to all your other weapons for the duration.
