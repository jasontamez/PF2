These magic options are most useful for aggressive monsters that use their spells to deal damage.

Bestow Major Condition: As a standard action, the monster makes a melee touch attack against one creature it can reach. On a hit, the target gains the condition (dazed, paralyzed, or stunned) that was chosen when the monster gained this option. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to end the condition.

Bestow Minor Condition: As a standard action, the monster makes a melee touch attack against one creature it can reach. On a hit, the target gains the condition (dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened) that was chosen when the monster gained this option. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to end the condition.

Bestow Moderate Condition: As a standard action, the monster makes a melee touch attack against one creature it can reach. On a hit, the target gains the condition (blinded, exhausted, frightened, or nauseated) that was chosen when the monster gained this option. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to end the condition.

Bypass DR: The monster's attacks count as being magic, of a particular alignment, or of a particular material for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Each time the monster gains this option, choose two from the following: adamantine, chaotic, cold iron, evil, good, lawful, magic, or silver.

Channel Destruction: Choose one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The monster's weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of the chosen type for every 4 CR the monster has.

Energy Explosion: Choose one of the following: acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic. Once per day as a standard action, the monster can create a 20-foot-radius burst of energy within 60 feet. This deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + the monster's CR of the chosen type to all creatures in the burst. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.

Energy Infusion: Choose one of the following: acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic. Each time the monster uses a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that deals energy damage, it can choose to change the energy damage type dealt by that ability to the chosen type instead.

Evil Eye: As a standard action, the monster chooses one creature within 30 feet that it can see. The target takes a -2 penalty on either ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or to AC for 1 minute. If the target succeeds at a Will save, the effect lasts for 1 round instead.

Magic Attack: As a standard action, the monster makes a ranged touch attack against one creature within 30 feet of it. On a hit, the attack inflicts the monster's high weapon damage of one of the following types (chosen when the monster gains this option): bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, force, piercing, slashing, or sonic. For force damage, use the low damage value instead of high damage value.

Misfortune: As a standard action, the monster targets one creature within 30 feet. The next time the target attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check before the end of the monster's next turn, the target must roll twice and use the lower result.

Potent Magic Damage: Choose a spell subschool or descriptor, such as fire or phantasm. The monster's spells and spell-like abilities of the chosen type deal an additional 1 point of damage per damage die.

Sacrilegious Aura: The monster emits an aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius. The aura functions as the desecrate spell cast on an altar. In addition, any creature that attempts to use a positive energy effect in this area must succeed at a concentration check or the positive energy has no effect.

Smite: Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. With one attack per day, the monster can deal additional damage equal to its CR against a creature of the chosen type. The number of uses per day increases by one for every 3 CR the monster has.

Spell Combat: The monster's attacks use the low attack value, but when it makes a full attack the monster can also cast any spell it knows that has a casting time of 1 standard action.

Spell Penetration: The monster gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome a creature's spell resistance. At CR 11, the bonus increases to +4.

Spellstrike: Whenever the monster casts a spell with a range of touch, it can deliver the spell as part of a melee attack. The monster makes the melee attack in place of the spell's touch attack. On a hit, the attack deals normal damage and the spell takes effect.

Turn Undead: As a standard action, this monster forces each undead creature within 30 feet of it to attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5). On a failed saving throw, the target flees from the monster for 1 minute as if panicked. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to end the effect.
