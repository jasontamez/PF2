Description

Death cults such as the Whispering Way use this elixir to prevent their enemies from stealing their members' secrets, even after death. Elite cultists typically imbibe deathgag elixir as part of an elaborate initiation ritual when they are promoted to high-ranking positions in the cult. Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below -1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim's entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to speak with dead spells. Prior to the victim's death, only a limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can undo the effects of the elixir. Individuals that have imbibed deathgag elixir are noted as being "deathgagged" in the Defensive Abilities section of their stat blocks.
