Kytons are a race of lawful evil outsiders native to the Shadow Plane who feed on fear and pain. Kytons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Darkvision 60 feet. </li><li>Immunity to cold. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex) The extent of a kyton's regeneration varies according to type, and can be neutralized by good weapons, good spells, and silver weapons. </li><li>Unnerving Gaze (Su) All kytons have a gaze attack that manipulates the perceptions of those who look upon them. An unnerving gaze has a range of 30 feet, and can be negated by a Will save-the exact effects caused by a particular kyton's unnerving gaze depend on the type of kyton. All kytons are immune to the unnerving gazes of other kytons. Unnerving gaze is always a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</li></ul>
