Description

Carved from the bone of some giant beast, this large horn emits
an eerie, heart-lurching moan when sounded. A creature with
the favored enemy class feature may blow the horn as a standard
action to daze one type of favored enemy within 90 feet for 1d4
rounds (DC 13 Will save negates). Creatures suffer a penalty on
this save equal to the ranger's favored enemy bonus against that
type of creature. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect; creatures
that cannot hear the horn are immune to its magic. The horn's
magic works once per day.
