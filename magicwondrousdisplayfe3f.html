Description

These thick hide boots allow the wearer to detect unseen enemies, and they provide a final line of defense against overwhelming foes. The wearer gains tremorsense with a range of up to 60 feet as long as she is standing on solid ground. Additionally, once per day, by stomping repeatedly on an earthen or stone surface as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the wearer can cast earthquake as a spell-like ability.
