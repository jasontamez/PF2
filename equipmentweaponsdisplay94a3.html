Description

A variety of scythe-like blades extend from two sides of this wheeled machine. When it's pulled-typically by an aurochs or enslaved giants-the wheels' rotation causes the blades to slash indiscriminately. Each round the harvester moves, it makes a melee attack with a +10 modifier against any adjacent creature it passes; it deals 2d8 points of damage to those it hits. Multiple harvesters can be strung together. The crew required for a train of harvesters is equal to the total crew of the individual machines. Adjacent creatures are attacked by each individual harvester that passes them. A harvester has a hardness of 5 and 50 hit points.
