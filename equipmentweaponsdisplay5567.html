Description

This rigid, fingerless gauntlet has three blades projecting from the gauntlet's hand. The central blade is straight and double edged, while the side blades are curved like the prongs of a sai. You can't use the hand on which a manople is worn for anything else. A manople takes a full-round action to don, and gives you a +10 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts.
