You have learned to move in ways that better accommodate your armor, and can maneuver easily despite its bulk.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Dex 13, proficiency with medium armor.

Benefit: While using this style, you treat the armor check penalty of your armor as if it were 1 less, and the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC as if it were 1 higher.

Special: A character with the armor training class feature can use Swift Iron Style while wearing any type of armor with which she is proficient. These benefits stack with armor training.
