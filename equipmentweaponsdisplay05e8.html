Description

A creation of the orc smiths of Belkzen, this axe has an oversized head bristling with spikes and a long, thick haft that only barely counterbalances its weight. If your Strength is less than 19 (or 17 for a Small or smaller butchering axe), you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it, as you're unable to maneuver its daunting size and weight.
