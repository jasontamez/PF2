Description

This two-sided case contains a soft wax that readily takes and keeps an impression of an object pressed between the two halves, creating an excellent mold of the item. A skilled artisan may then make a copy of the item from the mold (destroying the mold in the process). Making an impression surreptitiously requires a DC 25 Sleight of Hand check.
