Description

Tattered and yellowed, this belt is made up of dozens of interwoven linen wraps bound together by a simple stone buckle at the front. Crafted from mummifies' wrappings, these belts are commonly used by explorers in the vast deserts of what was once Ancient Osirion. While worn, the belt grants a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease, including supernatural diseases such as mummy rot.

A canopic wrap also causes strange internal shifts in key organs, moving them randomly within the body. Because of this odd effect, the wearer gains the benefits of the light fortification armor special ability. This effect also plays havoc on trained healers, however, increasing the DC of any Heal check used on the wearer by 5.
