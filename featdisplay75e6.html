You possess secret knowledge that enhances and helps perfect your undead form.

Prerequisites: Corporeal undead, Whispering Way 15 TPA.

Benefit: Choose one of the following secrets:

Secret of Blood: After successfully dealing damage to a living creature with a melee attack, you can consume that creature's blood from your weapon as a swift action, gaining 1d8 temporary hit points, a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength, and a +1 bonus to your caster level. This lasts 10 minutes per Hit Die of your target, and otherwise acts as a death knell spell.

Secret of Bone: Your bones harden and calcify. You gain DR 5/bludgeoning.

Secret of Brains: As secret of blood, but you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Intelligence instead of Strength. This ability has no effect on mindless targets.

Secret of the Grave: You can designate an unholy container for your remains, such as a coffin, canopic jar, or burial urn. When in this container and not taking any actions, you gain fast healing 5.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, you learn a new secret.
