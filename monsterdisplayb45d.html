Darklands Sentinel - Monsters







Darklands Sentinel

A small stalactite hangs from the cavern ceiling, seemingly suffused with strange crystalline veins and nodules. Without warning, its crystalline elements begin glowing faintly and crackling with barely restrained energy.

Special Abilities

Flare (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a Darklands sentinel can release a flare of dazzling light. This burst of light illuminates a 30-foot radius area for a split second. Any creature within this area must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1d6 rounds. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by the light burst. Darklands sentinels are immune to the flares of their own kind. The save DC is Constitution-based.

No Breath (Ex) While a Darklands sentinel does actually breathe, it uses little oxygen and is capable of storing an adequate supply in its body to last it for months at a time. As a result, a Darklands sentinel is immune to the effects of harmful vapors (such as cloudkill spells) and cannot suffocate or drown.

Shocking Arc (Su) As a standard action, a Darklands sentinel can launch an arc of electricity up to 30 feet long as a ranged touch attack. Any creature struck by this attack takes 1d6 points of electricity damage. A Darklands sentinel receives a +3 circumstance bonus on attack roll against targets wearing metal armor, made out of metal, or carrying a large amount of metal.

While underwater, a Darklands sentinel's shocking arc acts instead as a burst of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet of the creature must make a DC 11 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

In the depths of the Darklands, where light is an alien intrusion if not actually inimical, exist strange creatures of the world's voidlike spaces that have adapted and thrived in such surroundings. One such creature is the Darklands sentinel, used for generations by sentient races as alarm systems and defenders, much like the more mundane and less hardy shrieker species of fungus. A Darklands sentinel resembles nothing so much as an ordinary stalactite with a strange crystalline mineral content. It has a rocky exterior that completely covers its body except at its base, which is fleshy and covered with hundreds of cilia that allow it limited locomotion and the ability to cling tenaciously to almost any surface- even while upside down. Beneath the stony exterior is a soft, flesh-colored, sluglike creature, though extracting one from its stony shell without killing it is virtually impossible.
