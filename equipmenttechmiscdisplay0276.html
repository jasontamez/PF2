Description

Aura moderate necromancy and transmutation

This black, wandlike object creates a narrow gravitational field that affects both body and soul. It duplicates the effects of telekinesis, but only to create a sustained force (maximum 250 lbs.) toward or away from the wielder, or to perform a bull rush, drag, or steal combat maneuver (CMB +15). The grip of death can perform combat maneuvers on incorporeal undead. If the user performs a successful combat maneuver against a living creature using the grip of death, the target gains 1 negative level as a portion of its soul is wrenched from its body. A living creature killed in this way becomes a spectre (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 256). Otherwise, the negative levels fade after 10 hours.
