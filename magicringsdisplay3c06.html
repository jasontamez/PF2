Description

When the wearer of this delicate platinum ring dies, his soul remains adrift in the River of Souls and does not proceed to its final judgment in the Boneyard. Until the soultether ring is removed from the corpse, the time limit for restoring the creature to life via spells such as raise dead or resurrection is suspended. This ring has no effect if it is placed upon a corpse; it must be worn at the time the creature dies to tether its soul. Psychopomps and other followers of Pharasma consider soultether rings to be sacrilegious, and the creatures destroy the rings whenever possible.
