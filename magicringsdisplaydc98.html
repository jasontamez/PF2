Description

This ornate ring has a thick iron band covered in sigils of calling, and is set with a large glowing gemstone that appears to be an elemental gem. The ring serves as a gateway for a specific elder elemental (25% chance each for air, earth, fire, or water) that performs a narrow range of services when called.

When activated with a command word, the elemental is called (as by greater planar ally) and demands to know what service it is to perform. It can only be commanded to protect a specific creature or object, attack a specific creature, damage a specific object, or answer questions about its home plane. The wearer of the ring is able to communicate with the elder elemental as if they shared a common language. The elder elemental serves for no more than 24 hours, after which it returns to its home plane and the ring become a valueless hunk of lead.
