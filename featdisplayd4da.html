You take a moment to carefully aim your shots, causing them all to strike nearly the same spot.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  When you use a full-attack action to make multiple ranged weapon attacks against the same opponent, total the damage from all hits before applying that opponent's damage reduction.

Special:  If the massive damage optional rule is being used (Core Rulebook 189), that rule applies if the total damage you deal with this feat is equal to or exceeds half the opponent's full normal hit points (minimum 50 points of damage).

When using this feat, you can spend up to 2 stamina points for each attack that hit the same target. Increase the damage pooled by this feat by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
