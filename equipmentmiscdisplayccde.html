Description

Known colloquially as "healing myrrh," gildea myrrh is the most famous invention of the scholars of Katheer's Venicaan College of Medicaments and Chirurgery.

When you burn a dose of gildea myrrh, it fills a 15-foot-radius spread with faint smoke that persists for 24 hours (or until dispersed by a moderate or stronger wind). Any creatures resting or receiving long-term care in the area while the myrrh is active regain 1 additional hit point per level. Multiple uses of gildea myrrh in a 24-hour period do not stack.
