When reloading a crossbow or firearm, you can spend 5 stamina points to reduce the reload time by one step; a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, and a swift action becomes a free action. The weapon you are reloading doesn't need to be the one you chose when you took this feat. If the weapon already has a reload time of one free action, when you make a full attack with the weapon, you can spend 2 stamina points to gain a +1 bonus on all damage rolls with the weapon during that full attack.
