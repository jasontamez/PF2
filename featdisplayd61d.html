Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7cc5.html?ItemName=Demonic%20Style">Demonic Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay34d3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +5.

Benefit: While using Demonic Style, when you successfully bull rush an opponent as part of a charge, you gain a +2 bonus on melee weapon damage rolls against that opponent for every 5 feet it was moved by your bull rush. This bonus lasts until the end of your next turn, and it stacks with the damage bonus granted by Demonic Style.
