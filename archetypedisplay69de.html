Some barbarians are truly savage, having little training in modern arms. These savage barbarians learn to avoid blows and toughen up their skin. A savage barbarian has the following class features.

Naked Courage (Ex):  At 3rd level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every six levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

Natural Toughness (Ex):  At 7th level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels beyond 7th. This ability replaces damage reduction.

Rage Powers:  The following rage powers complement the savage barbarian archetype: flesh wound, guarded stance, increased damage reduction, intimidating glare, rolling dodge, superstition, and terrifying howl.
