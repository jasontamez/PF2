You strikes land exactly where you mean them to.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +6, ki pool or <a href="classdisplaye4f2.html?ItemName=Brawler">martial flexibility class feature</a>.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you can expend 1 ki point or one daily use of martial flexibility to use a limited version of the <a href="_swashbucklerdeeds.html">targeted strike deed</a>, targeting either hands or legs with an unarmed attack. A target who succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) can negate the effect. When your base attack bonus reaches +11, you can instead target head or torso, which the target can negate with a Fortitude save. When your BAB reaches +16, you can target two locations; the target must save against each effect separately.

Special: A monk can substitute his class level for his base attack bonus for this feat's effects.
