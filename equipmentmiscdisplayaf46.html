Description

This alchemical oil takes 1 minute to apply and completely masks your odor for 6 hours. Creatures can't use the scent ability to track you, detect your presence, or pinpoint your location. A single dose of scent blocker covers a Medium or smaller creature. For each size category larger than Medium a creature is, double the number of doses (and application time) required. Crafting scent blocker requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check.
