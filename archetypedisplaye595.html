While many vanaras follow traditional monastic training and traditions, others learn to blend exotic combat and the mysterious forces of ki with the natural world, allowing them to move through trees and overgrowth to deliver devastating attacks. A treetop monk has the following class features.

Branch Runner (Ex):  At 3rd level, a treetop monk adds half the base speed bonus from his fast movement ability to his racial climb speed. This ability replaces still mind.

Wood Affinity (Su):  At 5th level, a treetop monk may expend 1 point from his ki pool as a free action to treat a wooden object as if it were not broken for 1 minute (this includes a weapon with a wooden haft such as an axe or spear). At 8th level, as a free action, a treetop monk can expend 1 point from his ki pool to use the Lunge feat with any wooden or wood-hafted melee weapon. This ability replaces purity of body.

Freedom of Movement (Su):  At 12th level, a treetop may expend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to gain the effects of freedom of movement for 1 round. This ability replaces abundant step.
