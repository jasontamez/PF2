Description

Horror dust is the compressed stuff of nightmares. It is contained in a glass vial that can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. It shatters on impact, creating a cloud of hallucinogenic magic in a 20-foot radius that causes victims to suffer terrible visions and hear phantom screams. Targets in this area must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. If a creature is directly struck with the horror dust and fails its save, it is also confused for 1 round. Goblinoids actually enjoy the visions created by horror dust, and are immune to its fear effect.
