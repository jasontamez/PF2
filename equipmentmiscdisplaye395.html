Description

Description from "Riding Animals" section of Animal Archive, page 14.
When reared from birth, the following animals can easily be ridden by Small or Medium humanoids, depending on the riding animal's size. In addition, most of these animals can be purchased already trained for combat.Poached from the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, these hairy pachyderms are used by the orcs of Belkzen as mounts and living siege engines. As if these mounts weren't intimidating enough, the orcs outfit them with spiked metal barding and tusk blades.
