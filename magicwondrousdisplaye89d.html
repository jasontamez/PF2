Description

This elaborate wooden mask is carved in the image of Pharasma. The owner of a death mask can place the mask upon a corpse to ask the corpse up to three questions as if by speak with dead, except the corpse does not get a Will saving throw if the mask's owner is of a different alignment than the corpse had in life. This effect works as long as the head of the corpse is intact enough to fit the mask onto, no matter how damaged the corpse is otherwise. A death mask functions on a given corpse only once in this way; additional attempts to ask the corpse questions fail.

If a living person dons the death mask, her appearance changes to that of the last person whose corpse was spoken with using the mask, as alter self. The wearer resembles the deceased person as she looked in life.
