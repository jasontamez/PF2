Your implanted trick hardens the body against damage.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist trick class feature.

Benefit:  When you implant a trick, you can grant the subject DR 1/- against nonlethal damage until the trick is triggered or its duration ends. This DR increases by 1 for every 5 mesmerist levels you possess.
