You can appear and disappear in the blink of an eye.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 9 ranks.

Benefit: You can use dimension door as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). You can't teleport a distance greater than twice your base speed in this way, and you must have both line of sight and line of effect to your destination.

You can use this feat's benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).

Special: A fighter with this feat treats Dimensional Agility and any feat that lists it as a prerequisite as though they were combat feats when selecting fighter bonus feats.
