Description

The scent of this light brown incense carries a distinct tang of peppermint oil. Once the incense is lit in a censer or appropriate container, its smoke permeates a 20-foot-by-20-foot area to a height of 10 feet. Living creatures within the area that breathe the incense fumes for more than 1 minute gain a +1 morale bonus on saves against pain effects, while taking a -1 penalty on saves against mind-affecting effects. This effect lasts for as long as the creature remains within the area of the incense, and for an additional minute after leaving. The incense burns for 1 hour before dissipating, unless dispersed before then by wind.
