Mellak the Raven

Mellak sees life as a dance and death as its finale. A performer at heart, he makes each death he deals an act in his play of mortality, often using a dancing flourish to make it as artistic as possible. He expounds upon his philosophy of a beautiful death to his victims, explaining that they are lucky to receive an elegant death rather than the ugly end of sickness and infirmity.
