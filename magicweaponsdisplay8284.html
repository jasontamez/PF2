Description

This khopesh has a silver blade polished to an almost blinding sheen and etched with motifs of vines and leaves. Blades of life's defense can be bought in Anuli's Sword Alley, and are becoming more popular as rumblings of an open war with Geb continue to grow ever louder. Each blade is imbued with a shimmer of nonmagical might against undead that grants the blade's bearer a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws against the abilities of undead. It is otherwise treated as a standard khopesh.
