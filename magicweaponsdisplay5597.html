Description

This +1 thundering pepperbox (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 138) bears a fire-breathing dragon motif, and its wooden grip is ornately carved. Unlike a normal pepperbox, each of the six barrels of a doubleshot pepperbox can be fired either independently in tandem, firing two barrels with the same action like a double-barreled pistol. If two barrels are shot at once, they must both be fired at the same target, and the wielder takes a -4 penalty on each shot.
