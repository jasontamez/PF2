Description

This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. Upon command, an unseen weapon can be made invisible, including any scabbard, sheath, or similar accessory used to hold the weapon. A careful search will still reveal its presence, but purely visual examination will not. While invisible, an unseen weapon causes its wielder to take a -1 penalty on attack rolls unless she has the Blind-Fight feat or is able to see invisible objects. On the first attack made with an unseen weapon during a combat, the defender is denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class unless it has the Blind-Fight feat, is able to see invisible objects, or is specifically aware that the wielder is using an unseen weapon. An unseen weapon is considered to have total concealment for attacks or effects directed at it, such as combat maneuver checks made to disarm, steal, or sunder it and disintegrate or rusting grasp.
