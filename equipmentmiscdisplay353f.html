Description

These crystalline fragments are all that remains of an orb of dragonkind that was destroyed by the great wyrm gold dragon Mengkare at the outset of his grand experiment. The owner of a shard receives a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks with citizens of Hermea. The individual shards are nonmagical, but many believe that were they to be reunited into a complete sphere, the item would regain its powers over gold dragons, including Mengkare himself.
