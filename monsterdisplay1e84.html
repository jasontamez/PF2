Special Abilities

Alert (Su) An ivory sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders. This functions as the <a href="monsterdisplay4ea6.html?ItemName=Iron%20Sentinel">iron sentinel's alert ability</a>).

Disorienting Screech (Su) Three times per day, an ivory sentinel can emit a disorienting screech as a standard action. All living creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become confused (as per the spell <a href="spelldisplayee40.html?ItemName=confusion">confusion</a>) for 1d4+1 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to further disorienting screeches from that ivory sentinel for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save is Constitution-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An ivory sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except for spells with the sonic descriptor.

Poison (Ex) Claws-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Ivory sentinels were most often employed by the upper echelons of Thassilonian aristocracy, especially across Bakrakhan and Shalast. These nobles competed with one another in decking out the approaches to their palaces with outlandish and lethal guardians, and the avian ivory sentinels served this purpose well. Often employed to terrorize peasants and foreign dignitaries, most of these constructs were destroyed during Earthfall when those extravagant palaces came tumbling down.

When an ivory sentinel takes flight, delicate wings carved to resemble those of a bird unfurl from the sides of its skull-like head.

Construction

Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same, regardless of the specific type of sentinel being created. (The statue atop which the sentinel often perches is not a part of its total cost). Each sentinel must be carved or worked in fine detail before being subjected to spells and magical unguents worth 1,000 gp.

During the height of the Thassilonian Empire, nobles and other wealthy elite favored these constructs as guardians and protectors in their homes, hidden in plain sight among the palace's normal decorations. Able to replace the heads of statues to blend in, these creatures keep alert for intruders and extract themselves from the statues with which they are docked in order to attack. The creatures don't need to remove themselves from their statues to use their special attacks, however, and only separate for added mobility or to have the chance to attack with their claws.

At least a dozen varieties of sentinel pervaded long-vanished Thassilon. All of these varieties were crafted from materials that wouldn't be out of place as a medium for sculpting or casting. Though the practice of creating these constructs largely died out along with the empire at Earthfall, explorers delving into forgotten ruins sometimes encounter sentinels that still function.
