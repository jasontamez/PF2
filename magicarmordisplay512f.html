Description

This +1 half-plate is emblazoned with holy script and religious iconography. Raiment of the shining crusade was first crafted by the holy warriors serving under General Arnisant. The wearer of raiment of the shining crusade gains a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against channeled negative energy and to resist negative levels. When worn by a character with the smite evil class feature, the armor sheds light like a torch at all times.

A wearer with the smite evil class feature can expend one use of this ability as an immediate action to create a defensive ward around an adjacent creature, granting the target a deflection bonus to AC and a resistance bonus on saves equal to the wearer's Charisma bonus against attacks and effects originating from creatures with an evil alignment. This effect lasts for 1 round.
