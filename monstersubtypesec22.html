These Colossal creatures inhabit the most desolate places of a world. They are often associated with elemental subtypes, and while they are only barely smarter than the typical beast, many feature personality traits that allow for rudimentary alliances or rivalries with other kaiju. Regardless, all kaiju have great capacity for devastation. A kaiju has the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>A kaiju's natural attacks count as epic and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Damage reduction 20/epic. </li><li>Darkvision 600 feet. </li><li>Fast healing 30. </li><li>Ferocity (Ex): Kaiju have the ferocity universal monster ability. </li><li>Hurl Foe (Ex): When a kaiju damages a Huge or smaller foe with one of its natural attacks, it can try to hurl the foe as part of that attack by attempting a combat maneuver check. On a successful check, the foe is knocked back 10 feet in a direction of the kaiju's choice and falls prone. The distance the foe is hurled increases by 10 feet for every 5 points by which the kaiju's check exceeds the foe's CMD. If an obstacle stops the hurled creature before it travels the whole distance, the hurled foe and the obstacle struck each take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of distance remaining and the foe is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, death effects, disease, energy drain, and fear. </li><li>Massive (Ex): Because kaiju are so massive, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to a kaiju's movement, though settlements or areas of forest are considered difficult terrain to a kaiju. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by a kaiju, and vice versa. A kaiju can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. A kaiju gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb a kaiju-this generally requires a successful DC 30 check, and unlike the normal rules about kaiju and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on a kaiju's body provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster. </li><li>Recovery (Ex): Whenever a kaiju fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, paralysis, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including <a href="spelldisplayf8a0.html?ItemName=binding">binding</a> and <a href="spelldisplaydf0e.html?ItemName=temporal%20stasis">temporal stasis</a>, but not including <a href="spelldisplay14fa.html?ItemName=imprisonment">imprisonment</a>), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect. Doing so does not requires an action. A kaiju can attempt a new save to end the effect as often as it wishes, but can attempt to remove only one such effect per round. Once per year, if a kaiju takes an amount of damage that would normally kill it by reducing its hit points to a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, the damage instead heals the kaiju of twice the amount of damage-but this healing leaves the kaiju disoriented and demoralized. At this point, the creature becomes nauseated and seeks only to return to its lair. Any amount of damage dealt to it by an external source before it reaches its lair, though, immediately negates the nauseated effect and allows the kaiju to end its retreat and attack. </li><li>Resistance 30 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative energy, and sonic.</li></ul>
