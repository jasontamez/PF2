Description

This vestment works just like a cold-weather outfit, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather, except it is custom made for an animal companion. The added cost represents custom tailoring to ensure that the furs used don't cause unwanted reactions from the animal wearing the outfit.
