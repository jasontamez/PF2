Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This silver locket contains two scraps of parchment with inspirational quotes from holy or philosophical texts written on them in fine lettering. Once per day, with a command word, the words transform momentarily into the names of the last creature to lie to the wearer and the last creature to perform a favor on her behalf. It can see only 1 day into the past. Each person whose name would be revealed attempts a DC 17 Will save, with success indicating that the locket skips that person and moves to the next-mostrecent creature.

If the wearer is a half-elf, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC and on saving throws and Sense Motive checks against allies, people pretending to be her allies, and former allies who changed allegiance no more than 1 week ago.
