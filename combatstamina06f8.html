When using the aid another action to help an ally who also has this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points to grant a +4 bonus instead of the normal +2. Alternatively, you can grant your ally a +2 bonus both on her next attack roll and to her AC against the next attack against her. (Melee Tactics Toolbox 10)
