Your earth magic is more defensive than offensive.

Associated Bloodline: Deep Earth.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell of the summoning subschool, the creatures summoned gain DR/adamantine equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with any DR the creature might have.

Bloodline Powers: Rock is timeless; it endures.

Iron Hide (Sp): At 9th level, as a swift action, you can grant yourself DR 10/adamantine for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. The rounds do not need to be used consecutively. This bloodline power replaces crystal shard.
