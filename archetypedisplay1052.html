Plant speakers build upon their racial <a href="racesdisplay427d.html?ItemName=Vine%20Leshy">plantspeech</a> ability and their storytelling tendencies to create an art form full of deep metaphors and allegory rather than specific details and facts.

Bardic Performance:  Plant speakers gain the following bardic performance.

Leshy Speaker (Su): At 9th level, the plant speaker can speak to its disembodied brethren, the spirits of nature that become leshys. He performs for 10 minutes and spends 7 rounds of bardic performance to gain the effects of <a href="spelldisplay4873.html?ItemName=commune%20with%20nature">commune with nature</a>.

This replaces inspire greatness.

Plant Speech:  A plant speaker's mind-affecting bard spells and class abilities also affect plants, ignoring plants' immunity to mind-affecting effects. At 2nd level, a plant speaker's racial <a href="racesdisplay427d.html?ItemName=Vine%20Leshy">plantspeech</a> allows him to communicate with all plants, not just plants that match his alternate form.

This replaces bardic knowledge and well-versed.

Mystical Allegory (Su):  At 5th level, the plant speaker can tell a story that matches some of the themes of the current situation in order to gain insight, gaining the effects of <a href="spelldisplaybb99.html?ItemName=augury">augury</a> by performing for 1 minute and spending 4 rounds of bardic performance.
