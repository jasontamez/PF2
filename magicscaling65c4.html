Scaling Items - Magic Equipment









Legacy Items


Whether members of professionally acquisitive organizations such as the Pathfinder Society or simply amateur treasure hunters, adventurers dream of discovering powerful relics wielded by legendary figures from the murky past. While these might be simple artifacts or heirlooms, some rare items are infused by the mighty deeds of their former owners, and an adventurer lucky enough to recover such items could unlock their hidden potential should their own exploits prove worthy. The following items work much like the scaling items introduced in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, save that each has a unique reward ability unlocked by attaining a goal related to the item's original owner. These items represent famous possessions of specific individuals from the history of Golarion, so unlike typical magic items, they cannot be crafted, though they can still be destroyed normally.

Worn by the Tian-Min explorer Amatatsu Aganhei on his treks across the Crown of the World, these utilitarian leather boots remain comfortable on even the longest journeys. Decorated with only a faint tracery of Minkaian designs, there is little to indicate the many leagues these boots have traveled.

The wearer of the trailblazer's boots is immune to fatigue caused by hustling or forced marches (though he still takes nonlethal damage as usual). Whenever he successfully uses the Survival skill to get along in the wild, he treats his result as 4 higher for the purpose of determining how many additional people he can provide for.

4th Level: The wearer gains a foot enhancement bonus to his base speed.

8th Level: The wearer gains <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">woodland stride</a>, as the druid class ability.

12th Level: The wearer is constantly under the effect of <a href="spelldisplay2b11.html?ItemName=endure%20elements">endure elements</a> and is automatically considered <a href="rules102a.html?Name=Mountain%20Travel&amp;Category=Mountain%20Terrain">acclimated to high altitudes</a>. Should the <a href="spelldisplay2b11.html?ItemName=endure%20elements">endure elements</a> effect be dispelled, he can resume it as a free action.

16th Level: Once per day, the wearer can use <a href="spelldisplayb825.html?ItemName=find%20the%20path">find the path</a> as a spell-like ability.

Goal: The wearer must travel 1,000 miles by foot.

Reward: Each morning the wearer can designate one type of terrain from the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger's list of favored terrain</a> as his favored terrain for the day. While in that terrain, he gains a  bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. If he already has the favored terrain class feature for the chosen type of terrain, he instead increases his favored terrain bonuses for that terrain by 2.
