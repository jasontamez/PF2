When someone grabs you, you can easily reach that opponent's vulnerable spots.

Benefit: While you are grappled (but not when you are controlling the grapple), you can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against the creature grappling you without provoking an attack of opportunity or taking a penalty on the combat maneuver check. If you have the Improved Dirty Trick feat, you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to attempt such a dirty trick, and the condition the dirty trick imposes lasts for 1 round longer than normal. This bonus stacks with the bonuses granted by Improved Dirty Trick and Greater Dirty Trick feats.
