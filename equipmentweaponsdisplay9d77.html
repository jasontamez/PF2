Description

The head of a barbed arrow resembles that of a harpoon. When a barbed arrow is attached to a length of silk rope and fired from a bow, the arrow's range increment is reduced to 30 feet, but it gains the grapple special weapon quality (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22). Barbed bolts exist for crossbows.
