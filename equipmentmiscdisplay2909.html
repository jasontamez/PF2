Description

This set of small gold-plated scales is inscribed with words from Abadar's holy text. When activated, its presence aids in negotiations, making attempts to change the attitude of another person by one step a swift action instead of requiring 1 minute. The user must touch the scales and speak to the intended target as part of the skill check. The item remains activated for 1 hour, or until it has been used to influence a number of creatures equal to 1/2 the effective cleric level of the person who activated it.
