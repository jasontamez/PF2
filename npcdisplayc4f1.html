Tactics

Before Combat The fighter applies oil of greater magic weapon to his heavy crossbow, then drinks potions of barkskin and heroism.
During Combat For as long as he can, the fighter stays mounted and takes shots from long range. He takes most shots with magical ammunition, tailoring the bolt to the foe. He uses Greater Vital Strike unless he has trouble hitting, in which case he switches to Pinpoint Targeting. He nearly always uses Deadly Aim.

Dwarven arbalesters are usually employed by slavers and warlords to either incapacitate or kill at a distance.

Stigr Harrowstare

Exiled from the stronghold of his ancestors for slave trafficking with duergar, Stigr took his slaving to human lands instead. He fancies himself the deadliest shot with a crossbow ever born, and considers a battle decided by melee a personal failure. Stigr keeps losing horses in battle, and plans to trade sacrificial victims to the church of Asmodeus in exchange for a Nessian warhound.
