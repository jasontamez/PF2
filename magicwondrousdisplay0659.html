Description

This belt allows its wearer to easily forage while in the
wilderness. As long as the wearer of this belt has at least 1
rank in Survival, she need not make a check to get along in the
wild; she always succeeds at that Survival check as long as she
moves at half her overland speed. She can still choose to make
that check to provide food and water for one other creature for
every 2 points by which her result exceeds DC 10. Furthermore,
she can instead make a DC 20 Survival check to get along in the
wild while moving at full speed instead of half speed. While
doing so, she can provide food and water for one other creature
for every 2 points by which his check result exceeds 20.
