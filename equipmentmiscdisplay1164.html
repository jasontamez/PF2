Description

These books detail common behavior patterns and special abilities of a particular creature type. When used as a reference (an action that typically requires 1d4 minutes of searching the text), a hunter's manual grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks to learn about special abilities and weaknesses of the text's associated creature type for 1 hour.

If the reader successfully makes such a Knowledge check using the book, she gains a +1 circumstance bonus on her next saving throw against any of that creature's spell-like, supernatural, or extraordinary abilities she identified.
