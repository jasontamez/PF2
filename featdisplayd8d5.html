You have trained your tail into a powerful weapon, and wield it with deadly skill.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +5, Lizardfolk.

Benefit:  You gain a tail swipe attack. If used as part of a full-attack action, the attack is made at your full base attack bonus - 5. If the tail swipe hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming you are Medium) + 1/2 your Strength modifier. If you confirm a critical hit against a target with your tail swipe, as a free action you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that target.
