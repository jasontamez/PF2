The lashunta are race of humanoids native to Castrovel that exhibit a curious sexual dimorphism. The most obvious similarity the two sexes have is a pair of thin, twitching antennae that sprout from just below their hairlines. Beyond that, male lashunta are compact, muscular, and hirsute, whereas female lashunta are tall, lithe, and majestic. Their personalities also differ somewhat; females are generally charismatic and commanding, and males are brusque and war-like. However, both sexes are equally intelligent, civilized, and competent on the battlefield. Most lashunta prize magical, mental, and psychic potential over common physical prowess.

Lashunta are the most populous intelligent creatures on Castrovel, followed by elves and the insectile formians. Most Castrovelians are well aware of the peoples of Golarion, thanks to a long history of interplanetary exchange, though most Golarians know nothing of the lashunta or formians. The existence of interplanetary portals and the elven aiudara is common knowledge in Castrovel, though access to them is strictly regulated.

Lashunta society has a long and proud matriarchal tradition-women are often expected to take up leadership roles when the need arises. While lashunta men may seem more obviously suited to (and enjoy engaging in) brawling, both sexes regularly become warriors and adventurers, in part because their telepathy makes groups of lashunta more effective combatants. Yet fighting is ultimately a secondary concern to most lashunta, who instead highly value scholarship and the thirst for knowledge, particularly lauding the arcane classes for the high degree of intellectual stamina they require.

Lashunta Racial Traits

+2 Intelligence: Lashunta are almost universally intelligent and eager to learn.
Sexual Dimorphism: Male and female lashunta have very different body and personality types, more so than most humanoid species. Male lashunta are muscular (+2 Strength) and often brash and unobservant (-2 Wisdom). Female lashunta, though beautiful and commanding (+2 Charisma), lack the males' rugged builds (-2 Constitution).
Lashunta Magic: A lashunta possessing an Intelligence score of 11 or higher gains the following spell-like abilities: at will-<a href="spelldisplayf61c.html?ItemName=Daze">daze</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7edd.html?ItemName=Mage%20Hand">mage hand</a>; 1/day-<a href="spelldisplay7ce0.html?ItemName=Detect%20Thoughts">detect thoughts</a>. The caster level for these effects is equal to the lashunta's character level.
Knowledgeable: A lashunta gains a +2 racial bonus to any one Knowledge skill.
Limited Telepathy: A lashunta is able to mentally communicate with any creature within 30 feet with whom she shares a language. Otherwise this ability is identical to the telepathy ability.
Languages: Lashunta begin play speaking Lashunta and Elven. Lashunta with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).

Some lashunta have a knack for manipulating the minds of those they communicate with telepathically. They gain a +1 racial bonus on Charisma-based skill checks to influence any creature with whom they are telepathically communicating. If a lashunta telepathically issues a command to a charmed or dominated creature, she gains a +1 racial bonus on Charisma checks to compel the creature to follow that order. This racial trait replaces lashunta magic.
