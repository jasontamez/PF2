The disease track simulates the progression of a disease, starting with incubation. Ignore any onset entry for a disease; the victim attempts saving throws at a rate based on the disease's frequency. At the GM's discretion, if the disease's Cure entry does not allow a cure, the disease's progression may be irreversible without the use of a <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> spell, and even a successful <a href="spelldisplay96a6.html?ItemName=remove%20disease">remove disease</a> only prevents further deterioration. There are two different tracks: one for diseases that affect physical ability scores (such as bubonic plague or slimy doom) and one for those that affect mental ability scores (such as cackle, fever or mindfire).

Healthy-Latent/Carrier-Weakened-Impaired-Disabled-Bedridden-Comatose-Dead



Latent/Carrier: A character in this stage has the disease, and may pass it on if contagious, but suffers no ill effects.

Weakened: A character weakened by a physical disease suffers all the effects of the sickened and fatigued conditions.

Impaired: A character impaired by a physical disease also suffers the effects of the exhausted condition. Whenever he takes a standard action, he must succeed at a Fortitude save at the same DC as the disease's DC or lose the action and gain the nauseated condition for 1 minute.

Disabled: A character disabled by a physical disease gains the disabled condition. If he takes a standard action, his hit points drop by 1 or to -1, whichever is worse.

Bedridden: A character rendered bedridden by a physical disease is awake and can converse, but he can't stand on his own or take any standard or move actions.

Comatose: A character rendered comatose by physical disease is unconscious and feverish. He can't be woken by any means as long as he remains in this state on the disease track.

Dead: The disease overcomes the body's immune system, and the character dies. The corpse may be still be contagious, and some diseases may have unusual effects after the character dies.

Healthy-Latent/Carrier-Weakened-Impaired-Befuddled-Deranged-Comatose-Dead



Latent/Carrier: A character in the latent stage has the disease, and may pass it on if contagious, but suffers no ill effects.

Weakened: A character weakened by a mental disease suffers all the effects of the shaken condition. The DCs of her spells and spell-like abilities decrease by 2. If she is a spellcaster, she can no longer cast her highest level of spells.

Impaired: A character impaired by a mental disease no longer adds her mental ability score modifiers to the number of uses per day of pools (such as an arcane pool or a ki pool), abilities (such as channel and lay on hands), and bonus spells per day. Her DCs decrease by an additional 2. If she is a spellcaster, she can no longer cast her 2 highest levels of spells.

Befuddled: A character befuddled by a mental disease is losing her grasp on thought, reality, and self. She has a 50% chance each round to take no relevant action, instead babbling randomly, wandering off, or talking to unseen things.

Deranged: A character rendered deranged by a mental disease is almost entirely disconnected from reality. Her mind filters and twists all external stimuli into strange forms.

Comatose: A character rendered comatose by a mental disease has lost all grip on reality and entered an inner world of dreams. She can't be woken by any means as long as she remains in this state on the disease track.

Dead: The disease has harmed the character's brain beyond repair, killing her. The corpse may still be contagious, and some diseases may have unusual effects after the character dies.
