Emkrah - Monsters







Emkrah

Lashing furiously, this semi-gelatinous abomination surges forward upon a wave of tentacular legs. These artery-like legs knot into a single stalk capped by a bulbous, fleshy head dominated by a huge mouth and a yawning, empty eyesocket. The thing's disgusting trunk and head float within a transparent body of vein-riddled ooze, like a gigantic jellyfish.

Special Abilities

Acid Spittle (Ex) An emkrah can spit a glob of its highly corrosive goo up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Creatures struck by this acid spittle take 1d8 points of acid damage.

Acidic (Ex) An emkrah's body is little more than a shell of gelatinous digestive acid that dissolves organic material quickly. Any fleshy, living creature that attacks an emkrah with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike, or attempts to grapple a emkrah, takes 1d8 points of acid damage.

Amorphous (Ex) An emkrah is not subject to critical hits. It cannot be flanked.

Doom Gaze (Su) Deals 1d6 points of damage, 30 feet, Will DC 20 negates. If an emkrah actively uses its gaze upon a creature, it deals 1d8 points of damage. Evil creatures gain a +2 bonus on their saves versus an emkrah's doom gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, an emkrah must hit with one of its tentacle attacks. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Swallow Whole (Ex) An emkrah can attempt to swallow a grappled opponent of Medium or smaller size by making a successful grapple check. (A emkrah doesn't actually "swallow" the opponent-it engulfs it within its gelatinous form-but the effect is essentially the same.) Once inside, the opponent takes an automatic 8 points of acid damage per round from the beast's corrosive body. An emkrah can continue to bite a creature that has been swallowed whole. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by dealing 5 points of damage to the emkrah (AC 22). An emkrah's body can hold 1 Medium, 2 Small, 8 Tiny, 32 Diminutive or smaller creatures.

Description

The misbegotten offspring of the god of destruction, emkrahs are the Spawn of Rovagug that will never be. Taking their names from the Kelish word for wrongful births, these horrendous beings hatch from the repulsive egg sacks known as Rough Seeds, grotesque expulsions of Rovagug himself. While not all seeds hatch, those that do draw upon the life force of destructive beings nearby, using such creatures' essences to fuel their grotesque metamorphoses. Once hatched, emkrahs never develop into full-fledged Spawn of Rovagug, but their smaller size and strange births do nothing to curb their destructive natures, which mark them as true scions of the god of disaster.

Emkrahs vary widely in size and form, with many having excess tentacles, strange colorations, multiple eyes, and other abnormalities. Most, however, measure 10 feet tall from their tentacles to the top of their gelatinous shells and weigh approximately 400 pounds.
