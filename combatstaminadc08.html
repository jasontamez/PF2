Choose a second 1st-level gunslinger deed. You can spend grit to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of grit. If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of grit when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the Extra Grit feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat).
