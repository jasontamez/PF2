Description

This +1 greatsword is often found among the robot-hunters of Numeria. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can envelop the blade with a razor-edged field of force for 1 minute. Thanks to this field, the sword ignores the damage reduction of creatures with DR 5 or less (other than DR/epic), and when it's used to attack an object or sunder a weapon, the sword treats the item as having a hardness of 5 less than the item's actual hardness.
