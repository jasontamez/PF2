Description

This distinctive +4 adamantine glamered o-yoroi (Ultimate Combat 128) was designed for scions of Minkai's imperial families and their highest-ranking and most loyal samurai, providing its wearer with DR 3/-. In addition, the armor stores the kinetic energy from blows made against it. Once the armor has negated 15 total points of damage, the wearer can release the stored energy as a swift action against a single creature within 10 feet. This energy takes the form of a force effect, and the wearer must make an attack roll at his base attack bonus +10. The energy deals 15 points of force damage to the target, and the target must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If the wearer chooses not to release this energy, the armor still provides damage reduction but absorbs no more energy until the stored energy is released.
