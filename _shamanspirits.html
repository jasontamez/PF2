Each shaman must select from the following spirits. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against the special abilities granted by a spirit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman's level + the shaman's Wisdom modifier.


Shaman Spirit Specializations

Spirit specializations are more specific focuses for shaman spirits that allow shamans greater flexibility in customizing their characters and building character backstories. One such specialization is presented below, but it is far from the only spirit specialization that exists.

Each spirit specialization replaces one or more hexes that the shaman can gain, as well as one or more of the spirit's abilities and a number of the spells in the spirit's spirit magic spell list. A spirit specialization never replaces all of the spirit's hexes or all of the spirit's abilities.

A spirit specialization is always treated as equivalent to its associated spirit for any effect or prerequisite that is based on spirits. A shaman cannot select a spirit specialization as a wandering spirit, nor can she form a bond with a spirit and a spirit specialization that is associated with it simultaneously-for instance, a shaman with the life spirit cannot form a temporary bond with the restoration spirit specialization.

If a spirit specialization hex or ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman's level + her Wisdom modifier.
