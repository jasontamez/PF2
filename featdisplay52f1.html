Your touch spreads fear.

Prerequisites: Despair special ability, mummy.

Benefit:  Any creature struck by your slam attack must succeed at a Will save at the same DC as your despair ability or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the creature is already shaken, frightened, or panicked, it is paralyzed for 1 round instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
