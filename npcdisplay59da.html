Stalking through boiling and sometimes acidic mud pits, these druids have caustic personalities and abilities.

Kiro

Kiro, the mud shaman of a remote tribe, sees outsiders as a threat to his culture and people. He acquired a green dragonhide breastplate years ago from a trader, but keeps it hidden under cloaks and wraps, ashamed that he had to buy it rather than earn it through combat.

Combat Encounters: Kiro uses mud pits as traps to entangle his enemies.

Roleplaying Suggestions: A stubborn xenophobe, Kiro does not like speaking with those who are not of his tribe.
