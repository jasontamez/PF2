Description

The void crystal crackled into existence through interplanetary feedback between a device on Golarion-one of two linked magical rings-and a facility on Eox. The ring that's buried deep beneath the Dim Gate sits at the center of this great crystal, which shudders and expands in the collection chamber each time the proper alignment of celestial bodies comes to pass.

The void crystal is attuned to the creature that wears its control ring, which is inherently linked to the ring at the center of the crystal. As a move action, a creature wearing the ring can trigger the crystal to discharge negative energy. This discharge fills the chamber, and deals 150 points of negative energy damage (Will DC 20 half). Undead creatures in the area of the discharge are healed of 150 points of damage. The reservoirs in the Dim Gate usually contain enough energy to power this discharge three times per week.

Also, a creature in control of the void crystal can use its necromantic energy to raise any creature killed by the discharge as an undead creature as if using animate dead, create undead, or create greater undead. The creature in control of the void crystal can control up to 30 HD of undead created in this manner.

Finally, a creature in control of the void crystal can use dimension door at will to travel to the collection chamber or the Dim Gate's control room.

Destruction

The void crystal can be destroyed by subjecting it to 16 continual hours of true sunlight without removing it from its receptacle in the collection chamber.
