Through the ancient tradition of the Sklar-Quah, you can protect both yourself and your mount from flame while traveling at high speeds.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat</a>, Ride 6 ranks, Handle Animal 6 ranks.

Benefit: As long as your mount travels at least 40 feet in a round, you gain fire resistance 3 for that round. You also receive a +4 bonus on all Reflex saves to avoid catching on fire and a +4 bonus on all Fortitude saves against choking on smoke (DMG 303). Each round, as a free action, you may confer the same bonuses to your mount with a successful DC 20 Ride check.
