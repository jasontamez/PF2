Corruptions









Corruptions

Even the most pure creature can succumb to tides of darkness. What begins as a minor malady or errant idea can grow into something malignant-a spreading corruption that can obscure your morals, cloud your judgment, and ultimately devour your soul. There are a number of different types of corruptions, from the hunger of vampirism to the horrifying transformation of the promethean. Living with a corruption is often a terrifying experience, but also offers the temptation of dark gifts. Hosts sometimes choose not to fight the corruption, but rather accept it and allow it to progress. These unfortunate folk either succumb to lust for the corruption's power or attempt to control the stain of corruption and use its gifts for some greater good.<a href="rules415e.html?Name=Corruption&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Corruptions.</a>

Strange powers exist on Golarion and beyond. Those who survive a brush with cosmic phenomena, occult mysteries, or horrors from beyond the veil occasionally find psychic abilities awakening in their minds. Although potent, such power corrupts the body, subconscious mind, and emotions-often with disastrous results.

The following corruption can be contracted by those who delve into occult lore better left forgotten.


Catalyst

A psychometabolic corruption is contracted as a result of experiencing extreme psychic trauma. When you contract this corruption, you gain a pool of psychometabolic power with a number of points equal to 1 + your manifestation level. These points are used to fuel the gifts of your manifestations. The pool replenishes at the start of each week or whenever you gain a new manifestation level.


Progression

The corruption is tied to your exposure to psychic power- the more you experience, the faster your progression advances. Whenever the total number of points in your psychometabolic pool reaches 0, you become afflicted with a random <a href="madnesses0d47.html?ItemName=All">madness</a> from the following list within the next 24 hours: <a href="madnesses1ee4.html?ItemName=Delirium">delirium</a>, <a href="madnessesa281.html?ItemName=Delusion">delusion</a>, <a href="madnessesfa8c.html?ItemName=Hallucination">hallucination</a>, <a href="madnessesaa94.html?ItemName=Mania">mania</a>, <a href="madnesses4f19.html?ItemName=Night%20Terrors">night terrors</a>, <a href="madnesses7317.html?ItemName=Paranoia">paranoia</a>, or <a href="madnessesc69a.html?ItemName=Phobia">phobia</a>. This affliction lasts 8 hours, after which you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or become twisted by your powers. You must also attempt this save when you are reduced to 10% or fewer of your maximum hit points by a psychic effect or when you fail a save against psychic effect by 5 or more. If you are unconscious or under the effects of <a href="spelldisplay6e9f.html?ItemName=calm%20emotions">calm emotions</a> for at least 6 of the hours that you spend afflicted with the madness, your corruption doesn't progress. However, the DC of checks to prevent your corruption from progressing increases by 2. These increases stack each time this occurs, and they last until your corruption reaches the next corruption stage.

Corruption Stage 1: The first time you fail a Will save (as described above), your powers twist your mind. You are constantly afflicted with one madness of the GM's choice from among those listed above. This madness can't be cured or removed while you have this corruption.

Corruption Stage 2: The second time you fail a Will save (as described above), your powers erode your values and morals and replace them with megalomaniacal thoughts. You gain the <a href="madnesses1367.html?ItemName=Moral%20Insanity">moral insanity</a> madness. This madness can't be cured or removed while you have this corruption.

Corruption Stage 3: The third time you fail a Will save (as described above), your body is twisted into a writhing mass of flesh that imprisons your mind. You become a <a href="monsterdisplayc88e.html?ItemName=Hungry%20Flesh">hungry flesh</a> under the GM's control, retaining all class levels and abilities that do not rely upon your original form.


Removing the Corruption

To remove the psychometabolic corruption, a psychic spellcaster whose caster level is at least double your manifestation level must eliminate your memories of gaining the corruption and your corruption stage advancing, such as by <a href="spelldisplayea0c-2.html?ItemName=modify%20memory">modify memory</a>, and then must cast <a href="spelldisplayfca1.html?ItemName=psychic%20surgery">psychic surgery</a> on you.


Manifestations
