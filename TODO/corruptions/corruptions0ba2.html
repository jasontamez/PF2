Corruptions









Corruptions

Even the most pure creature can succumb to tides of darkness. What begins as a minor malady or errant idea can grow into something malignant-a spreading corruption that can obscure your morals, cloud your judgment, and ultimately devour your soul. There are a number of different types of corruptions, from the hunger of vampirism to the horrifying transformation of the promethean. Living with a corruption is often a terrifying experience, but also offers the temptation of dark gifts. Hosts sometimes choose not to fight the corruption, but rather accept it and allow it to progress. These unfortunate folk either succumb to lust for the corruption's power or attempt to control the stain of corruption and use its gifts for some greater good.<a href="rules415e.html?Name=Corruption&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Corruptions.</a>

The pit of Hell waits for your damned soul.


Catalyst

The hellbound corruption typically takes hold as the result of an infernal contract with a diabolic patron or your fiendish blood. Your soul goes to Hell when you die, though you can be raised from the dead normally.


Progression

Your diabolic patron's portfolio determines what makes your corruption progress. When an opportunity to carry out a significant action that matches the devil's portfolio comes up, you are tempted to take it. The action might include oppressing people using your authority or tempting someone closer to lawful evil. You must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or succumb to temptation and perform the action. What counts as significant is up to the GM. Usually, an act that wouldn't harm anyone doesn't count. If something prevents you from performing this act, the GM chooses a time over the next week when you're compelled to further the cause of lawful evil.
Corruption Stage 1: The first time you perform a significant act that matches the devil's portfolio (either willingly or because you failed your save), your alignment shifts one step toward lawful evil (toward evil first, if you aren't yet evil). Any attempt to raise you from the dead requires a successful caster level check (DC = 15 + double your manifestation level).
Corruption Stage 2: The second time you perform such an act, your alignment shifts to lawful evil.
Corruption Stage 3: The third time you perform such an act, your contract comes due or you become a thrall to Hell-a living devil under the GM's control.


Removing the Corruption

Gaining release requires destroying your patron, retrieving the payment, and atoning.


Manifestations

The following are manifestations of the hellbound corruption.


Darkest Desires

Prerequisite: Manifestation level 9th.

Each time you get more or less what you wished for (GM's discretion), you must succeed at a Will save or your corruption progresses to the next stage.
Stain: Wishes you make from this manifestation's gift or your own spells are granted by your patron and interpreted from a devil's perspective. The patron always tries to twist your wish away from your intent and to its own dark ends.
Special: Upon receiving this manifestation, you must take both the gift and the stain, even with the useful corruption or vile corruption <a href="rules319c.html?Name=Corruption%20Variants&amp;Category=Manifestations">variants</a>.
