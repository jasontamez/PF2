Originally, only elves were allowed to join the Lantern Bearers, but with the destruction of the Winter Council and the group's new focus on openness, these restrictions have been abandoned. While elves still hold a majority in the organization and its base of operations remains in Kyonin, any who seek to further the group's goals are welcome as members. The same goes for those passionate about opposing demonic influences or threats from the Darklands. These dedicated soldiers and redeemers, called Lantern Bearers after the group that gave rise to them, form the backbone of that organization.

While Lantern Bearers direct the majority of their missions and goals in the Darklands, particularly in fighting against the machinations of the drow, they have increasingly turned to surface regions where demonic corruptions similar to those suffusing drow society have erupted. The primary focus is on the doorstep of their own homeland of Kyonin: the swampy realm of Tanglebriar, where the nascent demon lord Treerazer rules. The Worldwound has also seen a considerable number of Lantern Bearers joining the crusade, but they are increasingly encountered throughout the Inner Sea region, especially as drow agents and their influences on surface world interests become more and more apparent.

The following are class features of the Lantern Bearer prestige class.

Lantern Arcana (Sp) A Lantern Bearer gains a series of spell-like abilities. The Lantern Bearer's caster level for these effects is equal to her character level, and the save DC is equal to 10 + the spell's level + her Intelligence modifier. To use a spell-like ability, she must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell-like ability's spell level.

A Lantern Bearer gains additional abilities as she advances in level. When she initially gains access to a set of spell-like abilities of 1st or higher level, she can use each spell-like ability once per day. For every 2 class levels after she gains a specific set of spell-like abilities, she gains an additional use per day of each ability in that set. (For example, a 3rd-level Lantern Bearer can use darkvision, delay poison, and see invisibility each once per day, and faerie fire, pass without trace, and protection from evil each twice per day.)

At Will: Dancing lights, light, and spark.
1st Level: Faerie fire, pass without trace, and protection from evil.
3rd Level: Darkvision (self only), delay poison (self only), and see invisibility.
5th Level: Continual flame (3rd-level spell, lasts up to 10 minutes per level; a Lantern Bearer within 20 feet of a continual flame she created using this ability can extinguish it to cast searing light), dispel magic, and magic circle against evil (self only).
7th Level: Heightened daylight (heightened to a 4th-level spell), dimensional anchor, and freedom of movement (self only).

Luminous Potency (Su): When casting spells from other classes or using lantern arcana spell-like abilities, a Lantern Bearer gains an additional bonus equal to her Lantern Bearer class level on caster level checks for the purpose of overcoming spell resistance.

Bitter Armament (Su): At 2nd level, metal weapons wielded by a Lantern Bearer are treated as cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction (in addition to the weapons' other special material properties). These weapons, including fired ammunition, retain this property for 1 round after leaving the Lantern Bearer's grasp.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 2nd level, a Lantern Bearer selects a creature type from the following: aberration, animal, fey, humanoid (elf ), outsider (evil), and plant. This ability functions like the ranger class ability of the same name, and Lantern Bearer levels stack with other class levels that grant the favored enemy ability.

At 8th level, the Lantern Bearer can select an additional favored enemy from this list. In addition, the bonus against any one favored enemy from this list (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

Superior Discernment (Ex): At 3rd level, a Lantern Bearer gains one of the following as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites: Eagle Eyes, Elven Accuracy, or Sharp Senses.

Unbounded Stride (Su): At 4th level, as a swift action, a Lantern Bearer can make herself immune to effects that would impede her movement, such as overgrown foliage, solid fog, webs, or other magical area effects that impair movement or confer the entangled condition. This ability is similar in effect to a druid's woodland stride ability, but its benefits extend to magical effects as well. She takes no damage from moving through spiky vegetation, briars, or even a wall of thorns, but harmful gases and other detrimental effects, such as fire damage from an incendiary cloud, still affect her as normal. A Lantern Bearer can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level; these rounds need not be consecutive.

Proven Weapon Familiarity (Ex): At 5th level, a Lantern Bearer gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with composite longbows, composite shortbows, longbows, longswords, rapiers, shortbows, short swords, and any weapon with "elven" in its name.

Celestial Weaponry (Su): At 6th level, a Lantern Bearer's attacks are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Fade from Sight (Su): At 7th level, a Lantern Bearer can use the Stealth skill without having anything to hide behind, and even while being observed. Activating this ability is a swift action in addition to the action required to hide. A Lantern Bearer can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level; these rounds need not be consecutive.

Aiudara Alignment (Su): At 9th level, once per day as a fullround action, a Lantern Bearer can use the interconnected power of the aiudara (a series of magical portals sometimes called "elf gates") to teleport herself to an elf gate that she has studied carefully (as per the spell teleport). This functions as word of recall, but the Lantern Bearer can transport only herself plus 50 pounds of objects.

In addition, a Lantern Bearer can magically slip between the spaces in reality twice per day as a swift action, as if using dimension door. This ability has a range of 50 feet, and the Lantern Bearer cannot take other creatures with her.

Bringer of Brightness (Sp): At 10th level, once per day a Lantern Bearer can engulf herself in a brilliant radiance. This functions as a holy aura spell targeting only the Lantern Bearer, and uses the same formula for caster level and save DC as her lantern arcana.
