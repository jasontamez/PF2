Perhaps no group has done more to sow the seeds of freedom in devil-haunted Cheliax than the Bellflower Network, and no agents of that network do or risk more than its dedicated Bellflower tillers. Charged with freeing slaves from the infernal nation's many plantations and escorting them to the safety of Andoran and Rahadoum, Bellflower tillers are a constant thorn in the side of House Thrune and its diabolical minions. These elite liberators practice their craft all across Cheliax, from the darkened streets of Egorian and Westcrown to the wilds of the Whisperwood. Bellflower tillers employ farming euphemisms to mask their activities from unfriendly ears' referring to their secret hideouts as "barns," the slaves they escort as their "crops," and the secret paths they take as "rows." Excessive contact between Bellflower tillers is discouraged by the Bellflower Network's leadership, lest they risk exposing the organization to the authorities. Despite this, they often meet in secret to discuss which routes are safest to take, how much to bribe certain officials, and what tactics for organizing groups of slaves work best, and so improve chances of evading capture.

Nearly all Bellflower tillers are halfling rogues, though some particularly zealous members have levels in both rogue and inquisitors and savvy members might have levels in both rogue and ranger. Vigilantes are also a natural fit as Bellflower tillers. Non-halflings are usually admitted only after proving their allegiance to the anti-slavery movement and their goodwill toward halflings, but once they join the cause, they are incredibly valuable to the organization for the simple fact that their race does not immediately raise suspicion in areas where the Bellflower Network is active.

A Bellflower tiller's duty relies in part on her ability to establish a believable and viable cover identity. Many pose as traveling merchants or tinkerers-occupations that give them the freedom to get where they need to, when they need to-and have alibis for their presence on the road if confronted by Chelish patrols. Other Bellflower tillers join mercenary bands or adventuring groups, using their organizational and survival skills to help their companions in exchange for some extra muscle should a particular slave breakout proceed poorly.

The following are class features of the Bellflower tiller prestige class.

Bellflower Crop (Ex): As a standard action, a Bellflower tiller can designate a number of allies up to 3 + her Charisma modifier as part of her Bellflower crop. Members of a crop must remain within 30 feet of the Bellflower tiller to gain any benefits from abilities that affect a Bellflower crop, regardless of the ability's source (whether it's a Bellflower harvester, irrigator, or tiller). If any leave this range, the Bellflower tiller must designate these allies again for them to be included in her crop. At 7th level, this range increases to 60 feet.

Swift Sower (Ex): A Bellflower tiller's base land speed is treated as being +10 feet faster when determining her overland travel speed while traveling long distances and while outside of combat. Members of her Bellflower crop can use either the Bellflower tiller's overland travel speed or their own, whichever is better. At 6th level, the bonus to speed increases to +20 feet.

Crop Guardian (Ex): At 2nd level, whenever a Bellflower tiller uses the aid another action for a member of her Bellflower crop, she grants a +3 bonus instead of the normal +2. Levels in the Bellflower tiller prestige class stack with any vigilante levels she has when calculating the effects of the Bellflower harvester's crop vigilance ability (see page 42).

Scarecrow (Ex): At 2nd level, a Bellflower tiller receives a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures that threaten attacks of opportunity against members of her Bellflower crop. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 10th level.

Teamwork Feat: At 2nd level, a Bellflower tiller gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. This bonus feat must be a teamwork feat, and the Bellflower tiller must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat. At 6th level and 10th level, the Bellflower tiller gains an additional bonus teamwork feat.

Sneak Attack: At 3rd level, a Bellflower tiller gains a sneak attack that functions like the rogue class feature of the same name. The extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level and increases by 1d6 every 3 levels thereafter. If a Bellflower tiller gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

Favored Barn (Ex): At 5th level, a Bellflower tiller grows familiar with and develops trusted contacts in a particular community. While inside the limits of this community, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. Any ally designated as part of the Bellflower tiller's crop receives a bonus on these skills equal to half the tiller's bonus. A Bellflower tiller traveling through her favored community leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although she can leave a trail if she so desires).

Provided that she isn't in immediate danger (such as fleeing from pursuers right on her heels), a Bellflower tiller can always find a safe place for her and members of her crop to rest in her chosen community. At such a location, she and her allies are fed, clothed, and provided with basic medical attention (as if attended by a person with a Heal bonus of +10).

At 7th level and 9th level, the Bellflower tiller can select an additional community in which to receive these bonuses. Each time she selects a new community, the skill bonus and initiative bonus in any one chosen community (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

For the purposes of this ability, a community can be any settlement of 100 or more individuals. Outlying farms, fields, and houses are considered part of a community.
