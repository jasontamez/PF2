Though all faiths have their dedicated priests and righteous warriors, gods inspire devotion from a wide range of individuals. Rogues who specialize in stealth and poisons might swear allegiance to Norgorber, while wandering bards sing songs in praise of Desna. Even the most powerful deity is not too proud to turn such followers aside, for the worship of passionate acolytes is precious regardless of their backgrounds, professions, races, or ages, and they might lead others to the faith by example. These unusual but skillful followers of the gods are called evangelists.

An evangelist could have a childhood rooted in wealth or poverty, hail from the north or the south, and may have been raised in her faith or come to it late in life. She may follow one path strictly or dabble in multiple professions. She may be of any race and pledge her faith to any of the core deities. Of all the preeminent followers of the core deities, the evangelist is the hardest to predict and shows the most variety in her abilities.

Requirements

To qualify to become an evangelist, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.

Alignment: Within one step of chosen deity.
Deity: Must worship a single, specific deity.

The following are class features of the evangelist prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An evangelist is proficient with all simple weapons and light armor. An evangelist also gains weapon proficiency with her chosen deity's favored weapon.

Obedience (Ex): In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class, including all abilities gained from aligned class (see below), an evangelist must perform a daily obedience to her chosen deity (see the <a href="deitiesbygroup.html">deity's page</a> for more information).

Skilled: Evangelists possess a range of skills across multiple disciplines. At 1st level, an evangelist selects two skills to add to her class skill list. Once selected, these class skills can't be changed.

Aligned Class (Ex): Evangelists come from many different backgrounds, and they show an unusual range of diversity. At 2nd level, the evangelist must choose a class she belonged to before adding the prestige class to be her aligned class. She gains all the class features for this class, essentially adding every evangelist level beyond 1st to her aligned class to determine what class features she gains. She still retains the Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks of the prestige class, but gains all other class features of her aligned class as well as those of the evangelist prestige class.

Protective Grace (Su): The evangelist's chosen deity rewards her with heightened awareness and reaction skills, making her more difficult to strike in combat. At 2nd level, the evangelist gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 7th level. The evangelist loses this bonus when she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC.

Divine Boon: As the evangelist gains levels, she gains boons from her chosen deity. The nature of these boons varies depending on the evangelist's chosen deity. Each deity grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the evangelist gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the <a href="featdisplay78b6.html?ItemName=Deific%20Obedience">Deific Obedience</a> feat and her deity's description for details on these divine boons. When a divine boon grants a spell-like ability, the evangelist's caster level for the spell-like ability equals her total character level. This ability allows an evangelist to access these boons earlier than with the Deific Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.

Gift of Tongues: At 4th level, the evangelist may select a new language as a gift from her chosen deity. She gains the ability to speak and write this new language fluently, so as to better communicate with those she meets in the course of her travels. At 8th level, the evangelist selects a second language to learn. The ability to comprehend these languages is an instantaneous divine gift, and spells and effects that dispel persistent effects can't remove the evangelist's gift of tongues.

Multitude of Talents (Ex): The evangelist finds herself in many strange situations requiring a variety of skills. Starting at 5th level, the evangelist gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on any skill check attempted with a skill in which the character has no ranks. This bonus applies only to skill checks that can be made untrained.

Spiritual Form (Su): Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist gains the ability to assume a spiritual form. Assuming this form is a standard action, and the evangelist can remain in spiritual form for a number of minutes per day equal to her character level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Returning to her normal form is a free action.

The evangelist's spiritual form grants her telepathy to a range of 100 feet, as well as two variable abilities. Upon reaching 10th level, the evangelist must choose the form of these two abilities, and once she has selected them they can't be changed. First, she chooses one ability score to which she gains a +4 bonus when in spiritual form. Second, she chooses one physical transformation from the following to gain when she transforms: wings (fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or a single natural attack (a claw, bite, gore, slam, or tail sting that deals damage as appropriate for the evangelist's size) as well as a temporary appendage capable of making such an attack if necessary.
