Inner Sea Pirate

Pirates of the Inner Sea region sail many different bodies of water in search of plunder, from the most common Shackles pirates to the privateers of Andoran and the fast-moving brigands of the River Kingdoms. Those who prove handy on a ship might rise to the rank of captain and command their own ships. Inner Sea pirates are adept at both sailing and sword fighting, and most have looked death in the face more than once. They possess a variety of skills that prove useful when sailing and plundering, and two Inner Sea pirates might be quite different from each other.

Role: While many sailors in the waters around Avistan and Garund work as pirates, those experienced enough to take levels in this prestige class show more talent than do common deck hands. Inner Sea pirates often captain their own ships; those who do not usually serve as officers or aboard notorious ships under accomplished captains.

Alignment: Inner Sea pirates are often chaotic and rarely good, but can be any nonlawful alignment.

Requirements

To qualify to become an Inner Sea pirate, a character must fulfill all of the following criteria.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.
Skills: Appraise 5 ranks, Profession (sailor) 5 ranks, Swim 5 ranks.

The Inner Sea Pirate's class skills are Appraise (Int), Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Profession (sailor) (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at each Level: 6 + Int modifier.
Hit Die: d8.

The following are class features of the Inner Sea pirate prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An Inner Sea pirate gains proficiency with the cutlass, hook hand, rapier, and short sword. An Inner Sea pirate gains no armor proficiency.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at 4th level and every three levels thereafter. If an Inner Sea pirate gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the damage bonuses stack.

Pirate Talent: As an Inner Sea pirate develops her skill, she learns a number of tricks that aid her in her work. She gains a pirate trick at 4th level and every three levels thereafter. An Inner Sea pirate cannot select an individual trick more than once.

Tricks marked with an asterisk add effects to an Inner Sea pirate's sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack, and the decision must be made before the attack roll is made.

Classic Duelist (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls made with a cutlass, rapier, or short sword.

Deep Breath (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to three times her Constitution modifier before she must start making Constitution checks.

Drink for Free (Ex): This ability presumes that the Inner Sea pirate is admired or feared in the taverns she frequents. The Inner Sea pirate designates one tavern per Inner Sea pirate level as a "favored tavern." When in a favored tavern, the Inner Sea pirate drinks for free. In addition, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks within a favored tavern.

Farseer (Ex): Pirates take turns serving as lookouts. An Inner Sea pirate with this ability reduces any distancebased penalties on Perception checks by half when she is at least 10 feet off the ground or above the deck of a ship.

Hand Stab* (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate can weaken an opponent's weapon hand by hitting with a sneak attack. When she deals sneak attack damage against an opponent, that opponent becomes easier to disarm. Until the end of the rogue's next turn, anyone attempting to disarm that opponent gains a +2 bonus on the disarm attempt.

Quick Appraise (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate must at times quickly select the most valuable items to spirit away. She appraises an item as a move action and can determine the most valuable item in a treasure hoard as a standard action.

Rigging Monkey (Ex): Some pirates become skilled at climbing on ropes and rigging. This ability grants the Inner Sea pirate a +2 bonus on Climb checks when using a rope to help her climb. In addition, when using a rope to help her climb, the Inner Sea pirate can move at half her speed. (By accepting a -5 penalty she can move at her normal speed.)

Storm Sailor (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate treats all storms as if they were one category less severe for the purposes of sailing and navigation. (This benefit stacks with the Hurricane Savvy character trait and other effects related to wind conditions.) She can make an Acrobatics check to move her normal speed across uneven ground, and she does not take a penalty on any Acrobatics checks due to slightly slippery, slightly unsteady, or moderately unsteady conditions.

Windrigger (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate has learned the tricky art of tacking. With a DC 15 Profession (sailor) check, she increases her ship's base movement by 5 feet for 1 hour.

Advanced Tricks: At 6th, 8th, and 9th level, an Inner Sea pirate can choose one of the following advanced tricks in place of a pirate trick.

Burst of Speed (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate has learned to coax speed out of her ship when it really counts. With a DC 20 Profession (sailor) check, she doubles her ship's base movement for 1 round. She can use this ability once per day.

Defensive Climber (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC when climbing.

Fearsome Advance* (Ex): If the Inner Sea pirate deals damage with her sneak attack, she can make an Intimidate check as an immediate action to demoralize the damaged opponent.

Foot Sweep* (Ex): The Inner Sea pirate has learned to sweep her opponents' legs when they are reeling from the pain of her precise attacks. If the Inner Sea pirate deals damage with a sneak attack, she can make a trip attack against the damaged opponent as an immediate action. All the usual rules for trip attacks apply, and feats such as Improved Trip modify the attack normally.

Shipboard Authority (Ex): As a full-round action once per day, the Inner Sea pirate can shout orders to her crew. All allies within 30 feet of the Inner Sea pirate who can hear her gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls or on a particular skill check for 1 round per the Inner Sea pirate's level. The Inner Sea pirate specifies which bonus applies when she uses this ability and may not change the bonus for the duration of this ability.
