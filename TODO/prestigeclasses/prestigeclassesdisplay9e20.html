The following are class features of this prestige class.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At the indicated levels, a diabolist gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before she became a diabolist, she must decide to which class she adds each level of diabolist for the purpose of determining spells per day.

Damned (Ex): When a diabolist is killed, her soul is instantly sent to Hell. A character attempting to resurrect her must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the diabolist's level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the diabolist again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do so.

Imp Familiar (Ex): A diabolist forms a close bond with a particular imp, similar to how a wizard gains a familiar. This functions as the arcane bond wizard class feature, but as if the diabolist had selected the Improved Familiar feat. If a diabolist has class levels in another class that grants a familiar, levels in that class and her diabolist class levels stack for determining the overall abilities of her imp familiar. The imp familiar can communicate with its master via telepathy as long as the imp is in physical contact with her.

At 5th level, the diabolist's imp familiar can choose any of the following spells to add to its list of at-will spell-like abilities: bleed, deathwatch, detect evil, detect law, doom, ghost sound, mage hand, message, open/close, or prestidigitation. The imp can also add any of the following spells to its list of 1/day spell-like abilities: curse water, floating disk, grease, hold portal, identify, silent image, unseen servant, or ventriloquism. The range of the imp's telepathy with the diabolist increases to 60 feet.

At 8th level, the imp can choose two more at-will spell-like abilities from the corresponding list above, and it can choose one more 1/day spell-like ability from the corresponding list above. The range of the imp's telepathy with the diabolist increases to 1 mile.

Infernal Charisma (Ex): A diabolist gains a +2 bonus on Charisma checks to interact with devils. This bonus increases to +4 at 4th level and to +6 at 7th level.

Obedience (Ex): In order to maintain her diabolist abilities (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by the class), a diabolist must indulge her chosen patron with a daily obedience. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the diabolist uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to an archdevil, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of diabolist, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her diabolic patron. This choice determines which category of boons she earns as she gains levels, and once made, it cannot later be changed.

Channel Hellfire (Su): At 2nd level, a diabolist can alter spells that deal energy damage to instead deal hellfire damage (see page 136). She can do this as a free action a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Spells altered to use hellfire gain the lawful and evil descriptors.

Infernal Bargain (Ex): At 2nd level, a diabolist making use of planar ally (or a similar spell) can attempt an opposed Charisma check against a called (but not summoned) devil. If she succeeds, the devil reduces the price it demands to serve her by half.

Augment Summoning (Ex): At 3rd level, a diabolist gains the Augment Summoning feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.

Diabolic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su): As a diabolist gains levels, she gains boons from her infernal patron. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the diabolist's chosen patron and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each diabolic patron grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the diabolist gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the archdevil, infernal duke, and malebranche descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a diabolic boon grants a spell-like ability, the diabolist's caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a diabolist to access these boons earlier than normal; it doesn't grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.

Heresy (Ex): At 3rd level, a diabolist gains a +2 bonus on checks to research specific devils' sigils or true names. This bonus increases to +4 at 9th level.

Hellish Soul (Ex): At 5th level, a diabolist has been deemed useful enough to the cause of Hell to be allowed a brief respite from damnation. If killed by any means outside of the will of Asmodeus, the archdevils, or another influential force in Hell, the diabolist can be resurrected as normal.

Infernal Transport (Sp): At 6th level, a diabolist can transport herself through Hell in a burst of flames. She can use this ability twice per day as per dimension door, or she can expend both uses to travel as per teleport. She cannot use this ability to enter or leave areas warded against evil creatures.

Hellfire Ray (Sp): At 8th level, a diabolist can cast hellfire ray (see page 184) twice per day as a spell-like ability.

Master Conjurer (Ex): At 10th level, when a diabolist calls a devil whose name she knows, she can cast the calling spell as a standard action and bargain with the devil as a move action. She adds half her Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate modifier to the bargaining Charisma check (if any).
