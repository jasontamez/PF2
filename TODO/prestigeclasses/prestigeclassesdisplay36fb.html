Although most of Sarenrae's worshipers seek to aid others or seek out those villains who can be redeemed, a rare few instead raise their eyes in awe of the greatest of Sarenrae's gifts to mortals: the sun. These Dawnflower anchorites hope to receive enlightenment in their retreat to the wilds so that they can, some day, return to civilization and use their newfound grace to help heal the church's wounds.

The following are the class features of the Dawnflower anchorite prestige class.

Solar Invocation (Su): A Dawnflower anchorite can harness the sun's life-giving warmth to protect the innocent and smite the wicked. At 1st level, he can invoke the sun as a standard action, granting him a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against evil creatures and adding 1 to the DC of his spells and domain powers (if any) against evil creatures. The bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 9th level. If a Dawnflower anchorite has an animal companion, the companion also gains the competence bonus on attack and damage rolls while this ability is active.

A Dawnflower anchorite can invoke the sun for a number of rounds per day equal to twice his Dawnflower anchorite class level + his Charisma modifier. Maintaining this ability on subsequent rounds is a free action. These bonuses apply only when the Dawnflower anchorite is standing in an outdoor area of dim light, normal light, or bright light, and only while he is clearly presenting his holy symbol or any scimitar.

At 5th level, a Dawnflower anchorite can invoke the sun as a move action instead of a standard action. At 10th level, he can invoke the sun as a swift action.

Credence: Each Dawnflower anchorite develops a personal credence that guides his worship of Sarenrae. He gains a credence at 2nd level and again every 2 class levels thereafter. Each credence can be chosen only once unless noted otherwise.

Dervish Dance: The Dawnflower anchorite gains Dervish Dance as a bonus feat.

Divine Light (Su): The Dawnflower anchorite can use solar invocation indoors or underground, provided he is in an area of dim light, normal light, or bright light. He can use solar invocation 2 additional rounds per day.

Extra Invocations (Ex): The Dawnflower anchorite can use solar invocation for twice as many rounds per day as normal.

Focused Class Feature: Choose one of the following class features: animal companion, bane, bardic performance, blessings, channel energy, domain, favored enemy, favored terrain, sacred weapon, or wild shape. The character adds his Dawnflower anchorite class levels to his effective class level in one class of his choice for the purpose of determining the effects of the chosen class feature. This credence can be selected twice, but the Dawnflower anchorite must select a different class feature each time.

Shining Servants: The Dawnflower anchorite gains Sunlight Summons as a bonus feat.

Solar Defense (Su): While using solar invocation, the Dawnflower anchorite adds his competence bonus on attack rolls to his Armor Class as a sacred bonus and to Ref lex saving throws as a dodge bonus. The Dawnflower anchorite can select this credence twice-the second time he does so, the bonus to Armor Class and on Ref lex saves also applies to any companions who gain bonuses from the Dawnflower anchorite's solar invocation.

Solar Weapons (Su): While using solar invocation, the Dawnflower anchorite can select one weapon (natural or manufactured) wielded by a creature affected by his solar invocation. That weapon gains the flaming weapon special ability for as long as the Dawnflower anchorite's solar invocation persists. A Dawnflower anchorite can select this credence twice-the second time he does so, the credence grants the flaming burst special ability instead of flaming to the selected weapon. At 5th level, the Dawnflower anchorite can grant two weapons this ability; at 10th level, he can grant up to three weapons this ability.

Sun Blade (Su): Any weapon wielded by the Dawnflower anchorite is treated having the undead-bane special ability against undead who are particularly harmed by sunlight. Ranged weapons impart this ability to any ammunition fired from the weapon. All weapons wielded by the Dawnflower anchorite shed light as per a sunrod, unless the Dawnflower anchorite chooses to suppress this light as a move action (the light activates again automatically the next time the anchorite draws the weapon).

Sun's Mercy (Su): Any creature that gains a competence bonus on attack rolls from the Dawnflower anchorite's solar invocation can deal nonlethal damage with a lethal weapon without taking the usual -4 penalty on attack rolls.

Bask in Radiance (Su): At 3rd level, when a Dawnflower anchorite uses his solar invocation ability, he can designate any number of allies within 30 feet to gain the bonuses granted by solar invocation for as long as he maintains the ability.

Sunbeam (Sp): At 7th level, a Dawnflower anchorite gains the ability to cast sunbeam once per day as a spell-like ability. His caster level is equal to his Hit Dice, and the save DC is Charisma-based. At 10th level, the Dawnflower anchorite can use this ability twice per day.

Dawnflower Invocation (Su): At 10th level, a Dawnflower anchorite is able to, once per day, use his solar invocation ability for 1 minute. The Dawnflower anchorite can also use this ability indoors or underground. While using Dawnflower invocation, all bonuses gained from solar invocation increase by 1. Using this ability doesn't cost rounds per day of solar invocation.
