The empyreal lord Pulura, the Shimmering Maiden, is said to dance among the lights of the aurora. Some of her worshipers seek her guidance in the starry skies, attuning themselves to the constellations of the Cosmic Caravan (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Occult Mysteries 36). Beyond the stargazers' interests in the heavens, though, they also train for the inevitable conf lict with demons. Pulura's bastion of worship in the Inner Sea region has traditionally been in the land of Sarkoris, which was consumed from within by the Worldwound at the advent of the Age of Lost Omens. Many of Pulura's worshipers perished during that disastrous invasion from the Abyss, but those who survived remained behind and, over the past several decades, have grown in power. This prestige class's specific defenses against demons and their ilk are a relatively recent addition to the traditions of the Puluran stargazer, but have served her worshipers well in helping them defend what little land they still control in the demon-blighted wastes of the Worldwound.

Below are the class features of the stargazer prestige class.

Guiding Light (Su): The stargazer gains a familiar, treating his stargazer level as his wizard level.

Mystery Magic (Ex): At 1st and 9th levels, the stargazer gains a hex from the witch's list of hexes. His stargazer levels count as (and stack with) witch levels when determining the effects of hexes. In addition, the stargazer adds all hexes available to a shaman with the heavens spirit (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 40) to the witch list.

At 3rd level, the stargazer gains the Stars subdomain in addition to any domains he already has. His stargazer levels count as (and stack with) cleric levels when determining which domain abilities he gains and their effects. If he isn't a cleric, the subdomain's spells are added to his class spell list (if necessary) and to his spells known, spellbook, familiar, or similar source. Spells added this way may be cast only once per day, unless using the stars are right ability. He can use the stars are right ability regardless of his spellcasting class.

A stargazer gains certain abilities from the heavens oracle mystery (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Advanced Player's Guide 48) as he gains levels as well. At 5th level, the stargazer gains the coat of many stars oracle revelation. At 7th level, he gains the star chart revelation. His stargazer levels and cleric levels count as (and stack with) oracle levels when he is determining the effects of these revelations.

Sidereal Arcana (Su or Sp): As he studies the skies, the stargazer binds himself to constellations from the Cosmic Caravan, drawing on their unearthly power. At 2nd level and every 2 class levels thereafter, the stargazer gains one sidereal arcana of his choice from the list below.

The Bridge: The stargazer is warded against winter's darkness. He gains cold resistance 5 and darkvision with a range of 30 feet. The stargazer can see through darkness created by demons without penalty.

The Daughter: The Daughter emboldens hearts with the promise of springtime and new life. The stargazer and allies within 10 feet gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear, and the DC to demoralize them via Intimidate increases by 4. The stargazer is immune to fear effects created by demons.

The Follower: The specter of death follows the stargazer, shielding him from doom. The stargazer gains a +4 bonus on saves against death effects. In addition, he is immune to all death effects, negative energy effects, and negative levels created by demons.

The Lantern Bearer: The stargazer's ability to conjure light increases. The radius of any light source he creates via magic increases by 10 feet, and its spell level is considered to be 2 higher.

The Mother: The stargazer channels the nurturing heart of the Caravan. Whenever the stargazer casts a cure spell, casts breath of life, or uses the healing hex, he adds twice his class level to the hit points restored. If the stargazer is a cleric with channel positive energy, his stargazer levels stack with his cleric levels to determine its effects.

The Newlyweds: The sign of intertwined lovers grants the stargazer a romantic mystique. Whenever he uses a charm or language-dependent effect against someone who could be romantically attracted to him, the save DC increases by 2. In addition, he gains a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against such individuals. Finally, the stargazer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects created by demons.

The Pack: The stargazer becomes attuned to the beasts that follow the Caravan. He gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks. In addition, whenever he casts a summoning spell that conjures multiple creatures of the animal type, he summons an additional animal of that type.

The Patriarch: The stargazer gains an innate sense of direction. He always knows which way north lies, and gains a +4 bonus on skill checks made to navigate or find his way. The stargazer also becomes immune to maze and similar effects.

The Rider: The stargazer can conjure a steed that deters those who would harm him. Once per day, the stargazer can use phantom steed as a spell-like ability; this spell-like ability has the light descriptor, and only the stargazer can ride the mount. The steed is made of starlight, and sheds light as a torch. While riding his star-steed, he is under the effects of sanctuary heightened to 4th level; if he breaks this sanctuary, he can reactivate it after 1 minute. The caster level of these effects is equal to his character level.

The Stargazer: The constellation that shares his name warns the stargazer of danger. The stargazer gains a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks and is not considered flat-footed before he acts in combat, although this does not allow him to act if he could not otherwise do so.

The Stranger: The stargazer learns to blend seamlessly into others' cultures. He can use cultural adaptation as a spell-like ability three times per day with a caster level equal to his character level. While under the effects of this ability, details of his body's appearance change as well, making him physically appear as the appropriate race or ethnicity (although his statistics do not change).

The Thrush: The stargazer's voice becomes harmonious. The stargazer gains a bonus equal to half his class level on Diplomacy and Perform (sing) checks.

The Wagon: The stargazer's movement becomes swift and steady. He gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his movement speed, and can take 5-foot steps in difficult terrain. In addition, three times per day as a swift action, he can gain the effects of freedom of movement for 1 round, but only against effects created by demons.

Stars' Dance (Ex): At 10th level, the stargazer's mastery of the Cosmic Caravan reaches its zenith. Once per day, the stargazer can replace one of his sidereal arcana with any other one. The new sidereal arcana can also be replaced using this ability, but the change is otherwise permanent.
