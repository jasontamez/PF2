The following are class features of the Daggermark poisoner prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Daggermark poisoner gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.

Master Poisoner (Ex): A Daggermark poisoner adds 1/2 her level on Craft (alchemy) checks dealing with poison. In addition, she can use Craft (alchemy) to change the type of a poison with 1 hour of work and an alchemist's lab. If the Craft (alchemy) check (DC equals the poison's save DC) is successful, the poison's type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury; on a failed check, the poison is ruined.

Poison Resistance (Ex): A Daggermark poisoner gains a +2 bonus on saves against poison, increasing to +4 at 4th level, +6 at 7th level, and total immunity at 9th level. Alchemist levels stack with Daggermark poisoner levels when determining the effect of this ability.

Quick Poisoning (Ex): A Daggermark poisoner can poison a weapon as a move action. She can create poisons with the Craft (alchemy) skill in half the normal amount of time.

Toxic Apothecary (Ex and Sp): At 2nd level, a Daggermark poisoner can use detect poison at will (range 5 feet, caster level equal to the Daggermark poisoner's class level) as a swift action. She gains a bonus equal to 1/2 her class level on Heal checks dealing with poison, and on a successful check she adds this bonus to the save bonus she provides her patient against the treated poison.

Toxic Trick: At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, a Daggermark poisoner learns a toxic trick. She can use a number of toxic tricks each day equal to her Intelligence modifier + 1/2 her class level. The save DC of any saving throw called for by a toxic trick is equal to 10 + the Daggermark poisoner's class level + her Intelligence modifier. Spell-like abilities have a caster level equal to her class level.

Choking Bomb (Su): As the ninja trick (Ultimate Combat 15), but with a DC as noted above.

Combine Poison (Ex): A Daggermark poisoner can combine two different poisons without reducing their efficacy, applying them to the same weapon, object, or trap. A creature exposed to the poisons must save against both.

Concentrate Poison (Su): As the alchemist discovery (Advanced Player's Guide 29).

Launch Trap (Ex): As the ranger's trapper archetype class feature (Ultimate Magic 65).

Poison Bomb (Ex or Su): As the ninja trick (Ultimate Combat 15). A Daggermark poisoner must possess the smoke bomb toxic trick before selecting this trick.

Poison Conversion (Su): As the alchemist discovery (Ultimate Combat 24).

Poison Trap (Ex or Su): As the ranger trap (Ultimate Magic 64).

Slow-Acting Poison (Ex): When crafting a poison, a Daggermark poisoner may choose to create it with a delayed onset time. This delay must be at least 1 round but cannot be longer than 1 minute per class level.

Smoke Bomb (Ex or Su): As the ninja trick (Ultimate Combat 16), but no ki points are required.

Tailored Toxin (Ex): Choose one creature type (and subtype, for humanoids or outsiders). Poisons a Daggermark poisoner uses are particularly effective against creatures of this type, increasing the save DC by 2. This trick can be taken more than once; each time it applies to a different creature type (or subtype).

Toxic Magic (Sp): Choose one of the following spells or alchemical extracts as a spell-like ability: accelerate poison, delay poison, pernicious poison, transmute potion to poison, or venomous bolt. This trick can be taken more than once; each time it grants a different spell-like ability.

Toxic Manufactory (Ex): At 3rd level, when creating poisons or antitoxins a Daggermark poisoner can create a number of doses equal to her Intelligence modifier at one time (minimum 1). These additional doses do not increase the time required, but do increase the raw material cost accordingly. In addition, she uses the item's gp value as its sp value when determining progress made with her Craft (alchemy) checks. If the Daggermark poisoner has the Master AlchemistAPG feat, she may create a number of doses of poison or antitoxin at one time equal to twice her Intelligence modifier and uses the item's pp value as its sp value when determining progress with her Craft (alchemy) checks.

Trapster (Ex): At 3rd level, a Daggermark poisoner adds her class level on Perception skill checks made to locate traps and on Craft and Disable Device checks made with poisonous traps. A Daggermark poisoner also adds a +1 bonus on attack rolls, save DCs, and Perception and Disable Device DCs for poisoned traps she creates. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and again at 9th level.

Sneak Attack (Ex): This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at 5th level and again at 10th. If a Daggermark poisoner gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.

Treacherous Toxin (Ex): At 5th level, when a Daggermark poisoner makes a sneak attack with a poisoned weapon, she may forgo some of her sneak attack damage to increase the save DC of her poison, increasing the poison's save DC by 1 for every 1d6 points of sneak attack damage she forgoes.

Swift Poisoning (Ex): At 6th level, a Daggermark poisoner can draw a vial of poison from her bag and apply it to a weapon as a swift action. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity as long as she has at least one hand free.

Instantaneous Toxicology (Ex): At 8th level, a Daggermark poisoner can create a poison as a full-round action if she succeeds at the Craft (alchemy) check and has the appropriate resources on hand to pay the creation cost. Poisons crafted in this way last up 10 minutes per class level before losing their potency. In addition, she can instead create an unstable toxin. An unstable toxin costs 1/10 its normal price (rather than 1/3), but is ruined if not used by the end of her next turn.
