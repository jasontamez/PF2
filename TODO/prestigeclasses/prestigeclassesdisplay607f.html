While Kurgess's faithful thrive in sporting arenas, they understand that nature itself creates the greatest obstacle courses. The athletic fanatics known as darechasers seek out these untamed obstacles as challenges against which to test their strength. In order to continue improving, darechasers must often resort to besting their own records. Sometimes a darechaser will even bet against herself, only to strain to prove herself wrong and amaze bystanders. Darechasers travel widely and delight in both officiating competitions and performing physical feats that inspire a new generation of athleticism. Some even go so far as to use sports as a form of diplomacy, settling disputes with athletic competitions.

Below are the class features of the darechaser prestige class.

Adrenaline Rush (Ex): A darechaser can call upon her inner reserves of strength and speed as a free action to overcome otherwise insurmountable obstacles. A darechaser can harness this energy for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + her Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, she can use adrenaline rush for an additional 2 rounds. Temporary increases to Constitution do not allow her to use this ability for additional rounds per day. If she has the rage class feature, she can expend rounds of rage to activate and sustain her adrenaline rush (e.g. for making Constitution checks).

While experiencing an adrenaline rush, a darechaser gains a +1 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, Constitution, Dexterity, Escape Artist, Ride, Strength, and Swim checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter (maximum +5).

A darechaser can end her adrenaline rush as a free action and is fatigued afterward for a number of rounds equal to double the number of rounds she used this ability. A darechaser can't begin an adrenaline rush while fatigued or exhausted. If she falls unconscious, she can choose to continue her adrenaline rush.

Dare (Ex): As a swift action while using her adrenaline rush, a darechaser can expend a round of her adrenaline rush to dare herself to accomplish a great deed. Although many announce these dares aloud, the ability functions as long as she can coherently and mentally articulate her dare; she cannot use this ability while confused, dazed, stunned, or panicked. She can use it while using the rage class feature, but only if she loudly announces the dare (treat this as having audible components-it can be defeated by magical silence). Once she declares her dare, the darechaser can add 1d6 to the result of any one attack roll, saving throw, or other check that directly helps her fulfill the dare. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she can roll another 1d6 and add it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At 5th level, she can instead add 1d8 to the result of one check to fulfill a dare, rolling an additional die only if she rolls a natural 8. At 10th level, she can instead add 1d10 to the result of one check, rolling an additional die only if she rolls a natural 10.

A darechaser thrives on challenging herself to accomplish difficult goals, and she receives little satisfaction when fulfilling easy objectives. If her check succeeded only because of the additional die's (or dice's) result, she benefits from one of the following effects (chosen by her) immediately after fulfilling the dare. If she succeeds at the check despite the added die's result, she gains no additional benefit.

Daring Endurance: The darechaser immediately gains temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + her class level. These temporary hit points last for the duration of her adrenaline rush and stack with any temporary hit points granted by the unstoppable adrenaline deed.

Daring Finish: The darechaser doesn't become fatigued if she ends her adrenaline rush before the end of her next turn.

Daring Persistence: The darechaser immediately regains 1d2 rounds of her adrenaline rush ability.

Adrenaline Deed (Ex): As a darechaser gains experience, she learns to leverage her adrenaline in new ways. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, she gains an adrenaline deed from the following list that grants her additional benefits while she is using her adrenaline rush ability. She can't choose an individual adrenaline deed more than once.

Dare-Driven: If the darechaser adds 1d8 to a roll as a part of a dare, she can roll again and add the result if she rolls a natural 7 or 8 (not just an 8). If she rolls 1d10, she instead rolls again on a result of a natural 9 or 10.

Diehard Performer: The darechaser adds her adrenaline rush bonus on all Perform checks and performance combat checks (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 153).

Impossible Speed: The darechaser's base speed increases by 10 feet. At 6th level, her speed instead increases by 20 feet, and at 10th level it increases by 30 feet.

Mounted Adrenaline: The darechaser shares the base effects of her adrenaline surge (but not any adrenaline deeds) with her mount, as long as the darechaser is mounted on it or adjacent to it.

Powerful Climber: The darechaser gains a natural climb speed equal to her land speed.

Powerful Leaper: The darechaser always counts as having a running start when jumping, and she triples her adrenaline rush bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump. Powerful Swimmer: The darechaser gains a natural swim speed equal to her land speed.

Unstoppable: When the darechaser begins her adrenaline rush, she gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 2 ?? her class level. These temporary hit points last for the duration of her adrenaline rush. In addition, she doubles her adrenaline rush bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize while dying.

Untouchable: The darechaser gains a +1 dodge bonus to her Armor Class. At 6th level this increases to +2, and at 10th level it increases to +3.

Record Breaker (Ex): At 10th level, a darechaser can push herself to surpass known mortal limits. Once per day, she can use her dare ability to add 2 ?? the normal number of bonus dice to a d20 roll. If she applies this benefit to a check modified by her adrenaline rush, she instead rolls and adds 3 ?? the number of bonus dice.
