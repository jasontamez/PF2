All the following are class features of the Pathfinder field
agent prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Pathfinder field
agent gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.

Pathfinder Training: A Pathfinder field agent receives
additional training that aids her in her fulfilling her duty
to explore, report, and cooperate. She can't receive the
same training more than once unless otherwise noted.
A Pathfinder field agent gains additional Pathfinder
training at 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter.

Animal Magnetism (Ex): This ability functions as the druid's
wild empathy class ability, except the Pathfinder field agent's
effective druid level to determine her wild empathy bonus is
equal to her Pathfinder field agent level. Levels in Pathfinder
field agent stack with levels from other classes that grant
wild empathy for the purpose of determining a Pathfinder
field agent's total wild empathy bonus.

Deft Defender (Ex): When the Pathfinder field agent
successfully uses the aid another action to increase an
ally's Armor Class, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to her AC
until the start of her next turn.

Eidetic Memory (Ex): Years of training in the libraries
of countless Pathfinder lodges have given the Pathfinder
field agent extraordinary recall. A Pathfinder field agent
with this training adds half her class level (minimum 1) to
all Knowledge skill checks and can attempt all Knowledge
skill checks untrained.

Greater Casting: The Pathfinder field agent gains
new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a
spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the
prestige class. She doesn't gain other benefits of that
class other than spells per day, spells known, and an
increased caster level. If the Pathfinder field agent has
levels in more than one spellcasting class, she must
choose which class to apply this increase to when she
takes this Pathfinder training.

Know Thy Enemy (Ex): The Pathfinder field agent can
select one creature type, and gains a +5 bonus on Knowledge
checks to identify creatures of the chosen type. This can be
taken more than once, and applies to a different creature
type each time.

Rogue Talent: The Pathfinder field agent can select any
rogue talent for which she qualifies.

Skill Specialization (Ex): The Pathfinder field agent can
select any skill to become a class skill for her. In addition,
she gains a bonus on checks with the chosen skill equal
to half her class level. This training can be selected more
than once, applying to a different skill each time it is taken.

Sneak Attack +1d6 (Ex): This ability is exactly like the
rogue ability of the same name. If the Pathfinder field
agent gains a sneak attack bonus from another source,
the bonuses on damage stack. A Pathfinder field agent
must be at least 3rd level before selecting this training.

Trapfinding: This training functions as the rogue class
feature of the same name. Levels in Pathfinder field
agent stack with levels from other classes that grant this
ability for the purpose of determining a Pathfinder field
agent's total trapfinding bonus.

Wayfinder Upgrade: At 1st level and every 3 levels
thereafter, a Pathfinder field agent can add an additional
ability to her wayfinder. These abilities must be added to
a standard wayfinder (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The
Inner Sea World Guide 299), not to a variant or modified
wayfinder (though a Pathfinder field agent can possess
more than one wayfinder at a time, if she chooses). If a
Pathfinder field agent loses her upgraded wayfinder, she
can purchase a new one at the normal cost plus 100 gp for
each Pathfinder field agent level she possesses, keeping all
previously selected upgrades. A Pathfinder field agent can
choose from the listed wayfinder upgrades. Any upgrades
that grant additional spell effects use the wayfinder's caster
level or the Pathfinder field agent's class level (whichever
is higher) to determine effects that depend on caster level.

Dancing Lights: The Pathfinder replaces her wayfinder's
ability to cast light with the ability to cast dancing lights at will.

Daylight: Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent
can use her wayfinder to cast daylight. This upgrade can
be selected more than once. Each additional time it's
selected, the Pathfinder field agent gains another use of
the spell per day.

Flask: A hidden compartment is carved into the
wayfinder's casing, allowing a single potion, oil, or dose
of poison to be hidden within. This substance can be
retrieved with a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks
of opportunity (as opposed to the normal move action
required to retrieve a stored item). Drinking the potion or
applying the oil or poison still requires a standard action
that provokes attacks of opportunity. The Pathfinder field
agent gains a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made
to oppose the Perception check of someone observing or
frisking her to detect items in the hidden compartment.

Hidden: In order to hide her affiliation with the
Pathfinder Society from potential enemies, a Pathfinder
field agent with this upgrade can, three times per day, turn
her wayfinder invisible and mask its magical aura as if it
were under the effects of invisibility and magic aura. Each
time this effect is used, it lasts for up to 1 hour per 2 class
levels the Pathfinder field agent possesses (minimum 1
hour), and can be dismissed by the Pathfinder field agent
as a move action.

Message: In addition to the light spell-like ability, the
wayfinder can be used to cast message at will.


Shielding: Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can
activate her wayfinder to gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC
for a number of minutes equal to her Pathfinder field
agent level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class
levels the Pathfinder field agent possesses.


Silence: Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can use her
wayfinder to emit an aura of silence, as the spell. The silence
effect must be centered on the wayfinder. This upgrade can be
selected more than once. Each additional time the upgrade
is selected, the agent gains another use of the spell per day.

Stabilize: The wayfinder can be used to cast stabilize at will.

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter,
a Pathfinder field agent can select a bonus feat. Each of
these bonus feats must be Skill Focus or a teamwork feat.
The Pathfinder field agent must meet the prerequisites
of the selected bonus feat.

Legends Uncovered (Su): At 10th level, a Pathfinder field
agent has the ability to uncover the secrets of the distant
past. Once per day when studying or researching a person,
place, or artifact of antiquity, the agent can dedicate herself
to the task to gain benefits as though she were casting the
spell legend lore.
