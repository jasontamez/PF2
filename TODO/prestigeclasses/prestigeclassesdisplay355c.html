The following are class features of the Westcrown devil prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Westcrown devil gains proficiency with longswords.

Classically Trained (Ex): The god Aroden's return to Westcrown was long foretold, but when he died instead and prophecy proved unreliable, the citizens of Westcrown had to adapt. Today, Westcrown honors Aroden's legacy with memorial statues, cathedrals, and other remembrances. The Council of Thieves, for its part, trains its members with Aroden's favored weapon, the longsword-a weapon the god used to great effect by eschewing strength for finesse and expertise. A Westcrown devil can use Weapon Finesse with a longsword sized for him when he wields it one-handed, even though it is not a light weapon.

Founders' Favor (Su): A group known as the founders of Aroden are the patrons of Westcrown. So strong are the traditions this group imprinted on the city that even Cheliax's relatively recent dedication to the Prince of Darkness has not effaced their mark upon the City of Twilight. A Westcrown devil learns to call upon the founders' spiritual power, enjoying a mastery of the city matched by few.

At 1st level, a Westcrown devil gains a pool of favor points equal to his class level + his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). In addition to the powers inspired by specific founders (see below), the Westcrown devil can spend one favor point to add a bonus equal to half her class level (minimum +1) on a skill check without spending an action. The Westcrown devil must use this ability before learning the result of the check, and he can add this additional bonus only once per skill check. The pool of favor is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest.

As the Westcrown devil gains levels, he learns to call upon powers inspired by specific founders. The caster level of spell-like abilities used this way is equal to the character's class level. Effects (including spell-like abilities) that allow a saving throw have a DC equal to 10 + the Westcrown devil's class level + the Westcrown devil's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).

Eye of Vadrus (Su): The patron of glassmakers allows the Westcrown devil to turn walls to glass. At 1st level, as a fullround action that costs 1 favor point, the Westcrown devil can see the internal workings of a lock, trap, or similar device that he touches. He gains a +4 bonus on Disable Device checks to disable this device. At 4th level, he can use eye of Vadrus to see through a section of any door or wall he is adjacent to and touches, as though a section of that wall or door no larger than 5 square feet were transparent. This effect works only on walls or doors that are no thicker than 6 inches. This effect lasts 1 round per class level.

Crucisal's Guidance (Su): The patron of navigation guides the Westcrown devil while hindering any pursuit. At 3rd level, when in an urban environment, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as a swift action to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his base speed and a +4 insight bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks for 1 minute. Whenever the Westcrown devil spends favor to improve a skill check as part of a chase (GameMastery Guide 232) or pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142), he adds 2d6 to his check instead of 1d6.

Adel's Craftsmanship (Sp): The patron of woodcraft imparts mastery over such creations. At 5th level, as a standard action, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use warp wood or meld into wood (as per meld into stone, except that the wood can be of any size or dimensions). If the Westcrown devil is 8th level or higher, he can use this ability as passwall through wooden barriers or statue to assume the form of a statue made of wood (hardness 5) instead.

Rixana's Bounty (Sp): Calling upon the patron of the bounty of deep waters allows for safe navigation of underwater regions. At 7th level, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as an immediate action to grant the benefits of water breathing for 24 hours. When he activates this ability, he can affect other creatures he can touch by spending 1 additional favor point for each added creature.

Palmor's Recovery (Sp): The patron of renewal grants access to powerful healing. At 8th level, as a standard action, a Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use cure serious wounds or lesser restoration. He can spend 3 favor points in a 1-minute ritual to use break enchantment or restoration (requiring expensive material components as appropriate).

Dotara's Shroud (Su): Experienced Westcrown devils gain the favor of the patron of the dottari (city guard). At 9th level, the Westcrown devil gains a +5 insight bonus on all skill checks opposed by or targeting city guards, a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks from city guards, and a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects created by city guards. This ability is constant and applies only while the Westcrown devil has at least 1 favor point remaining.

Arodennama's Avatar (Su or Sp): Westcrown's greatest monument, the Arodennama, symbolizes the dead god of humanity, and the Westcrown devil can draw inspiration from this towering statue to invoke Aroden's authority or mastery of the blade. At 10th level, the Westcrown devil can use his favor ability to improve attack rolls with longswords as if they were skill checks. In addition, as a full-round action, the Westcrown devil can spend 2 favor points to issue a suggestion, or spend 5 favor points to issue a mass suggestion. These function as the spells of the same name except that they affect only humans.

Council's Secret: At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Westcrown devil gains a rogue talent, selected from those available to rogues. The Westcrown devil treats his character level as his rogue level for the purpose of determining the talents' effects. At 6th level, whenever the Westcrown devil would select a rogue talent, he can select an advanced talent instead.

Alternatively, the Westcrown devil can focus on occult studies instead. If he chooses this option, when he would gain a talent via this ability, his spellcasting ability in a psychic spellcasting class he has increases by 1 level instead. The Westcrown devil can gain a level of spellcasting in this way once, plus one additional time at 6th and 10th levels.

Sneak Attack (Ex): At 3rd level, a Westcrown devil gains sneak attack as per the rogue class feature. The extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and it increases to 2d6 at 6th level, and to 3d6 at 9th level.
