The following are features of this prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A souldrinker gains proficiency with the favored weapon of her daemonic patron.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At the indicated levels, a souldrinker gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an souldrinker, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.

Apocalyptic Vow (Ex): At 1st level, the souldrinker must select one of the Four Horsemen or a daemon harbinger to which she makes an apocalyptic vow. When a souldrinker dies, the entity to which she made her apocalyptic vow claims her soul. A character attempting to resurrect a slain souldrinker must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the souldrinker's character level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the souldrinker again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do. This vow also grants the souldrinker a +3 bonus on saving throws against death effects and negative energy, which stacks with other such bonuses.

Cacodaemon Familiar (Ex): At 1st level, the souldrinker gains a cacodaemon familiar, as if she had the Improved Familiar feat. If the souldrinker already has a familiar, the cacodaemon replaces that familiar by devouring the prior familiar (this does not penalize the souldrinker). The souldrinker counts as an evil outsider for the purpose of using soul gems created by a cacodaemon.

Obedience (Ex): In order to maintain her souldrinker abilities (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by this prestige class), a souldrinker must indulge the Horseman or harbinger she worships with a daily obedience. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the souldrinker uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to a demigod, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of souldrinker, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her daemonic patron. This choice determines which category of boons she earns as she gains levels, and once made, it cannot later be changed.

Enervation (Sp): At 2nd level, a souldrinker can cast enervation twice per day as a spell-like ability (CL = her character level). At 5th level, she can use this ability four times per day, and at 8th level, she can use it six times per day.

Soul Pool (Su): At 2nd level, a souldrinker can store stolen life energy to use thereafter to accomplish unnatural feats. Her soul pool starts at 0, and at any one time, it can contain a maximum number of soul points equal to her souldrinker level. Every time a souldrinker inflicts a negative level on a creature other than herself, she gains 1 soul point. A souldrinker can expend soul points for the following.

Create Item: A souldrinker can expend points from her soul pool to provide energy for the creation of magic items. Each point expended provides 500 gp worth of raw materials for the item.

Recover Spell Slot: As a full-round action, a souldrinker can expend a number of points from her soul pool equal to double the spell level of a cast spell or expended spell slot in order to regain that spell or slot as if it had not been used. Protect Soul: A souldrinker can spend soul points to avoid gaining a negative level, at a rate of 1 soul point per negative level negated.

Daemonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su): As a souldrinker gains levels, she gains boons from her patron as her body and soul become increasingly infused with daemonic energies. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the souldrinker's chosen patron and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each Horseman or harbinger grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the souldrinker gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the Horseman and harbinger descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a souldrinker boon grants a spell-like ability, her caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a souldrinker to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally. Lesser Oblivion (Su): At 4th level, a souldrinker's apocalyptic vow invests her with a specific ability, depending on which Horseman she made her vow to, as listed below:

Apollyon: Immunity to diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.
Charon: Immunity to aging effects and Constitution damage and drain.
Szuriel: Immunity to bleed effects and Strength damage and drain.
Trelmarixian: Immunity to ingested and inhaled poisons, and the souldrinker no longer needs to eat or drink.

Oblivion (Sp): At 7th level, the souldrinker is granted more power by her apocalyptic vow, gaining a spell-like ability usable at will but that costs 1 soul point for each use.

Apollyon: contagion
Charon: vampiric touch
Szuriel: rage
Trelmarixian: bestow curse

Greater Oblivion (Sp): At 10th level, the souldrinker gains more power from her apocalyptic vow. The spell-like abilities listed here are usable at will but cost 3 soul points per use. Apollyon: plague storm
Charon: wither limb
Szuriel: blade barrier
Trelmarixian: quickened feast of ashes
