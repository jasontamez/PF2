All followers of the Green Faith appreciate and respect nature, but for a Green Faith acolyte this admiration blossoms into a profound reverence for the power and infinite majesty of the natural world in all its aspects, both brutal and tender.

Green Faith acolytes seek balance, and hold that no single power can be too great for long. All things must ebb and f low, and nothing is exempt from the endless cycle of life, death, decay, and rebirth.

Adherents of the Green Faith follow a strict hierarchy that ref lects their philosophy of ecological equilibrium. The top leadership comprises only a strict few individuals, their positions secured through a system of challenges made by lesser-ranked initiates against higher-ups in the same way a potential rival must challenge the alpha of an animal pack. The form a particular challenge takes depends on the terms the challenger and her opponent agree upon. Some are fierce battles to the death, and others melee duels or contests of spellcasting. Nonviolent challenges could be tests of biological knowledge, competitive hunts, racing events, or even challenges involving nurturing a rare plant or endangered animal.

Members of the Green Faith fiercely oppose the unnatural, including living or undead abominations that have no place in the natural order. Renowned for their impartiality, Green Faith acolytes commonly serve as judges, ambassadors, or mediators between opposing parties.

The following are class features of the Green Faith acolyte prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Green Faith acolyte gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.

Companion Bond (Ex): At the indicated levels, a Green Faith acolyte increases her effective druid level by 1 for determining the abilities of her animal companion. If she has no animal companion, she instead gains a druid animal companion, treating her effective druid level as 1/2 her class level (minimum 1).

Wild Empathy (Ex): This ability is identical to the druid class ability. For the purpose of this ability, a Green Faith acolyte's class level stacks with levels in any other class that grants the wild empathy ability.

Wild Link (Su): At the indicated levels, a Green Faith acolyte increases her effective druid level by 1 for determining the powers and uses per day of her wild shape ability. If a Green Faith acolyte doesn't have the wild shape class ability, she instead gains the wild shape ability of a 4th-level druid when she has a wild link bonus of +4, increasing her effective druid level by 1 for each iteration of this ability beyond +4.

Hibernate (Su): At 3rd level, a Green Faith acolyte can enter a state of suspended animation as a full-round action. This state is similar to the effect of sepia snake sigil, except that the Green Faith acolyte is aware of changes in her surroundings or harm to her body as if deeply asleep. She can end this state at any time as a full-round action. If she remains in hibernation for at least a week before emerging, her body is renewed as if by both a heal spell and a restoration spell. A Green Faith acolyte can remain in this state for up to 1 week per class level, after which she must wait 1 day for each week spent hibernating before entering hibernation again.

Power over Nature (Su): At 4th level, when a Green Faith acolyte's divine spell deals hit point damage to or heals hit point damage for a creature of the animal, fey, or plant type, it deals or heals additional hit point damage equal to the spell's level.

Animal Covenant (Su): At 5th level, when casting a divine spell with an area affect, a Green Faith acolyte can choose a number of animals within the spell's area equal to her Wisdom or Charisma modifier, whichever is higher (minimum 1). These animals are excluded from the spell's effects. If the spell has a duration longer than instantaneous, the animals are protected against the spell for only a number of rounds equal to the Green Faith acolyte's class level.

Venom Immunity (Ex): At 6th level, a Green Faith acolyte gains immunity to all poisons.

Blighter of Abominations (Su): At 7th level, when a divine spell cast by the Green Faith acolyte affects a creature of the aberration type, she treats the spell as if it had been modified by the Sickening Spell metamagic feat. When a divine spell cast by the Green Faith acolyte harms an undead creature, she treats the spell as if it had been modified by the Empower Spell metamagic feat. The spell affects other creature types normally. This ability doesn't increase the spell's casting time or spell level.

Archdruid: At 8th level, a Green Faith acolyte can become an Archdruid if there's a vacancy in her region, or if she seeks out and bests an existing Archdruid in hand-tohand combat, a competition of spells, or some other formal contest. If, after gaining the title, she loses a similar challenge from a rival, she loses the title of Archdruid. She also gives up the title of Archdruid upon becoming a Great Druid. A Green Faith acolyte must attain the title of Archdruid before she can progress to 9th level.

Great Druid: At 9th level, a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Great Druid in a manner similar to the way a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Archdruid. She gives up the title of Great Druid upon becoming a Grand Druid. A Green Faith acolyte must attain the title of Great Druid before she can progress to 10th level.

Grand Druid (Su): At 10th level, a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Grand Druid in a manner similar to the way a Green Faith acolyte can gain or lose the title of Archdruid. Each day, the Grand Druid can prepare a total of 10 additional spell levels of divine spells, or cast up to 10 additional levels of divine spells if she is a spontaneous spellcaster, chosen from spell levels she is already capable of casting. She loses this ability if she loses the title of Grand Druid.

Longevity (Ex): At 10th level, a Green Faith acolyte's maximum age increases by 20%.

Timeless Body (Ex): At 10th level, a Green Faith acolyte no longer takes penalties for aging. This functions exactly like the druid ability of the same name.
