These are the class features of the brewkeeper prestige class.

Spells per Day: A brewkeeper who has alchemist levels can choose alchemist as the class to enhance with this ability, increasing her alchemist extracts per day.

Distilled Spells (Su): A brewkeeper can spend 1 minute distilling an extract or spell she has prepared or an unused spell slot into a draught. When she does so with an alchemist extract, the draught functions as if enhanced by the infusion discovery. Spells can be distilled only if they qualify to be created as a potion or oil from the spell but without the limitation of being a 3rd- or lower-level spell. Once a draught is created, it persists for up to 24 hours, even if it is no longer in the brewkeeper's possession. After this point, the draught becomes inert and the brewkeeper regains the use of that extract or spell slot (although she must still prepare that slot normally, as if she had cast the spell or used the extract from that slot during the day). As long as the draught remains potent, it continues to occupy one of the brewkeeper's daily extract or spell slots. A draught functions as a potion or oil, and can be used by any creature.

Faithful Drinker (Ex): When a brewkeeper drinks a potion, elixir, mutagen, draught, or other magical beverage, the brewkeeper gains a +2 sacred bonus on Will saves for 1 round.

Brew Reservoir (Su): At 2nd level, a brewkeeper gains a reservoir of brew points that she can use to apply helpful or harmful homebrews to her draughts, extracts, and spells. A brewkeeper can add only one such effect to a single draught, extract, or spell at a time. The number of points in a brew reservoir is equal to 3 + her brewkeeper level. The brew reservoir is replenished whenever the brewkeeper prepares her spells or extracts.

Helpful Homebrew (Su): At 2nd level and every 2 class levels thereafter, a brewkeeper can select one metamagic feat from the list in the following paragraph. She can spend points from her brew reservoir as a swift action to add a metamagic effect to a spell as she casts it, an extract as she drinks it, or a draught as she creates it. She does not need to meet the feat's prerequisites in order to select the effect. Using this ability costs a number of brew points equal to the metamagic feat's level increase (minimum 1).

The metamagic effects available (and the brewkeeper level at which she can select them) are: Empower Spell (4th), Extend Spell (2nd), Fleeting Spell (4th), Maximize Spell (6th), Silent Spell (4th), and Tenacious Spell (2nd).

Harmful Homebrew (Su): At 3rd level, a brewkeeper can enhance her attacks with a harmful homebrew. Whenever she hits a creature with a splash weapon or a touch spell, she can spend 1 brew point as a swift action to add an effect to the spell or splash weapon. These additional effects caused by a harmful homebrew apply regardless of whether or not the target succeeds at any saving throws associated with the touch spell or splash weapon's normal affects. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to avoid the effect of the harmful homebrew (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brewkeeper's caster level + the brewkeeper's highest mental ability score modifier). On a successful save, the target becomes sickened for 1 round (as if suffering, temporarily, the effects of intoxication), but on a failed save, the target is aff licted with the harmful homebrew's effect, as chosen by the brewkeeper from the options below. Conditions inf licted by hindering homebrews don't stack.

At 3rd level, the brewkeeper can select one of the following effects when she successfully affects a creature with a harmful homebrew. Every 3 class levels thereafter, the brewkeeper can apply an additional harmful homebrew effect to her touch spell or splash weapon, for a total of three effects at 9th level.

Entangled: The target becomes entangled in its gear until it spends a full-round action adjusting itself.

Fatigued: The target is fatigued for 1 round.

Prone: The target falls prone.

At 6th level, the brewkeeper adds the following harmful homebrews to the list of those she can select.

Confused: The target is confused for 1 round.

Dazed: The target is dazed for 1 round.

Staggered: The target is staggered for 1 round.

At 9th level, the brewkeeper adds the following homebrews to the list of those she can select. Exhausted: The target is exhausted for 1 round, and then fatigued for 1 round after that. The brewkeeper must have applied the fatigued condition to the harmful homebrew before selecting this effect.

Nauseated: The target is nauseated for 1 round.

Potion Master (Ex): At 3rd level, a brewkeeper can, as a move action, add a chaser of alcohol when she drinks a potion or administers a potion to a willing creature. If she does so, she uses her own caster level instead of the potion's caster level when determining the effects of the potion. She can also apply the effects of a helpful homebrew to a potion at this time as if it were a draught she had created.

Brew Specialization (Su): At 5th level, a brewkeeper can apply the effects of two helpful homebrews or harmful homebrews instead of one when she takes a swift action to apply a homebrew's effect. She must still pay the full brew point cost for the homebrews she applies.

Quick Brewing (Su): At 7th level, a brewkeeper can create a draught as a full-round action.

True Brewkeeper (Su): At 10th level, a brewkeeper can create a draught as part of a spell's normal casting time or as part of the action to draw an extract, effectively allowing her to spontaneously create draughts. In addition, she can apply up to three homebrew effects at once. When the brewkeeper uses her faithful drinker ability, the sacred bonus granted applies to all saving throws for 1 round.
