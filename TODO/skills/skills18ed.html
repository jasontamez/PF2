With sufficient ranks in Appraise, you earn the following.

5 Ranks: A successful DC 20 Appraise check reveals whether an item is magical, and a second check (DC = 25 + the item's caster level) unveils its properties. You can use Appraise to detect non-written forgeries and counterfeits.

10 Ranks: You can determine the most expensive object a creature is wearing or wielding (or in a 5-foot cube) as a standard action by succeeding at a DC 20 check. You never make a wildly inaccurate appraisal of an item's value.

15 Ranks: Determining the most expensive object as above is a move action. You can substitute an Appraise check at a -10 penalty for a Will save to disbelieve a figment or glamer.

20 Ranks: Determining the most expensive object as above is a move action, and if the check succeeds, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks to steal that object or disarm a creature of that object for 1 minute.
