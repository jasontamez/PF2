Description

This small bright-blue flower has five petals arrayed in a star shape and looks remarkably similar to several other species of blue flowers that live in similar regions, requiring a successful DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check to correctly identify. The poison causes severe liver damage, making it even more difficult to resist future poisons that a victim may encounter. Although rarely a direct danger to humanoids, the flowers are sometimes consumed by livestock. When this occurs, the venom can be passed on through milk the animals produce for the next week, affecting those who drink it as though they had consumed a dose of blue star.
