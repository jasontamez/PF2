Description

A blackish pollen produced by the night witch (a pale, vine-growing flower that blooms in the light of the moon and is hearty enough to survive very rugged and difficult environments), crone's curse disorients those who inhale it and interferes with the body's ability to regulate temperature. Merely walking through a field of night witch flowers is often sufficient enough to kick up a cloud of the nearly invisible black particles, which are a mere nuisance in temperate climates but can prove fatal to those exposed to them in deserts and tundra.
