Description

This mostly benign, malodorous mold induces temporary illness with no lasting effect, and it can be detected in food or drink with a DC 15 Perception check, unless the food is particularly pungent, in which case the Perception DC increases by up to 5. Named for students wishing to convincingly feign illness, anyone can easily cultivate this mold in dark, moist spaces.
