Description

This red fern has jagged, forward-pointing leaves and grows in small, close-packed groups. It is named for its popularity among witch hunters and inquisitors, and its leaves can be brewed into a tea that clouds the subject's mind, interfering with the ability to cast spells while still leaving the subject lucid enough to be interrogated. The tea has a unique taste, which can be detected with a successful DC 20 Perception check. Attempts to disguise the taste require a Profession (cook) check (or a Wisdom check, for untrained characters) opposed by the drinker's Perception check. At the GM's discretion, bonuses can be applied based on the ingredients used to mask the taste.
