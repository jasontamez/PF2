Description

This poison is produced in the liver of a particular species of water-dwelling lizard and produces potent hallucinations. In some places, the lizards are raised as livestock specifically for the harvesting of the poison, which is then used for ritual ceremonies and recreational purposes. People in some cultures voluntarily dose themselves with this poison as a way to gain oracular insights into the world, but more often than not the revelations are nothing but subtle nightmares and lack true insight.
