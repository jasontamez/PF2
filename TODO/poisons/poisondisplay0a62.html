Description

This poison is culled from specially bred thornapples, and is often administered on the skin of an apple itself. It is typically employed to fake the deaths of dissidents so their disappearances don't attract attention. Creatures in the deathlike trance this poison causes are unconscious and can't be woken by mundane means; a successful DC 25 Heal check is required to realize the victim is alive. The victim can be shaken from this trance with any magical healing (including lesser restoration, as appropriate).
