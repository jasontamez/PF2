Description

This poisonous paste, made from dried cockatrice organs, causes extreme muscle stiffness and joint pain, with an unpleasant feeling of gravel grinding in the victim's shoulders, hips, and knees. As long as a creature has any Dexterity damage from this poison, the creature finds it physically painful to make wide motions with its limbs. Whenever the creature attacks with a two-handed weapon or moves more than 10 feet in a round (other than via travel that doesn't require movement, such as by wagon, or teleportation), it takes 2d6 points of damage.
