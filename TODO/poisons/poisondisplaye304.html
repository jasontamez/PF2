Description

The wise alchemist takes careful precautions whenever handling hydrofluoric acid. This corrosive substance-an occasional byproduct of volcanic gases that is used for industrial purposes-dissolves bones and causes tissue damage when even a small amount contacts the skin. The acid dissolves the body of any victim who dies from hydrofluoric acid poisoning unless the acid is neutralized within 1 minute with a successful DC 20 Heal or Craft (alchemy) check. Hydrofluoric acid must be stored in a magically reinforced container, as it dissolves mundane glass and corrodes metal over time.
