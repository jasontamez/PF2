Boons

1: Domination (Ex) Select a creature type from the ranger favored enemies table. You treat that creature type as your favored enemy, as per the ranger ability. If you choose humanoid (human), you can select one of the following ethnicities Kellid, Mwangi, Shoanti, or Ulfen (or another clannish or tribal ethnicity, at the GM's discretion). If you choose an ethnicity, the bonuses on skill checks, weapon attack, and weapon damage rolls increase to +4, but you do not gain any bonuses against other humans. These bonuses stack with any favored enemy bonuses gained from other classes.
2: Identification (Su) Three times per day as a swift action, you can choose a living creature within sight and know its creature type, ethnicity (if any), and alignment. Additionally, for a number of hours equal to your character level, that creature is treated as though you had cast the spell status upon it. Though unaware of your probing, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this ability (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Spells such as undetectable alignment may prevent a portion of this information from being gleaned, while spells such as nondetection stymie this effect entirely. This is a divination effect.
3: End Superstition (Sp) Once per day, you can cast mage's disjunction, using your character level as your caster level.Order of the Nail Hellknights idealize the civilized society of southern Avistan and seek to unite all people in advancing that cultural baseline. In fact, the Order of the Nail's members preach that anyone who doesn't embrace Chelish culture is a criminal and heathen who must be destroyed. The order's members idealize the lifestyles and challenges of frontier settlers, no matter the displacement, indignation, or cruelty they might visit on those who were there before.
