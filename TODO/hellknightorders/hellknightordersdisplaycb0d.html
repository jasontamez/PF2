Boons

(From analagous order)
1: Mute (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, you can target a single creature within 100 feet. If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), the creature cannot make any sounds for a number of rounds equal to your character level. This prevents the target from speaking, otherwise making noise, casting spells with verbal components, and using similar abilities with auditory effects. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This effect is dismissable. It does not make the target immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, or effects.
2: Dismantle (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can cause a cloud of thick, brown fog to arise from a chosen point within 200 feet. This cloud functions as per fog cloud, using your character level as your caster level, except the fog spreads in a 10-foot radius, and every creature or object within is affected as per rusting grasp, without any touch attacks required. Attended metal objects, including weapons and armor, receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate this effect using their wielder's Fortitude saving throw bonus (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Creatures within the cloud are affected by the rusting effect only once, not every round, but creatures that move back into the area are exposed again. You and your possessions can enter the cloud and not be affected. This effect is dismissable.
3: Ruin (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can use greater shout as a spell-like ability (DC = 18 + your Charisma modifier).During the Chelish civil war, border troops were withdrawn to defend the warring heartlands. Rather than let the southern edge of Cheliax fall to Rahadoumi, 300 Hellknights of the Chain took over the posts and held the border for 30 years. At the civil wars conclusion, a number of the Hellknights stayed on to protect the border, and now the Order of the Wall is charged with defending the boundaries of civilization.
