Boons

1: Spill Guilty Blood (Sp) The end of a lawbreaker invigorates you like nothing else. Twice per day, you can cast death knell as a spell-like ability, using your character level as your caster level (DC = 12 + your Charisma modifier). If you do not have a caster level, instead of a +1 increase in effective caster level, this ability provides you a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls for 10 minutes per Hit Die of the target. If you have a caster level, you can choose to gain this bonus on attack and damage rolls instead of to your effective caster level.
2: Terrible Justice (Sp) You end a foe's life with a brutal display of force. Three times per day, when you perform a coup de grace, all foes within 30 feet must succeed at a Will saving throw or be affected as per the spell fear (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier).
3: Reason to Fear (Su) You fear nothing, as you know you are a source of nightmares. You are immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Three times per day, when you are the target of a fear effect or within a fear effect's area, you can target the creature from which the fear effect originated with a phantasmal killer spell effect (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier) as a free action when you strike it with a weapon. You must deal at least 1 point of damage to use this ability. This functions in all other ways as if your weapon were a spell storing weapon with a phantasmal killer spell stored within.Hellknights of the Scourge seek out corruption within order and laws not fit for the lawful. They question and seek to determine the difference between what is legal and what is for the greater good-owing allegiance to no one nation or ruler. Their quests for order often take them places that other Hellknights cannot tread, both physically and philosophically. As a result, their commitment to the Measure and the Chain must be beyond reproach.
