Tenants <ul><li>I will seek the chaos that manifests in common words and thoughts.</li> <li>Those who lack direction will find guidance by my hand-whether the palm or the fist.</li> <li>I will take the tools from the grasp of those who would craft their own dooms, whether they would do so intentionally or unintentionally.</li> <li>Though the flag of no nation has my alliance, every rebel is my foe.</li> <li>My discipline is the same as my honor. I will make myself worthy of our brethren's tradition of greatness.</li> <li>My mere presence will represent the pinnacle of orderliness. I will save my words and deeds for when they are needed most.</li> <li>I will not allow the shedding of tears to rust the wheels of progress.</li></ul>

Boons

1: Mute (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, you can target a single creature within 100 feet. If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), the creature cannot make any sounds for a number of rounds equal to your character level. This prevents the target from speaking, otherwise making noise, casting spells with verbal components, and using similar abilities with auditory effects. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This effect is dismissable. It does not make the target immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, or effects.
2: Dismantle (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can cause a cloud of thick, brown fog to arise from a chosen point within 200 feet. This cloud functions as per fog cloud, using your character level as your caster level, except the fog spreads in a 10-foot radius, and every creature or object within is affected as per rusting grasp, without any touch attacks required. Attended metal objects, including weapons and armor, receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate this effect using their wielder's Fortitude saving throw bonus (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Creatures within the cloud are affected by the rusting effect only once, not every round, but creatures that move back into the area are exposed again. You and your possessions can enter the cloud and not be affected. This effect is dismissable.
3: Ruin (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can use greater shout as a spell-like ability (DC = 18 + your Charisma modifier).Order of the Rack Hellknights hate wastefulness of both thought and deed. They crush pointless dreams, end rebellions, and trample frivolous or dangerous inventions. They also closely observe individuals, seeking hints of destructive ambitions and wasteful vices, and are skilled at destroying seditious writing and strange inventions.
