Effect Strange animal noises pervade the underbrush within the area of the echo, and strange tracks can be easily discovered. Non-fey viewing the tracks are fascinated by them and are compelled to follow (DC 16 Will negates). Each creature that fails this save follows a different set of tracks only it can perceive, moving in a random direction for up to 1 minute at a speed of 20 feet per round. This effect continues even if the creature leaves the echo's area. At the end of each of its turns following the tracks, a creature can attempt a new Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it fails three such saving throws, the creature must follow the tracks for the remaining duration. <a href="spelldisplayf177.html?ItemName=Break%20enchantment">Break enchantment</a> or a similar effect cast on an affected creature removes this compulsion. This is a mind-affecting effect.
Benefit Creatures viewing the tracks and compelled by the echo are not allowed subsequent saves, and must follow the tracks for 1 hour instead of 1 minute, unless the compulsion on the creature is removed by <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> or a similar effect.
Destruction A character who succeeds at her initial saving throw against the compulsion can attempt to deal damage against the echo by disrupting the original tracks. This requires the use of Survival as a full-round action. With a successful DC 24 Survival check, such a character deals 1d6 points of damage to the echo. If the result of the Survival check used in this way is a natural 20, she deals 2d6 points of damage to the echo instead. Casting <a href="spelldisplayb825.html?ItemName=find%20the%20path">find the path</a> and touching the tracks (treating it as a creature for this use) destroys the haunt instantly.
