Description

The regret of those who arrived too late to spare others a terrible fate can manifest as a haunt. A belated arrival haunt often arises near another haunt or undead, representing the fate that these regretful spirits were not fast enough to stop. A belated arrival haunt is often chained to a <a href="monsterdisplaya37e.html?ItemName=Ghost">ghost</a> but a <a href="monsterdisplay8741.html?ItemName=Necrocraft">necrocraft</a> is a truly horrifying alternative.
