Effect The area fills with a potent miasma that reeks of decaying flesh. Everyone within the radius must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or contract the disease living rot, as detailed below, except they bypass the latent/carrier state. Within the haunt's area, the disease's frequency increases to 1 round and its save DC increases to 20. Characters who succeed at this saving throw are not immune; they must attempt a new saving throw each round they remain in the haunt's area. Reducing the haunt to 0 hit points does not remove the disease. A character who casts <a href="spelldisplay96a6.html?ItemName=remove%20disease">remove disease</a> on the living decay haunt deals it an amount of damage equal to her caster level.
Destruction Casting <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> on each remaining body in the original victims' mass grave (or a single casting of <a href="spelldisplay9598.html?ItemName=mass%20heal">mass heal</a>) prevents this haunt from returning.


Description

Among the most frightening diseases are those that cause their victims' bodies to rot away. A living decay haunt arises when an epidemic of such a disease devastates a population. This haunt uses the optional disease rules presented on pages 138-139 of Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained.


Living Rot

Type disease, contact, inhaled, or injury; Save Fortitude DC 17
Track physical; Frequency 1/day

In the impaired state, the target takes a 50% miss chance on attack rolls and the target's speed is reduced by half (minimum 5 feet). All objects touched at the impaired state and beyond can transfer the disease; Cure 2 consecutive saves, penalties from the weakened state and worse are permanent until the victim is the target of <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> or <a href="spelldisplayb175.html?ItemName=regenerate">regenerate</a>
