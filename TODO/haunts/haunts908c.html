CR 7; XP 3,200
CE persistent haunt (30-ft. radius)
Caster Level 7th
Notice Perception or Sense Motive DC 20 (to see the outllines of a dozen cloaked figures begin to form or feel a suden sense of suspicion)
hp 31; Trigger proximity; Reset 1 day
Effect As dozens of cloaked figures swarm the area, the line between friend and foe blurs, and paranoia descends upon everyone within the haunt's area, as per <a href="spelldisplayee40.html?ItemName=confusion">confusion</a> (Will DC 15 negates). Furthermore, creatures within the haunt's area must attempt a DC 15 Will saving throw against the haunt's curse. Until it is removed, the curse forces its victims to attempt saving throws against spells, including those designated harmless. Additionally, the victims cannot benefit from any effect that requires them to treat another creature as an ally, such as flanking or aid another. <a href="spelldisplay06a1.html?ItemName=Remove%20curse">Remove curse</a> can remove this effect.
Destruction The betrayal haunt is destroyed if a victim falls unconscious or dies because of damage it took on behalf of another creature in the area. Any spell or ability that allows for the transfer of damage, such as <a href="spelldisplay2215.html?ItemName=shield%20other">shield other</a> or a <a href="mysterydisplay195c.html?ItemName=Life">life oracle's lifelink ability</a>, satisfies this haunt's requirement. This doesn't work if the characters in question colluded to manufacture the damage transfer to destroy the haunt; it works only if it was a truly selfless act of protecting another.


Description

When the sting of betrayal lingers beyond the grave, it can manifest as a disjointed mass of confused and paranoid spiritual energy that can turn even the closest of allies against one another.
