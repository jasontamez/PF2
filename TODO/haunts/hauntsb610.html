Effect As soon as a Small or larger creature enters the area of a dimensional tear, it is affected as if by <a href="spelldisplaydf57.html?ItemName=plane%20shift">plane shift</a> and must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or be immediately transported to the First World. When this occurs, a creature from the First World (determined randomly from the <a href="spelldisplayc057.html?ItemName=summon%20nature%e2%80%99s%20ally%206">summon nature's ally VI</a> list) is teleported to a space adjacent to the echo, determined by the GM. The creature has a starting attitude of hostile.
Benefit Determine the First World creature called using the <a href="spelldisplayfdf6.html?ItemName=summon%20nature%e2%80%99s%20ally%207">summon nature's ally VII</a> list instead, and then add the <a href="monsterdisplay27d4.html?ItemName=Fey%20Giant%20Toad">fey creature template</a>.
Destruction A character with <a href="spelldisplaydf57.html?ItemName=plane%20shift">plane shift</a> prepared can attempt to counterspell the echo's effect. Successfully doing so destroys the dimensional tear.
