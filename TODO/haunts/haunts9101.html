Effect This haunt seeks to influence the actions of the living, targeting a victim with a <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> effect or a heightened <a href="spelldisplaye5f6.html?ItemName=command">command</a> (save DC 14 for either). Depending on the haunt's alignment and goals, the suggested actions may be malicious (such as subtly putting its victims in harm's way or sowing antagonistic interactions) or benign (such as prompting mysterious automatic writings or unconscious utterances in hopes of communicating its ambitions to the world of the living).
Destruction A demanding dead typically asks for rest for its mortal remains or the resolution of desires unfulfilled in life. Fulfilling the request dismisses the haunt.


Description

Some haunts influence the thoughts and actions of those in the mortal realms to communicate their anger, desires, or goals, which can lead to instances of direct-voice channeling and automatic writing. While the demanding dead are sometimes malevolent, more often there is a method to their requests, which could potentially reveal shocking secrets or the key to putting them to rest forever.
