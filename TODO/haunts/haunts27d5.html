Effect This dungeon directs its malevolence toward everyone inside of it. Its interior is under the effects of <a href="spelldisplaye025.html?ItemName=guards%20and%20wards">guards and wards</a> at all times. If this ability is dispelled, the haunt recreates it when it resets the following day. Once per minute, the dungeon can gather a collection of furniture and other items to form an <a href="monsterdisplayff66.html?ItemName=Animated%20Object">animated object</a>. It can create one Colossal animated object; alternatively, it can create two Gargantuan animated objects, four Huge animated objects, and so on. It can control up to four times as many animated objects as it can create in a minute (for a total CR of 15). For the purposes of detecting creatures, the haunted dungeon and its animated objects have blindsight out to a range of the entire area of the haunt, even through walls.
Destruction If the entire dungeon is simultaneously placed under the effects of <a href="spelldisplaye3ec.html?ItemName=hallow">hallow</a>, the haunt is destroyed.


Description

When enough haunts gather in a single dungeon, they can combine into a gestalt haunt that infuses the entire structure with a single, malevolent will. The haunt's source typically rests in the most difficult to find or obscure location within the structure, but it moves if it senses creatures approaching it.
