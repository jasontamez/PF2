Effect This haunt subtly possesses a living host as <a href="spelldisplay18c3.html?ItemName=possession">possession</a> (Will DC 20 negates) in order to sow fear and injury in the wider world. When it first possesses a host creature, the insidious presence may offer enticing boons for several months using its <a href="spelldisplaycd99.html?ItemName=shadow%20conjuration">shadow conjuration</a> effect (such as summoning allies to assist the host). But soon, the haunt's inner malignancy takes over as it uses its <a href="spelldisplaycd99.html?ItemName=shadow%20conjuration">shadow conjuration</a> (DC 18 where applicable) to produce harmful or even deadly effects against its host.

An insidious presence that has slain a number of different hosts equal to its CR undergoes a startling transformation. This powerful entity has CR of 12, learns to utilize <a href="spelldisplaye7a2.html?ItemName=%20shadow%20conjuration">greater shadow conjuration</a> (DC 22 where applicable), has a caster level of 14, has a radius of 60 feet when not possessing a creature, and has 54 hit points.
Destruction An insidious presence can be destroyed only if an innocent creature willingly accepts it into its body and then intentionally sacrifices its life to destroy the haunt forever.


Description

This haunt hides within a host's body, at first offering tempting boons to make the host comfortable with their presence before ultimately seeking the host's destruction.
