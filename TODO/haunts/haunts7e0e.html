Effect This free-roaming haunt wanders the vacant halls of old manors and dank dungeons. When the haunt is triggered, the skeletal remains of spectral rats burst forth from every crack and crevice of the room, scurrying over the area and voraciously consuming trespassers, as the <a href="spelldisplaye7fb.html?ItemName=summon%20swarm">summon swarm</a> spell.
Destruction A character must ritually kill a common cat in the area. The cat's ghost manifests and consumes the ectoplasmic swarm over the course of 1 week, earning both the cat and the rats permanent rest.


Description

Overwhelming, unresolved guilt-or horrific death by thousands of tiny teeth-can lead to the manifestation of ghostly vermin swarms. The haunted area often displays signs of ancient rodent infestation.
