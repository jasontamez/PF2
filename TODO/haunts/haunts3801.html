Effect The chemical vat boils and froths, and spits its contents at everyone within its range each round as a ranged touch attack (+15 to hit, 4d6+6 points of damage). This damage ignores damage reduction and energy resistance. A creature hit by the chemicals must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become liquefied, as its bones and muscles melt into a pile of oozing flesh. The DC of this saving throw increases by 1 for each chemical ball that has hit the creature in the past 24 hours. A liquefied creature cannot carry, use, or wear any items, and its Dexterity score is reduced to 1. It loses all physical attacks, and it cannot cast spells with verbal or somatic components. It gains a slam attack appropriate for a creature of one size category larger than its size (for example, 1d6 points of damage if Medium). Additionally, it gains immunity to critical hits, flanking, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stun. A liquefied creature reverts to its normal state if the haunt is reduced to 0 hit points; otherwise, only a <a href="spelldisplay6497.html?ItemName=limited%20wish">limited wish</a>, <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a>, <a href="spelldisplayb175.html?ItemName=regenerate">regenerate</a>, or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell can restore it.
Destruction All of the alchemist's research notes must be collected and thrown into the vat.


Description

A sadistic alchemist conducted experiments on test subjects within his remote laboratory. When he was finished with his subjects, he threw them into a vat of harsh chemicals to dissolve. His victims' spirits have permeated the vat, and they reach out with their oozing spectral forms toward any who come near.
