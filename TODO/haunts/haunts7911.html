NE haunt (5-ft. radius)
Caster Level 1st
Notice Perception DC 20 (to feel the temperature dropping)

Effect The temperature suddenly plummets below freezing. All creatures within the radius are affected as if they had been outside in cold weather for 1 hour, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage unless they succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save. The cold temperature lingers for 10 minutes, but has no additional mechanical effect.
Destruction If the cold spot is destroyed with holy fire (such as with <a href="spelldisplay58a3.html?ItemName=flame%20strike">flame strike</a>), it never returns.


Description

Cold spots are echoes of spirits too weak to manifest as ghosts. They can occur alone or cluster around significant areas.
