Effect Remnants of Lamashtu's power awaken bestial ferocity within those who walk upon this unholy ground. All creatures must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or experience the effects of the <a href="spelldisplay295e.html?ItemName=moonstruck">moonstruck</a> spell. Additionally, worshipers of Desna who fail the saving throw take 2d6 points of slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage each round for the next 5 rounds as deep gashes and bite marks appear all over their bodies. These bites do not count as an attacker for the purposes of determining a Desnan's actions. Creatures that worship Lamashtu gain the bite and claw attacks that <a href="spelldisplay295e.html?ItemName=moonstruck">moonstruck</a> grants for 24 hours without any ill effects. If they already have claws or a bite attack, these attacks deal damage as if they were two size categories larger.
Destruction If a cleric of Desna with the Travel domain casts <a href="spelldisplayb825.html?ItemName=find%20the%20path">find the path</a> on the resonance, it is permanently destroyed. When the spell is cast in this way, it has no other effect.


Description

Long ago, the god Curchanus was the patron of beasts and travel. The demon lord Lamashtu envied Curchanus's power and seized an opportunity to lead Curchanus into a trap. With the god in her clutches, Lamashtu wrenched away his dominion over beasts and claimed it for herself by murdering Curchanus. Although Lamashtu was unable to stop Curchanus from granting his dominion over travel to his friend Desna, she siphoned enough power from the god to fuel her own ascent into divinity over his withered husk.

Miraculous Resonances

When deities interact with the world directly, their influence can persist in the form of miraculous resonances. These regions often become pilgrimage sites for the deity's worshipers.

The resonances sense the presence of their creator's influence and react differently to their creator's followers than to all others they encounter. Typically, they grant the faithful a benefit for 24 hours, though a single pilgrim can receive a manifestation's blessing only once. A miraculous resonance haunt has an alignment identical to the deity with which it resonates. These resonances typically manifest in areas where the associated deity's worship has traditionally been strong, but they can appear anywhere where such worship is particularly potent or where the deity has brushed against the Material Plane at some point in the past.

Miraculous resonances are vulnerable to forces connected to other deities, as well as spells that oppose their deity's nature. Spells with an alignment descriptor that does not match the haunt's alignment deal 1d6 points of damage per spell level (or the spell's damage against an aligned outsider, whichever is higher). While weapon attacks cannot normally harm miraculous resonances, these haunts take any extra damage that specifically affects creatures of their alignment, such as the 2d6 points of extra damage from a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay86e5.html?ItemName=Holy">holy</a> weapon or the extra damage from a paladin's smite evil. Such attacks target an AC of 5. Channeled energy can damage a resonance, so long as the creature channeling the energy has a patron deity of a different alignment than the haunt.
