Description

An eternal pyre is formed from the spirits of people who were burned alive during an overzealous witch trial. It hates all living beings, but it has a strong bond of kinship with the <a href="monsterdisplay5925.html?ItemName=Witchfire">witchfire</a> who arose from the most powerful of those spirits. The <a href="monsterdisplay5925.html?ItemName=Witchfire">witchfire</a> often lurks within the haunt's area, as her witchflame intensifies the power of the pyre's strikes, which in turn heal her.
