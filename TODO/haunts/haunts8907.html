Effect Whenever the wielder of the haunted weapon threatens a critical hit with the weapon, the area immediately resonates with a cacophonous cackling. All creatures within a 35-foot radius centered on the weapon suffer the effects of a <a href="spelldisplay6344.html?ItemName=song%20of%20discord">song of discord</a> spell (Will DC 17 negates) for the next 8 rounds. If the weapon's wielder is affected, she gains a +2 bonus on the critical confirmation roll.
Destruction The weapon must be boiled in the cauldron of a willing hag's coven, which destroys both the weapon and the cauldron at the same time.


Description

Sometimes a weapon that slays a powerful witch or hag becomes tainted by the victim's malignant hatred. Although haunted weapons often still bear holy marks from the original owners or relics like bones from a revered saint, these are never sufficient to contain the malevolence that dwells within the weapon.
