Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The caster lights the rare incense and then scribes a complex conjuring diagram on the floor using glowing inks, then must focus on the runes to look through reality into the Abyss while reciting the methods by which a <a href="monsterdisplay3276.html?ItemName=Retriever">retriever</a> can be shaped into being from raw Abyssal quintessence. If the ritual is successful, a retriever is conjured at the caster's location. The retriever is loyal to the caster but will perform only one service before it vanishes back to the Abyss. If the service takes longer to perform than a number of years equal to the primary caster's level, the retriever vanishes at the end of this duration, even if its service is not yet complete.
