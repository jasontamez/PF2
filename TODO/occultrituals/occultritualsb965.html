Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The caster uses the ouroboros blood to paint complex mathematical equations on the ground surrounding a dead body (or if lacking a body, in the area where the body was slain). Upon the ritual's completion, the dead body is restored to life, as per <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a>. Unlike that spell's limitation, there is no limit as to how long the body has been dead before it can be restored to life in this manner, but bodies whose souls have been judged and sent on to the afterlife (GM's discretion) cannot be restored to life via this ritual. A creature can be restored to life via an ouroboros blood ritual only once through all time.
