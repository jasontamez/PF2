Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

This ritual can be cast only during the vernal equinox. The primary caster binds the person to be sacrificed in magically treated ivy and then places the settlement model on top of the person's body. Next, the primary caster slits the sacrifice's throat with a knife and then smears the blood all over the ivy. As the casters chant, the ivy grows and destroys the model of the settlement. If the ritual succeeds, tendrils of the ivy lash out at all of the casters before diving into the ground and reemerging throughout the ritual's area of effect. Vines and other plants appropriate to the region grow over all buildings and structures in the area, dealing damage to them at a rate of 3 hit points every 10 minutes, ignoring their hardness. A typical wooden building can withstand 100 points of damage before being wrecked, while a typical stone building can withstand 150 points of damage before its complete destruction. The plants do not deal damage to creatures directly, though creatures that remain in a building may be injured if it collapses. Heavily fortified stone structures, such as castles and city walls, are sturdy enough to withstand this ritual. Any magical building or room receives a Fortitude save to repel the plants.
