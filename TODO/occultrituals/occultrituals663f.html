Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The primary caster begins by using a peacock feather to dust a circle of crushed malachite around a building or sacred site and calls forth hushed whispers-the murmuring chastisement of the secretive Peacock Spirit-to blot out invasive magics that overhear or reveal secrets. Anyone attempting to cast a divination or enchantment spell or spell-like ability that detects thoughts or compels the truth within the area of effect, or that targets the area of effect with a remote sensing spell such as <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a>, must first make a successful Will save. Failure indicates the spell is lost and the effect's caster takes 1d6+8 points of damage as the Peacock Spirit turns the invasive magic back upon her. Success indicates the effect occurs normally. A caster who successfully saves is unaffected further by the Peacock Spirit's Tranquil Roar ritual for 24 hours or until she leaves and reenter the area of effect.
