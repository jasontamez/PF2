Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

This ritual is cast as part of constructing a campsite. The primary caster and any secondary casters work to secure a 30-foot perimeter around a central campfire. The fire is ringed with ritualistic warding stones, which are required as foci to complete the ritual. These warding stones can be used only once every 7 days, though the primary caster can purchase additional sets of stones if she wishes to create multiple campsites during that time. If the ritual is successful, several effects occur for the duration of the ritual or until the primary caster decides to dispel the ritual (a full-round action).

Alarm: If a living creature that was not within the area at the time of the ritual's completion crosses into the affected area, an audible alarm sounds. The alarm lasts for 2 rounds and is sufficient to wake any creature resting in the campsite.

Defensive Ring: The outermost 5 feet of the area take on a roughened texture, counting as <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay79bd.html?ItemName=Caltrops">caltrops</a> for any creature not within the area of the ritual when the ritual was cast.

Shelter: Creatures within the area of the ritual gain the benefits of <a href="spelldisplay2b11.html?ItemName=endure%20elements">endure elements</a> (CL = character level of the primary caster). They also gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against weather effects.
