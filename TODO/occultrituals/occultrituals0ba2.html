Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

This ritual allows an established coven to induct a new member, allowing the coven to increase in size beyond the usual limit of three members. The newcomer must be a creature that could normally join a coven, such as a hag or a witch with the coven hex. Under the shadow of the new moon, the entire coven and the prospective member must prepare a bowl of rich red wine as they dance and chant, with each member adding handfuls of rare and expensive herbs. At midnight, the coven consumes the wine together. If the ritual is a success, the newcomer becomes a full member of the coven; see the details of forming a coven under the monster entry for a <a href="monsterdisplay5fe8.html?ItemName=Green%20Hag">green hag</a>. Every additional coven member above four increases the ritual skill check DCs by 2. No coven can be larger than 13 members.

Any three coven members can participate together to cast coven spells, as normal. Each additional coven member participating in a coven spell beyond the minimum requirement for a given spell increases the effective caster level of that spell by 1, to a maximum of CL 20th. Every two coven members participating in a coven spell beyond the minimum requirement also increase the saving throw DC by 1. When a coven reaches seven members, it gains the following new spells, which require all seven participants acting in concert to cast: <a href="spelldisplay5676.html?ItemName=create%20undead">create undead</a>, <a href="spelldisplay5c39.html?ItemName=dominate%20person">dominate person</a> (DC 18), <a href="spelldisplaya596.html?ItemName=epidemic">epidemic</a> (DC 19), <a href="spelldisplay6afc.html?ItemName=fairy%20ring%20retreat">fairy ring retreat</a>, <a href="spelldisplay1daa.html?ItemName=major%20curse">major curse</a> (DC 18), <a href="spelldisplay7f42.html?ItemName=magic%20jar">magic jar</a> (DC 18), and <a href="spelldisplay999d.html?ItemName=prying%20eyes">prying eyes</a>.
