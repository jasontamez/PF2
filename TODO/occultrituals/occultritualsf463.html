Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

As the ritual begins, the secondary casters each hold one end of their golden threads while the other is tied to the doll. The secondary casters stretch both arms out toward each other and rhythmically chant their common values (this often involves cult or guild members repeating membership vows). The primary caster ties the doll to her wrist with her golden thread. She then approaches each of the secondary casters in turn and touches them on the forehead with the focus doll. Unlike with normal occult rituals, adding more than four secondary casters does not increase the bonus those casters provide to the ritual's required skill checks.

Upon successful completion of the ritual, each caster's golden thread snaps. One half of each snapped thread melds into the caster and the other half melds into the focus doll (which can't be used as a focus for this ritual again until the duration expires). Each caster gains the effects of a <a href="spelldisplay4607.html?ItemName=status">status</a> spell in regard to each other caster. Additionally, whenever any caster is wounded, unconscious (except for normal sleeping), dying, or poisoned, any of the casters can, as a free action, use <a href="spelldisplayad68.html?ItemName=greater%20teleport">greater teleport</a> to travel to that individual as long as they are on the same plane. If the destination caster is in combat, any teleporting casters roll and enter initiative on the next round, unless they have some other reason to be ready to enter the fray sooner (for example, if they were <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a> on the destination caster). A caster can <a href="spelldisplayad68.html?ItemName=greater%20teleport">greater teleport</a> via this ritual up to once per day.
