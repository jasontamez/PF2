Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The caster begins by rolling the marble around the target object, tracing complex occult patterns. The caster then touches the iron key to the target object four times. The caster repeats the process of rolling the marble and touching the key to the target object three more times, though with each iteration, the marble becomes harder and harder to move, as if it were being pushed through thickening cement. Upon successful completion of the ritual, the marble disappears, and a small, invisible sphere of force surrounds the target object. Any creature holding the iron key used as the focus can pick up and move the target object. Any other creature attempting to touch the target object meets a solid, immovable surface similar to a <a href="spelldisplay5dac.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20force">wall of force</a>. The protective sphere dissipates after 1 month, but it ends immediately if a creature holding the iron key taps it to the object four times in quick succession.
