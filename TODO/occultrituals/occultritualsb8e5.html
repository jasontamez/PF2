Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The first step in destroying the Book of the Damned is to divide the book into four sections-one each for its daemonic, demonic, and infernal portions, and one for its apocrypha. Separating the book into these four parts is both difficult and dangerous. The ritual requires scrubbing the pages with holy water and reciting potent magical words while reading key phrases hidden throughout the text. Upon the successful completion of the ritual, the Book of the Damned tumbles apart into its four components, each of which must be swiftly separated from the others, for should all four components of the Book of the Damned be within 30 feet of each other at any point in time once 1 minute has passed following their separation, they immediately reform into the complete Book of the Damned as if the quartern disjunction had never been performed.
