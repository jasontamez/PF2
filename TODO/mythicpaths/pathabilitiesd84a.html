Mythic Path Abilities










1st-Tier Archmage Path Abilities


You can select these path abilities at any tier.

Abundant Casting (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): Whenever you cast a spell that specifically targets a limited number of targets (such as "one creature/level" or "one or more creatures"), add your tier to the number of targets the spell can affect. For example, a 5th-level wizard/1st-tier archmage can target up to six creatures when casting haste (five from caster level 5th and one from 1st tier). Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a spell that affects only one target (such as "one creature") to have the spell affect an additional target. If the spell requires you to succeed at a melee touch attack, you must hold the charge (Core Rulebook 185) in order to make a second touch attack.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Arcane Endurance (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): Treat your caster level as 4 higher when determining the duration of spells you cast. This doesn't alter any other variable effects of the spell.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bloodline Intensity (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): Your mythic power intensifies your sorcerer bloodline. Select an additional bloodline feat from your bloodline's list of feats. You must meet the prerequisites for that feat. You can also cast each of your bloodline spells once per day without them counting toward the number of spells you can cast per day. You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Competent Caster (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): You automatically succeed at concentration checks to cast arcane spells. This ability doesn't apply to spells of the highest spell level you can cast. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Coupled Arcana (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): Whenever you spend a standard action, move action, or swift action to activate an arcane school power, bardic performance, bloodline power, hex, or magus arcana, you can also activate an ability that uses mythic power as a free action. The mythic ability you activate must require the same action type as the other ability you activated or faster (a swift action is faster than a move action, and a move action is faster than a standard action). </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Coupled Phenomena (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 29</a>): Whenever you spend a standard action, move action, or swift action to implant a mesmerist trick (including masterful tricks), or use a discipline power, focus power, spirit power, touch treatment, or utility wild talent, as a free action you can also activate an ability that uses mythic power. The mythic ability you activate must require the same action type as the other ability you activated or a faster one (a swift action is faster than a move action, and a move action is faster than a standard action).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Crafting Mastery (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): You can craft any magic item as if you had the necessary item creation feats. If you actually have the item creation feat needed for a magic item you're crafting, whenever you attempt a skill check to create that item, roll twice and use the higher result, and you make twice as much progress on the item for any time spent. This ability does not reduce the item's cost or any other requirements. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Deep Understanding (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): You automatically identify any arcane spell cast within 60 feet of you if it's on your class's spell list and you're of a high enough level to cast it. Whenever you attempt to identify a non-artifact magic item using detect magic, you automatically learn its properties and command words in the first round of the spell (no Spellcraft roll needed), but you can't automatically determine whether it's cursed. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eldritch Breach (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): You are adept at breaching magical defenses and overcoming resistance to your magic. When attempting a caster level check to dispel an effect, overcome spell resistance, or otherwise determine whether your magic affects a target (such as with knock or neutralize poison), roll twice and take the higher result. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Elemental Bond (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): You are connected to one of the elemental planes. Select one elemental plane: air, earth, fire, or water. Whenever you cast a spell with a descriptor matching that plane, add your tier to your caster level for that spell. You gain resistance 10 against an energy type associated with your chosen plane-electricity for air, acid for earth, fire for fire, and cold for water. At 6th tier, this resistance increases to 20. At 9th tier, this resistance increases to 30. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Enduring Armor (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 15</a>): You are protected by armor made of force. This armor grants you an armor bonus to AC equal to 3 + your tier. This ability is an abjuration effect with a spell level equal to your tier. If this armor is dispelled or otherwise ended, you can reactivate it as a swift action. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Energy Conversion (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): Whenever you cast a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, or fire descriptor, you can expend one use of mythic power to switch the energy type to a different one of those energy types. If the spell normally has its original energy type as a descriptor, it loses that descriptor and gains the new type as a descriptor. All other effects of the spell remain unchanged. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Enhance Magic Items (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Expanded Implement Knowledge (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 29</a>): Choose a single implement school you have access to. For each spell level that you can cast, you add one additional spell from that school of magic to your list of spells known. Additionally, by expending one use of mythic power as a swift action, you can add 2 points of mental focus to a single implement associated with the chosen implement school. These points of mental focus are created from the expended mythic energy and do not come from your daily allotment of mental focus. You must be touching the implement in which the mental focus will be invested when you use this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Flash of Omniscience (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): Your ability to recall information is astounding. When you take 10 on any Intelligence-based skill check, add your tier to the result. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to ask one question as if using divination. The base chance for a correct answer is 70% + your highest arcane caster level + your tier (maximum 100%). The answer doesn't come from a divine agent, but from your own native understanding; therefore, the answer is never cryptic. If you don't get a correct answer, it's like failing a Knowledge check, and you can't use this ability on this question again. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Flexible Counterspell (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): Your mythic power enhances your ability to counter others' spells. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell. This ability otherwise works like readying an action to counter a spell, except instead of using the exact spell or dispel magic, you can instead expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the target spell. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Flexible School (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): Select one wizard arcane school that is not your arcane school. You gain powers from that arcane school, treating your tier as your wizard level for the purposes of these powers. Once you have chosen the arcane school, it cannot be changed. You cannot select an arcane school that is one of your opposition schools. You must have the arcane school class feature to select this ability. You can choose this ability up to three times, each time selecting another arcane school other than your own.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Greater Familiar Link (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): You have bound yourself so deeply to your familiar that your life forces are intertwined. Anytime you or your familiar takes damage, you may split the damage evenly between you and your familiar as if using shield other. Using this ability doesn't require an action, but it works only if you're conscious and both you and your familiar are alive. You must have a familiar to select this ability. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Harmonious Mage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): Your wizardly studies have moved beyond the concept of opposition schools. Select two opposition schools. These are no longer opposition schools for you, preparing spells from one of these schools now only requires one spell slot of the appropriate level instead of two, and you no longer take the -4 Spellcraft penalty for crafting items from an opposition school. You must have the arcane school class ability to select this ability, and your arcane school can't be universal. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Bloodline (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 16</a>): When determining the effects of your bloodline powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. If you have a sorcerer bloodline power that can be used multiple times per day, such as metamagic adept, you gain a number of extra uses of that power equal to half your tier (minimum 1). You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Hexes (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): Your hexes are more effective against non-mythic targets. When you use a hex that requires a saving throw against a non-mythic target, that target is automatically affected for 1 round (which doesn't count toward the hex's duration) and can't attempt a saving throw to resist the hex. On your turn the next round, the creature attempts its saving throw as normal. If it succeeds at this saving throw, it breaks free of the hex; otherwise, it's affected as normal. You must have the hex class feature to select this ability. You can select this ability twice. If you select it a second time, it also affects your major hexes. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic School (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): When determining the effects of your arcane school powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. If you have an arcane school power that can be used multiple times per day, such as blinding ray, you gain a number of extra uses of that power equal half your tier (minimum 1). You must have the arcane school class feature to select this ability. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Necromantic Mastery (Su) [Cenotaph] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 7</a>): When casting a necromancy spell, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to increase its caster level by your tier (minimum 2).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Perfect Preparation (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): You have discovered the secret to preparing spells without having to refer to outside sources. You no longer need to prepare spells from a spellbook (if you're a magus or wizard) or a familiar (if you're a witch). You still must spend the normal amount of time preparing spells. You may keep or discard your spellbook or familiar. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Rapid Preparation (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): You can prepare a spell in an open spell slot in only 1 minute instead of the normal 15 minutes. You can prepare spells in all of your available spell slots in only 15 minutes instead of the normal 1 hour. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to instantly prepare one spell in an open spell slot. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Reactive Ward (Su) [Mana Well] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 11</a>): As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to ward against a spell that would require you to make a saving throw. You attempt a Spellcraft check instead of your saving throw, with a natural 1 automatically failing and a natural 20 automatically succeeding as normal for saving throws. If you succeed at this check against a spell that has a reduced effect with a successful saving throw, it has no effect on you instead. You must choose to use this ability before rolling the saving throw, and you must be capable of using either verbal or somatic components to enact the ward.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Remixer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 20</a>): You can instantly remix any potion you touch to alter its effects. You can expend one use of mythic power to change the spell or formula contained in a potion or extract to that of any spell or extract you have prepared of the same spell level. The resulting potion uses the caster level of the original potion. The new spell contained in the potion or elixir must be one that could normally serve as a potion. If the effect you are trying to use requires expensive material components, you must provide them at the time of the change. The DC of a Perception check to successfully identify the powers of the potion (normally equal to 15 + the potion's caster level) increases by an amount equal to your tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Resilient Arcana (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): Your spells and effects become more difficult to identify and dispel. Add your tier to the DC of any checks to identify your spells, recognize them as they are being cast, or dispel them using dispel magic or similar effects. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sensory Link (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): As a standard action, you can see and hear through your familiar's eyes and ears. While using this ability, you can't see or hear using your normal senses. You can speak through your familiar using any language you know, even if the familiar can't normally speak. You may end the link and restore your own senses as a standard action. While linked, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast a spell and have it originate from your familiar instead of you. You must have a familiar to select this ability. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shapeshifting Mastery (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 20</a>): Your ability to magically adopt other forms is unparalleled, and you can expertly translate your arcane might into brawn. You add half your tier to the caster level of spells or extracts from the polymorph subschool. While under the effects of a spell or extract of the polymorph subschool, you can use your caster level instead of your base attack bonus when making natural attacks that rely on your new form.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shifting Mastery (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): Whenever you cast or use an arcane polymorph spell, you can grant the target the ability to expend 1 minute of the spell's duration to assume another form allowed by the spell. Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specif ic animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph). This specif ic creature must be known to you, but it doesn't have to be known by the target. The target gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as that individual, but Bluff checks or knowledge of the individual might be required to make the disguise truly convincing. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spellbane Counterstrike (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): With a quick sprint, you retaliate against the caster of a spell you countered. When you successfully counter a spell, you can move up to your speed as part of the counterspell action, as long as you end your movement with the target of the counterspell within melee reach. Your movement from this ability doesn't count toward your total movement for the round. If the target's casting would have provoked an attack of opportunity, you can immediately take an attack of opportunity against the target. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Telekinetic Master (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): You can use mage hand or open/close at will as a standard action, and you can affect unattended magical objects with mage hand. The weight limit for these abilities increases by 5 pounds per tier. Treat your caster level as 2 levels higher when casting levitate, telekinesis, and similar spells. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Throw Spell (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): When casting a melee touch spell, you can expend one use of mythic power to throw that spell as a ranged touch attack. The range of this thrown spell is 10 feet per tier. If the spell allows you to make multiple melee touch attacks, you may make any number of the attacks as melee touch attacks and throw the rest as you see fit.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Transformative Familiar (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 20</a>): Your familiar is able to assume the shape of a single masterwork amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. While it's in this form, treat the familiar as an intelligent magic item with the familiar's mental ability scores but no magical abilities. You can add magical enhancements, intelligent item powers, and intelligent item senses as if you possessed the appropriate crafting feat. (For example, if your familiar transforms into a staff, you could craft it into an intelligent staff of fire as if you possessed the Craft Staff feat.) You must still pay for enhancements as normal. As a standard action, the familiar can transform into and out of its item form and does so in such a way that you can have it immediately equipped when the transformation is complete. While in item form, your familiar retains its original hit points, but gains the hardness of the item it transforms into. If your familiar takes enough points of damage in item form to become broken, it automatically reverts to its familiar form and cannot change to item form again until it is healed to its maximum hit point total. You must have a familiar to select this path ability.</td>

3rd-Tier Archmage Path Abilities


You must be at least 3rd tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Arcane Metamastery (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power and pick any one metamagic feat you know that increases the slot level of the spell by 0 or 1 levels. For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any arcane spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on an arcane spell you cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though this doesn't affect spells already cast). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select this ability, the maximum spell slot level increase of the metamagic feat you can choose goes up by 1, to a maximum of 4.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Arcane Potency (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): Choose one of your arcane spellcasting classes. You gain four bonus 1st-level arcane spell slots for that class (like the bonus spells gained from a high ability score). This ability doesn't change your number of spells known. You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same arcane spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on. This ability can't grant you bonus spells for a spell level that you don't have the ability to cast.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bloodline Immunity (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): The intense power of your sorcerer blood makes you immune to the weapons you rely on. You don't take damage or suffer harmful effects from spells on your bloodline spell list, even ones you aren't of a high enough level to cast. If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using spell turning. Beneficial effects of spells on your bloodline spell list affect you normally. You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Component Freedom (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): When you cast an arcane spell, you can ignore one component of the spell: focus, material, somatic, or verbal. You can ignore a focus or material component only if its total value is equal to or less than 100 gp ?? your tier. You can select this ability more than once; each time you take this ability, the number of components you may ignore for each spell you cast increases by 1.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eldritch Flight (Sp, Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): You gain a bonus on Fly checks equal to your tier. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to fly (as the fly spell) for a number of minutes equal to your tier. At 6th tier, you instead gain a supernatural fly speed of 60 feet (40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or are carrying a medium or heavy load).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Infectious Spell (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 20</a>): You know no limits when it comes to the potency and ravaging effects of your spells. Whenever you cast a spell that specifically targets a limited number of targets (such as "one creature/level" or "one or more creatures") and has a duration longer than 1 round, you can expend one use of mythic power to make the spell infectious. Each round on your turn, so long as at least one creature is still under the effect of the infectious spell, the spell targets one additional enemy per mythic tier you possess. The range of the spell is the same, but it originates from a creature currently affected by the spell (your choice). A creature affected by an infectious spell suffers all of the effects of the original spell (and may attempt any saving throws as appropriate at the original save DC), but the duration does not reset (meaning the effect ends for all affected targets when the original duration of the spell expires). A creature can only be targeted by a given infectious spell once per casting. Once a round passes without any additional creatures affected by the spell, the spell stops being infectious. This ability can only affect spells whose level is equal to or less than double your tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Many Forms (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): You can alter your appearance at will as if using alter self. You can expend one use of mythic power to change shape as if using polymorph, with a duration of 1 minute per tier. Your caster level for this ability is a number equal to 10 + your tier. At 6th tier, the duration of the polymorph ability increases to 10 minutes per tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mirror Dodge (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to replace yourself with an illusory duplicate and teleport to any open square within 30 feet of your current position. You take no damage from this attack, which instead destroys your illusory duplicate (similar to mirror image). Using this ability requires a line of effect to the square into which you teleport.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Amplification (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 29</a>): Whenever you cast a psychic spell, you can expend one use of mythic power to apply a single phrenic amplification you know to the spell, without expending any points from your phrenic pool to do so. The phrenic amplification added in this way does not count against the normal limit of one phrenic amplification per spell. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Spellpower (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): You have a pool of magical power you can draw upon for casting mythic spells (see Chapter 3). Up to twice per day, you can use this power to cast a mythic spell without expending any uses of mythic power. You can select this ability up to three times; each time you do, you gain two additional uses of this ability per day.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Reverse Scrying (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): When you notice a scrying sensor created by a scrying magical effect, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to use that sensor to observe its creator. If the initial scrying effect allows the target a saving throw, the sensor's creator can attempt a saving throw with a DC equal to 10 plus double your tier to realize you are attempting to observe it and block this attempt. If you act strangely once you notice the sensor, its creator might realize you're aware of it; at the GM's discretion, you may need to attempt a Bluff check against the creator's Sense Motive. If your reverse scrying goes unnoticed, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to control what the caster perceives, as if you had cast false vision with a duration of concentration and a caster level equal to double your tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Speedy Summons (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 17</a>): When you cast a summon monster spell, the casting time is 1 standard action instead of 1 round. If you expend one use of mythic power, the casting time becomes 1 swift action. If you're a summoner, as a full-round action you can expend one use of mythic power to summon your eidolon. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this ability. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spell Sieve (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): If you successfully counterspell an arcane spell that is on your spell list and of a level you can cast, you can absorb the countered spell's power and use it for your own purposes. On your next turn, you can cast that spell as a spell-like ability using your arcane spellcaster level as the caster level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tangible Illusion (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 18</a>): You can temporarily transform an illusory object into a real one. As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to temporarily transform a single object created by an illusion spell that you cast into a physical, nonmagical version of that object. The object lasts for 10 minutes per tier, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes, if the duration of the original illusion has expired). During that time, the illusion gains all the physical properties of the depicted illusory object. You must touch the illusion to use this ability, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet per tier. For example, if you create an illusory stone door, you transform it into an actual nonmagical stone door.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Teleportation Master (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 21</a>): You have become an expert at teleportation magic. You can expend one use of mythic power when casting any spell of the teleportation subschool to visualize your destination before you fully materialize there, gaining sensory information of the area as though via a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell. After gaining this sensory information, you can choose to alter your teleportation destination by up to 100 feet in any direction. The new destination must be a legal location for the effect.</td>

6th-Tier Archmage Path Abilities


You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Channel Power (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 19</a>): You gain the ability to channel raw arcane power into a spell. You can also expend one use of mythic power when casting an arcane spell to increase its damage by 50%. If the spell has a duration greater than 1 round, the duration doubles. Any saves required by the spell take a -4 penalty, although for mythic creatures, this penalty is reduced to -2. This spell ignores any spell resistance the targets have, although targets immune to the spell or to magic still retain that protection.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Divine Knowledge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 19</a>): You can use arcane power to cast a small number of divine spells. Choose three 1stlevel spells from the cleric spell list or three 1st-level spells from the druid spell list. You can add those spells to your spellbook (if you're a magus or wizard) or familiar (if you're a witch) for free and can cast those spells as if they were arcane spells on your class list. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time you select it, you choose three more spells from the same class's spell list (cleric or druid), and the highest spell level you can select from increases by 1 (up to 2nd level the second time and up to 3rd level the third time). You must be a magus, witch, or wizard to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Dominion over Outsiders (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 21</a>): You have a way with words when dealing with extraplanar forces called to the Material Plane to serve you. When bargaining with outsiders called via a planar binding or similar spell, you add a bonus equal to your tier on Charisma checks against the called creature and on caster level checks to prevent the creature from escaping your magic circle. In addition, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to half the Hit Dice of the outsider to attempt to bind the outsider to perform a task for up to a year and a day. The creature gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check to refuse this request. If the outsider agrees to carry out this request, it is bound to perform that task for up to a year and a day or until otherwise released (either by completing the task or by your will). You cannot regain that use of mythic power until the outsider is released, effectively decreasing your total number of uses of mythic power per day by the number of uses spent to bind the outsider.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eldritch Reciprocation (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 19</a>): You can choose to take extra damage from an arcane spell to replenish mythic power. When you are hit by or fail a saving throw against an arcane spell that deals hit point damage, as an immediate action you can choose to take damage as if that spell were affected by the Maximize Spell feat. If the spell's damage can't be increased by the Maximize Spell feat or is already under the effect of the Maximize Spell feat, you instead take double damage from it. The spell's damage ignores your spell resistance, energy resistance, energy immunities, and other protections against damage. If you take at least 25 points of damage from the spell, you regain one use of mythic power.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sanctum (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 19</a>): You gain access to your own personal extradimensional sanctum. By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, you conjure the door to your own personal sanctum, similar to mage's magnificent mansion, but with the following differences. The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it-a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door. As a full-round action, your familiar can enter or leave the sanctum from any square adjacent to you, without using the conjured door.</td>

<td>Star Walker (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 21</a>): You can transform your power to enable you to travel great distances. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to surround yourself with a bubble of air enclosed by a thin iridescent layer of force. While this bubble offers no protection from attacks, you can propel yourself through the air at great speed. As long as you concentrate, you gain a fly speed of 240 feet per round. If you cease concentrating, the bubble stops and then sinks 30 feet per round until it reaches the ground and collapses; you can expend one use of mythic power before the bubble collapses to regain control.

In the void of outer space, the bubble's speed is much faster. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system takes 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond takes 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Ceasing concentration while in the void of outer space has no effect on the bubble-it continues traveling in the previously stated direction at the same speed until an outside force slows it down. The air in the sphere is constantly refreshed and kept at a constant temperature, protecting occupants from the void of space, but not necessarily the harsh climates of other planets or planes. By expending two additional uses of mythic power, you can increase the size of the bubble to a 10-foot-radius sphere and you can bring along up to 11 Medium creatures within the bubble. Other creatures can enter or exit the bubble freely.
