Mythic Path Abilities










1st-Tier Hierophant Path Abilities


You can select these path abilities at any tier.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Alter Channel (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 32</a>): If you're in the area of an opponent's channel energy ability and the energy type is the opposite of yours, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to transform the opponent's channeled energy to the opposite type. You can cause the altered energy to either affect the opposite kind of targets (undead or living), or change whether it heals or harms, but not both. Channeled energy that has been changed in this way heals or deals half the normal amount of damage. For example, if an evil cleric attempts to channel negative energy to heal undead, you can expend one use of mythic power to convert that to channeled positive energy that either heals the living or harms undead. You must have the channel energy ability to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Bleed Holy Power (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 33</a>): If you channel positive energy, when an undead creature damages you with a melee attack, you can expend one use of channeled energy as an immediate action to channel energy to deal damage to undead creatures around you (as detailed in the channel energy ability). Alternatively, you may focus this channeled energy so it affects only the undead creature that hit you. If you focus solely on that creature, you are considered 4 levels higher in the class that grants you the channel energy feature when determining its effects.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Channel Shockwave (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 33</a>): You can expend one use of channel energy whenever you score a critical hit against a creature that has an element of alignment opposite to your own (chaotic and lawful are opposite, as are evil and good, so if you were lawful good, you could use this ability against a chaotic creature or evil creature). If you do, add your channel energy damage to the damage from the critical hit. This damage is the same type as your channeled energy (positive or negative) but damages the target regardless of whether it's living or undead. The target can attempt a Will save against your channel energy DC to halve this bonus damage. All other effects of your critical hit still apply.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Contingent Channel Energy (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 33</a>): You can simultaneously expend one use of mythic power and one use of your channel energy ability to delay your channel energy so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate. The conditions needed to bring the channel energy into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the channel effect occurs instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. For example, you could create a trigger that uses your channel positive energy if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. If you prescribe complicated or convoluted conditions, your contingent channel energy ability could fail to trigger. The ability triggers based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You make all decisions about the ability when you expend the use of mythic power, according to what you can normally do with your channel energy ability; if you wish to exclude targets, you must name them at that time. You can have only one use of this ability waiting to be triggered at a time; if you use this ability again, the previous use expires. This use also expires after 1 day per tier if it hasn't been triggered. This use of channel energy can't be regained until after the contingent channel energy ability is triggered or expires.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Divine Countenance (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 33</a>): Whenever you encounter a creature whose alignment is within one step of yours, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate skill check.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Divine Guardian (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 33</a>): As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to summon one extraplanar creature as if using a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, with the level of the summoning spell equal to half your tier. Your caster level for this ability is equal to your character level. You can have only one creature that has been summoned using this ability at a time; summoning another causes the previous one to disappear. If you expend two uses of mythic power, the level of the summoning spell is equal to your tier instead. For example, if you are a 10th-level druid, 5th-tier hierophant, you can use this ability to summon one creature from the summon monster II or summon nature's ally II list (or a lowerlevel list) for 10 rounds; if you expend two uses, you can instead summon one creature from the summon monster V or summon nature's ally V list (or a lower-level list).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Eldritch Breach (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): You are adept at breaching magical defenses and resistance to your magic. When attempting a caster level check to dispel an effect, overcome spell resistance, or otherwise determine whether or not your magic affects a target (such as with knock or neutralize poison), roll twice and take the higher result.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Empathic Healing (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): You can expend one use of mythic power to transfer up to 10 points of damage per tier from a touched ally to yourself, healing the target and damaging you. This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that aff liction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the aff liction.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Endless Bounty (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 26</a>): Whenever you cast create food and water, you can continue to cast it indefinitely (subject to fatigue and other physical constraints) after the initial 10-minute casting time. For every extra 10 minutes you spend casting the spell, you create enough food to sustain an additional number of humans equal to your caster level for 24 hours. At 6th tier, you may also use this ability when you cast heroes' feast.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Enhance Magic Items (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Faith's Reach (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): Whenever you cast a divine spell with a range of touch, you can instead cast the spell with a range of 30 feet. If the spell normally requires a melee touch attack, it instead requires a ranged touch attack.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Flexible Counterspell (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): Your mythic power enhances your ability to counter spells. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell. Upon using this ability, you must identify the spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level). If you correctly identify the spell, you can expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the spell being cast to counter the spell.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Heathen Slayer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): Pick one deity (or similar entity able to grant divine spells to followers) as your religious rival. You gain a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against this deity's followers, as well as a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks attempted against this deity's followers. At 6th tier, these bonuses increase to +4. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you do, choose an additional deity to be a religious rival.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Impeccable Intuition (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 26</a>): Choose one of the following: concealed information, concealed emotion, or secret messages. When talking or dealing with a non-mythic intelligent creature, you always detect the selected type of information without a skill check, though you do not necessarily understand what the information means. For example, realizing that someone is concealing an emotion doesn't necessarily tell you what emotion the person is hiding, whether she's lying, or why. This ability has no effect against mythic creatures. You can select this path ability up to three times. Each additional time you take it, you must choose an additional option.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Insightful Interaction (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 26</a>): Add half your tier to Wisdom-based skill checks in which you are trained. Additionally, by expending one use of mythic power, you can use your Wisdom modifier plus half your tier in place of your Charisma modifier for Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks for 1 hour.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Instrument of Faith (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): You gain DR 15/- against attacks made with your deity's favored weapon. You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to attempt a disarm or sunder combat maneuver check against each opponent within 60 feet that is wielding your deity's favored weapon. You decide individually whether to disarm or sunder each opponent's weapon. Attempt one combat maneuver check, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and adding your tier to the total, and use that result against all opponents.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Inverted Spontaneous Casting (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): If you can spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, you gain the ability to spontaneously cast the opposite type of spell (i.e., you can spontaneously cast inflict spells if you can normally cast cure spells, or cures spell if you can normally cast inflict spells). When spontaneously casting the opposite type of spell, you must use a spell slot that is at least 1 level higher than that of the spell you want to cast. For example, if you can spontaneously cast cure spells and want to spontaneously cast inflict light wounds, you must expend a 2nd-level spell slot.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mighty Summons (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): Each creature you conjure with any summon spell gains DR 5/epic for the duration of the summoning. If you cast a summon spell to summon more than one creature, you summon one additional creature of the same type. If you cast a summon spell to summon just one creature, you can expend one use of mythic power to give it the agile or savage mythic simple template (see page 224) for the duration of the summoning.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Companion (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): Select one animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. That creature can use the surge ability a number of times per day equal to your tier. Its surge ability uses the same bonus die type as you do when you use your surge ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Domain (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): When determining the effects of your domain's granted powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. Once per day, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to regain the use of all your domain granted powers as if you had rested for 8 hours. If you're an oracle, all aspects of this ability apply to your revelations instead of to domain granted powers. You must have the domain class feature or mystery class feature to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Wild Shape (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): Choose one form you can take using wild shape. Using wild shape to take this form doesn't count against your daily uses of wild shape. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, choose another form to not count against your daily uses of wild shape. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Overflowing Grace (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 34</a>): When you heal a creature with positive energy (such as by channeling positive energy to heal the living, using cure spells, or using lay on hands), any affected creature at full hit points (whether already at full hit points or healed to full hit points by your channeled energy) gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. If you channel negative energy to heal undead, this is a profane bonus rather than a sacred bonus.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pack Wild Shape (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): Whenever you use the wild shape class feature, you can also transform allies when you change shape. When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies. The transformation ends for everyone when you return to your normal form or use wild shape again. An ally can end its own transformation early as a standard action without affecting the duration for you or other allies. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Plantbringer (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): All plants within a 1-mile radius of you grow at double their normal rate and don't suffer from any diseases or maladies. Furthermore, allied plant creatures within 30 feet of you gain fast healing equal to your tier. If you use plant shape or wild shape to take the form of a plant, you gain this fast healing in plant form.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Relentless Healing (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): You can restore life to the recently dead. If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to apply healing magic to that creature. This healing can be from a spell or effect you cause or from a magic item you wield. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shielding Phantom (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 29</a>): Your phantom is especially adept at protecting you and your allies from harm. The shield and circumstance bonuses granted by your spiritual interference class feature are both increased by an amount equal to half your mythic tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sustained by Faith (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): You require no food, water, or sleep. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation. If you are 3rd tier or higher, you can expend one use of mythic power in order to also not need to breathe for 24 hours.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Symbol of the Holy (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): As a standard action, you can create a wooden holy symbol dedicated to your deity. If it ever leaves your possession, it fades away after 1 hour. Whenever you use this holy symbol as a divine focus when casting a spell, you don't need to have any other material component, unless that component costs more than 50 gp per tier you possess.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Tongue of the Land (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): Animals, elementals, fey, and plants are magically able to understand you when you speak Druidic, as if you were using speak with animals or tongues. If speaking to creatures of different types at the same time, you can allow all of them to understand you or speak understandably to just one type at a time. For example, if speaking to a group of animals and fey, you can make yourself understandable to all of them, just to the animals, or just to the fey.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Water of Life (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): Any potions you consume have the maximum effect, as if they were created using the Maximize Spell feat. You can quickly create a temporary potion by casting a spell into a pint of water. The spell must be a valid choice for the Brew Potion feat and have a spell level no higher than your tier. The targeted liquid becomes a potion of that spell. If not consumed, the temporary potion reverts to normal water after 1 hour per tier.</td>

3rd-Tier Hierophant Path Abilities


You must be at least 3rd tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Abundant Healing (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): When you use a spell or class ability to heal a creature's hit point damage, you can apply excess healing (over the target's full hit points) to one ally adjacent to you. You can continue to apply excess healing to other adjacent allies until no injured allies are adjacent or you run out of excess healing. For example, if you could cure 40 points of damage with your cure critical wounds spell and the target has taken only 20 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 20 points of healing to an adjacent ally; if that second ally has taken only 15 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 5 points of healing to another adjacent ally.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Alignment Insight (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): You can automatically detect the alignment of any outsider you can see. This ability doesn't function if the creature is magically disguised or has been polymorphed into a different shape. You can automatically detect the alignment of any creature you see casting a divine spell; if that creature worships a deity, you also learn its deity. Spells and effects that mask a creature's alignment prevent the use of this ability. Whenever you cast a spell that affects creatures differently based on their alignment (such as holy smite), you may have the spell treat creatures of one particular alignment as an alignment one step away from that alignment. For example, when casting holy smite, you could treat all lawful neutral creatures as lawful good or lawful evil, all chaotic neutral creature as chaotic good or chaotic evil, or all neutral creatures as neutral good or neutral evil.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Animal Friend (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 35</a>): If you have the wild empathy ability, you can use it as a free action once per round. If you don't have that ability, you can instead attempt Diplomacy checks (with a -8 penalty) to improve the attitude of animals as if they were intelligent creatures. Add your tier to wild empathy or Diplomacy checks to influence animals.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Blessed Companion (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 36</a>): Select one animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. It gains DR 5/epic. This ability can be taken a second time at 6th tier or higher and a third time at 9th tier or higher. Each additional time it's taken, the DR increases by 5.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Divine Metamastery (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 36</a>): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power and pick any one metamagic feat you know that increases the slot level of the spell by 0 levels or 1 level. For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any divine spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on a divine spell cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though any metamagic effects on spells already cast remain). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the maximum spell slot level increase of the metamagic feat goes up by 1 to a maximum of 4.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Divine Potency (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 36</a>): Choose one of your divine spellcasting classes. You gain four bonus 1st-level divine spell slots for that class (like the bonus spells gained from a high ability score). This doesn't change your number of spells known. You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same divine spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on. This ability can't grant you bonus spells for a spell level that you don't have the ability to cast.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Domain Immunity (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 36</a>): You don't take damage or suffer harmful effects from spells on your domain spell list, even ones you aren't of a high enough level to cast. If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using spell turning. Beneficial effects of spells on your domain spell list affect you normally. If you're an oracle, this ability applies to your mystery's bonus spells. You must have the domain class feature or mystery class feature.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Enduring Blessing (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 36</a>): Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of 10 minutes per level or longer upon one willing target, you can change that spell's duration to 24 hours. If the spell has other duration conditions, those still apply (for example, the duration of stoneskin changes to 24 hours or until discharged). A creature can't be subject to more than one spell affected by this ability at a time; if another is cast upon the creature, the first one ends. You can select this ability a second time at 6th tier or higher. The second time you select it, you can use it on spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or longer.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Flowers in Your Footsteps (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 26</a>): As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to radiate an aura of plant growth. Vegetation within 60 feet of you grows rapidly, as though you had cast the overgrowth version of plant growth (caster level equal to your character level). This ability lasts for 1 minute per tier, and follows you wherever you move until the duration expires or you end the effect as a free action. You are immune to the effects of this overgrowth, as are any allies you designate upon using this ability, up to a maximum number of creatures equal to your tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hand of Mercy (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 36</a>): If you have the channel energy ability, you can touch a creature and expend one use of channel energy to remove a condition aff licting that creature. Each time you use this ability, you can choose one of the following conditions: dazed, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered. At 6th tier, you can also choose from among the cursed, exhausted, frightened, and nauseated conditions. At 9th tier, you can also choose from among the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hear the Word (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 26</a>): When you cast a spell such as augury that gives you information directly from a divine source, you can expend one use of mythic power to reduce the casting time to a standard action and have the answer be audible in the unmistakable voice of your deity, granting you a bonus equal to your tier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against those who hear the voice for a number of hours equal to your tier. If you expend one additional use of mythic power, the voice deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per tier to enemies within 60 feet of you who can hear it, and they are stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wis modifier) halves the damage and negates the stun effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Hurling Vengeance (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 36</a>): Whenever you are wielding your deity's favored weapon or your paladin bonded weapon, you can throw it as if it had the returning and throwing weapon special abilities. If using a paladin bonded weapon, it retains its bonded abilities when thrown this way. By expending one use of mythic power as part of a full attack, the weapon returns to you immediately after each time you throw it (instead of just before your next turn) allowing you to make your full number of attacks that round.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Life Current (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 37</a>): You are more attuned to the source of life or unlife and better able to access its power. When casting a cure or inflict spell or use a class feature that uses positive or negative energy (such as channel energy or lay on hands), treat any natural 1s on the dice rolled to heal or deal damage as 2s. You can select this ability up to four times. The second time you select it, treat natural 1s and 2s as 3s. The third time you select it, treat natural 1s, 2s, and 3s as 4s. The fourth time, treat natural 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s as 5s.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mind to Mindlessness (Su) [Cenotaph] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 7</a>): You possess the ability to wipe the mind of an intelligent undead, leaving the creature intact but mindless as a result. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to target a single non-mythic intelligent undead creature within 60 feet with a blast of necromantic energy. Alternatively, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to target a mythic creature. The target can attempt a Will save against the effect (DC = 10 + half your tier + either your Charisma or Wisdom modif ier, whichever is higher). If the target fails, its Intelligence score drops to -, leaving the creature mindless for a number of rounds equal to your tier. A target that fails its save receives a new saving throw each round to overcome the effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Treatment (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 29</a>): Whenever you use your touch treatment class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant the touched creature a new saving throw to resist a single harmful effect that initially allowed a Fortitude or Will save to resist. The touched creature gains a bonus on this saving throw equal to half your mythic tier. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends immediately. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pilgrim of the Waves (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 27</a>): You can breathe water as easily as you breathe air. You can also walk on any body of water, as water walk, except this ability does not allow you to walk upon any bodies of liquid other than water. You can choose to sink to the bottom of any body of water you could walk upon, descending at a rate of 60 feet per round, and thereafter you can travel along the bottom of the water as though it were dry land. While at the bottom of a body of water, you can attack and act normally, as though under the effects of a freedom of movement spell, though this ability does not impart the other benefits of that spell.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Shape Channel (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 27</a>): As a standard action, you can simultaneously expend one use of mythic power and one use of your channel energy ability to channel energy in a 60-foot cone, a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 20-foot radius, or a 120-foot line. In addition, whenever you channel energy to damage creatures (whether undead creatures with positive energy or living creatures with negative energy), you can choose to deal half damage (or one-quarter damage to creatures that succeed at their saving throws) and then push back all creatures damaged by the effect. You push each creature back 5 feet for every 1d6 points of channel energy damage you are capable of dealing. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws against your channeled energy are only pushed back half as far (minimum 5 feet). You must have the channel energy class feature to select this path ability.</td>

6th-Tier Hierophant Path Abilities


You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Arcane Knowledge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 37</a>): You can use divine power to cast a small number of arcane spells. Choose three 1st-level spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list or three 1st-level spells from the bard spell list. You can add those spells to your list of spells that you can prepare each day. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time you select it, you choose three more spells from the same class's spell list (sorcerer/wizard or bard), and the highest spell level you can select from increases by 1 (up to 2nd level the second time and up to 3rd level the third time). You must be a cleric or druid to select this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Conduit of Divine Will (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 37</a>): Your mythic nature is directly connected to the divine. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to use channel energy, use lay on hands, or cast any one spell from your domain spell lists (as long as you can normally prepare a spell of that level). Whenever you use this ability, you also gain spell resistance equal to 10 + your tier and a +4 sacred bonus (or profane bonus if you're evil) to your AC for a number of rounds equal to your tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Overcome Curse (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 37</a>): You are immune to curse effects. For example, bestow curse has no effect on you, and you can handle, carry, or discard a cursed magic item without harm. If a cursed item has useful functions and a cursed effect (such as armor of arrow attraction) or drawback (such as a mace of blood), you are immune to the cursed effect and drawback, and can still use its other abilities. If a cursed item works normally for a period of time before its curse triggers (such as gauntlets of fumbling), the item stops working for you when the curse would normally trigger. If you're an oracle, you can ignore the negative effects of your oracle's curse.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pilgrim of the Sky (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 27</a>): You can walk on clouds as easily as flat land, and are never affected by altitudebased effects such as altitude sickness. If you are on a mountain or other geographically high location, you can simply step from the earth onto the clouds. Otherwise, you must find your own way to the clouds overhead if you wish to walk on them. This ability only works when there are clouds present; you cannot walk on clear skies. You can expend one use of mythic power to use air walk (caster level equal to your character level). You may expend one additional point of mythic power to grant the same ability to an ally touching you. There is no limit to the number of allies you can affect with this ability. At 9th tier, you can expend one use of mythic power to use overland flight.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Psychic Healing (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 29</a>): Whenever you use your touch treatment class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant the touched creature a new saving throw to resist a single harmful effect that initially allowed a Fortitude or Will save to resist. The touched creature gains a bonus on this saving throw equal to half your mythic tier. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends immediately. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Puppet Master (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 27</a>): As a standard action, you can temporarily raise a dead creature within 60 feet to serve as your puppet for up to a number of rounds equal to your tier or until you end this effect as a free action, whichever comes first. In order to use this ability, you must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to half the target's Hit Dice. The creature must have been slain within a number of rounds equal to your tier. You imbue the creature with enough positive or negative energy to allow its body to function without its spirit. This shell of a creature gains the mindless quality, and it acts like a puppet with you as the puppeteer. The creature is neither living nor dead, and positive and negative energy have no effect on the creature. It immediately regains half its maximum number of hit points, which becomes its new maximum hit point total for the duration of this effect. You can command the puppet as though it were under the effects of a dominate monster spell cast by you (no save), and it can use any of the abilities it normally had access to at the time of death (prepared spells, special abilities, and so on). The puppet must still have all the necessary components to activate special abilities and spells. Abilities that normally refresh periodically, like breath weapons, do not refresh. Once the puppet takes an amount of damage equal to its total number of hit points or the duration of this effect ends, the puppet is destroyed and becomes a corpse once again. The puppet can be affected as normal by resurrection spells and effects during this time, which immediately end the effects of this ability. You can't affect the same creature with this ability more than once in 24 hours. You must have the channel energy class feature to select this path ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Servant of Balance (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 37</a>): Whenever a critical hit is confirmed against you, the attack deals normal damage instead of critical damage. Other effects that trigger on a successful critical hit (such as the Blinding Critical feat, the fire damage from a critical hit with a flaming burst weapon, or the effects of a vorpal weapon) all affect you normally.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Undying Healer (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 37</a>): Whenever you fall unconscious, a ghostly image of you manifests from out of your body. Even though you're unconscious, you control this image. On your turn each round, this image can fly up to 30 feet and use your ability to lay on hands to heal, channel energy to heal, or cast any conjuration (healing) spell that you could cast. This consumes these abilities as normal. Abilities used by the image can't benef it you. This image lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. This ability can be dispelled, using double your tier as the caster level. If you die or regain consciousness, the image immediately ends.</td>
