Mythic Path Abilities










1st-Tier Universal Path Abilities


You can select these path abilities at any tier.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Akitonian Physiology (Ex) [Doorway to the Red Star] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 9</a>): When you select this path ability, you permanently reshape your body in imitation of the alien species of Akiton, permanently gaining the benefits of one of the following alchemist discoveries: chameleon, preserve organs, tumor familiar, or vestigial arm. Your alchemist level for the purpose of this ability is equal to your tier plus your alchemist level. You can select this path ability multiple times, each time selecting a new permanent mutation. Each time beyond the first that you take this path ability, your pool of mythic power is permanently reduced by 1 (as that power is used to maintain your alien physiology) and you take a cumulative -1 penalty on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with animals, fey, and humanoids.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>As Foretold (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9gro?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Shores">Distant Shores pg. 12</a>): Mythic characters of at least 1st tier who gain mythic power from a cyclops myth-speaker can select the following mythic path abilities.

Just as the cyclopes foretold your mythic ascension, so too can you foresee your own greatness. As a full-round action you can expend two uses of mythic power to roll your mythic surge die and add 10 (treat any result of 21 or higher as 20). At any point within the next 10 minutes, you may use the result of the roll as the result of any one d20 roll you are required to make. If you do not use the result within 10 minutes, it is lost. You can use this ability to replace an attack roll or saving throw only once per day each.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Borrow Mythic Power (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 31</a>): As a move action, you can call on a channeled spirit to grant you a fraction of its mythic power. Your channeled spirit gains 1 point of influence over you, and you gain two uses of mythic power. Uses of mythic power gained in this way are lost once the spirit leaves you, and they can be spent only on path abilities from the same mythic path with which the spirit is associated.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Commune with Power (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): You can tap into your mythic nature to seek answers to the quandaries you encounter in your adventures. Once per day, in a special ritual that requires you to spend 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation, you can commune with the source of your power. This acts as the commune spell, using your tier as your caster level. The source of your power may be limited in the knowledge it possesses or can deliver, as decided upon by the GM.</td>

You can't reduce the duration below 1 round. You can use this ability even when otherwise denied the ability to take actions, as long as you're conscious. You can reduce the duration of an effect multiple times, using a swift action each time.</td>

Alternatively, you can use this ability to apply a +20 circumstance bonus to your Constitution score for a number of hours equal to your mythic tier for the purpose of making Constitution checks against heat, cold, fatigue, and exhaustion.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Display of Wisdom (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a feat of Wisdom, gaining a +20 circumstance bonus on one Wisdom-based skill check or Wisdom ability check.</td>

<td>Extra Mythic Feat (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): You gain an extra mythic feat. You can take this ability a number of times equal to half your mythic tier (minimum 1). Each time you do, you gain another mythic feat.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Extra Mythic Power (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): You can call upon your mythic power two additional times per day. You can select this ability up to three times.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Legendary Item (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): You gain a <a href="rules1b52.html?Name=Legendary%20Item%20Abilities&amp;Category=Legendary%20Items">legendary item</a>. This item grants a number of abilities equal to your tier (maximum 3). At 3rd tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to six abilities and causing the item to become a lesser artifact. At 6th tier, you can select this ability again, increasing the maximum to 10 abilities; the item then becomes a greater artifact.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Longevity (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): Upon taking this ability, you can no longer die from old age. If you have penalties to your physical ability scores due to aging, you no longer take those penalties. You still continue to age, and you gain all the benefits to your mental ability scores.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mortal Herald (Sp) [Must complete a Herald trial, see Mythic Origins for details] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90qd?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Mythic-Origins">Mythic Origins pg. 16</a>): You become a mortal herald of your chosen deity. Choose a domain granted by your deity. Once chosen, this cannot be changed. By expending one use of mythic power, you may cast a domain spell granted by that domain as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to your character level), provided the spell's level is not greater than your tier. In addition, if you are at least 6th tier, once per day you may commune with your deity (as the commune spell). If you expend one use of mythic power while doing so, this ability is a free action and time stops (from the point of view of everyone else) to allow you to ask your questions and receive answers instantly.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Burn (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 31</a>): You are able to convert mythic energy into the energy used to fuel your kinetic powers, and vice versa. You can expend mythic power to reduce the total burn cost of a blast or utility wild talent on a one-for-one basis. Alternatively, you can accept 1 point of burn in place of expending one use of mythic power. You must have the burn class feature to select this path ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Craft (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): When you use the Craft skill to create an item, you double the progress each check provides. In addition, you can make an item masterwork simply by paying for the cost, and don't need to increase the time to create the item or attempt additional checks. Add your tier to any skill checks associated with making magic items.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Spellcasting (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): You can learn a number of mythic spells equal to your tier and can expend mythic power when casting them to enhance the results. To select a mythic spell, you must be able to cast the non-mythic version or have it on your list of spells known. Every time you gain a new tier, you can select an additional mythic spell. You can take this ability up to three times. Each additional time you take it, you can select an additional number of spells equal to your tier and you gain one additional mythic spell whenever you gain a tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Sustenance (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): Your mythic power is enough to sustain you. You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe to live. You're immune to inhaled poisons and any spell or effect that requires breathing, though you are still affected by any food or drink you intake.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Occult Mastery (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 31</a>): You are a master of <a href="rules79d0.html?Name=Occult%20Skill%20Unlocks&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">occult skill unlocks</a>. You gain a bonus equal to your mythic tier on skill checks made as part of an occult skill unlock, and you can use each occult skill unlock you have access to a number of additional times per day equal to your mythic tier. Further, by expending one use of mythic power, you gain the ability to use an occult skill unlock you would not otherwise have access to (whether because you cannot cast psychic spells or because you are not trained in that skill). You can use this occult skill unlock until the next time you regain uses of mythic power. The extra uses of occult skill unlocks granted by this ability also apply to skill unlocks you gain access to in this way.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pierce the Darkness (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): You gain permanent darkvision with a 60-foot range, as the universal monster ability. If you possess darkvision, the range increases by 60 feet.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Returning Flasks (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy959n?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Alchemy-Manual">Alchemy Manual pg. 26</a>): Whenever you throw a splash weapon but fail to land a direct hit against your target, as a free action you can will your splash weapon to return to you at the beginning of your next turn, as if it were enchanted with the returning weapon special ability. The splash weapon has no effect and deals no damage when you use this ability. Alternatively, by expending one use of mythic power as a swift action when you make a failed ranged attack with a splash weapon, you can choose which square the splash weapon lands in.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Seal of the Star Tower (Su) [Star Tower] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 15</a>): As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a melee touch attack. If the attack hits, the target can't use spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that require actions. You can't affect a target whose mythic tier exceeds your own. The effects of this ability last for 1 round. You can expend two additional uses of mythic power to increase the duration to 2 rounds. You can affect a given creature with seal of the Star Tower only once within any 24-hour period.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Seat of Power (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9gro?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Distant-Shores">Distant Shores pg. 12</a>): Mythic characters of at least 1st tier who gain mythic power from a cyclops myth-speaker can select the following mythic path abilities.

You can grant divine spells, but doing so requires considerable effort and only functions over a limited area. When you choose this path ability, choose a temple, monument, tree, or similar structure to serve as the principle holy site for your burgeoning religion. This site has a limited area of influence that extends in all directions a number of miles equal to 10 times your mythic tier. This functions in all ways as the Divine Source universal path ability (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 51) with two limitations. First, you can only grant spells to followers who prepare their spells within your holy site's area of influence. Second, you must spend at least 10 minutes in contact with the holy site and expend one use of mythic power each day to continue granting spells to your followers. While doing so, you may choose to expend two additional uses of mythic power in order to increase your effective tier by one when determining what level spells you can grant. If you later gain the Divine Source path ability, this ability instead permanently increases your effective tier by one when determining what level spells you can grant, and once per day by spending at least 10 minutes in contact with your holy site, you can regain one use of mythic power for every 3 tiers you possess.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Splash Back (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy959n?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Alchemy-Manual">Alchemy Manual pg. 26</a>): Whenever you throw a splash weapon, any creatures providing your target with soft cover take splash damage from your attack. Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a splash weapon, you can expend one use of mythic power to forgo the multiplied damage against your target and instead deal a direct hit to both the target and a creature adjacent to the target. Creatures adjacent to either of these two creatures take splash damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Touched by the Depths (Su) [Mordant Spire] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 13</a>): You gain the hold breath ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 298). You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to gain a swim speed equal to your land speed, the ability to breathe water, and tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet that only functions while under water. The ability to breathe water does not hinder your ability to breathe air. These effects last for 10 minutes per mythic tier.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Voice of the Spire (Su) [Mordant Spire] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 13</a>): A voice only you can hear warns you of peril. If you're unaware at the start of a surprise round, you can expend one use of mythic power to act in that surprise round. When acting in a surprise round, you can expend two uses of mythic power to take both a standard and a move action (or a full-round action) in the surprise round. This ability doesn't prevent you from being flat-footed before you have acted.</td>

3rd-Tier Universal Path Abilities


You must be at least 3rd tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Beyond Morality (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 50</a>): You have no alignment. You can become a member of any class, even one with an alignment requirement, and can never lose your membership because of a change in alignment. If you violate the code of ethics of any of your classes, you might still lose access to certain features of such classes, subject to GM discretion. Attempts to detect your alignment don't return any results. If a class restricts you from casting spells with an alignment descriptor, you can cast such spells without restrictions or repercussions. If you're the target of a spell or effect that is based on alignment, you're treated as the most favorable alignment when determining the spell's effect on you. Any effects that alter alignment have no effect on you. If you lose this effect, you revert to your previous alignment.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Binding Ritual (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9e1c?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Cohorts-Companions">Cohorts and Companions pg. 10</a>): You have learned the eldritch rituals required to draw creatures from the planes into your presence. If you are a spellcaster, you add the following spells to your list of spells known: binding, dimensional anchor, magic circle against chaos, magic circle against evil, magic circle against good, magic circle against law, planar binding, planar binding (greater), and planar binding (lesser). If these spells are not normally on your class list, you add them to your list of spells known at the level they appear on the sorcerer/wizard spell list, though you do not gain spells whose level exceeds the level of spells your class can cast.

Whether or not you are a spellcaster, you can expend one use of your mythic power to create a magic circle (of any type) as part of a calling diagram; if you expend an additional use of your mythic power, this diagram is fortified with dimensional anchor. If you are at least 9th level, you may also spend two uses of your mythic power to cast lesser planar binding as a spell-like ability. If you are at least 11th level and 6th tier, you can expend three uses of your mythic power to cast planar binding as a spell-like ability. If you are at least 15th level and 9th tier, you can expend four uses of your mythic power to cast greater planar binding as a spell-like ability. For all these effects, treat your mythic tier as your caster level, unless your own caster level is higher.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Defy Death (Su) [Cenotaph] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 7</a>): As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +5 bonus on a single saving throw made to resist energy drain, a death effect, or a negative level becoming permanent. You can select this path ability multiple times. If you take it a second time, you gain a +10 bonus on saving throws to resist the above effects. If you take it three times, you can instead expend one use of mythic power to automatically succeed at a saving throw made to resist the above effects.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Divine Source (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): You can grant divine spells to those who follow your cause, allowing them to select you as their deity for the purposes of determining their spells and domains. Select two domains upon taking this ability. These domains must be alignment domains matching your alignment if possible, unless your alignment is neutral. You grant access to these domains as if you were a deity. Creatures that gain spells from you don't receive any spells per day of levels higher than your tier; they lose those spell slots. In addition, you can cast spells from domains you grant as long as their level is equal to or less than your tier. Each day as a spell-like ability, you can cast one spell of each level equal to or less than your tier (selecting from those available to you from your divine source domains). If you're a cleric or you venerate a deity, you may change your spell domains to those you grant others. At 6th tier and 9th tier, you can select this ability again, adding one domain and two subdomains (see the Advanced Player's Guide) to your list each time and adding their spells to the list of those that you can cast.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Enhanced Ability (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): You gain a permanent +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice. You can select this path ability up to six times. Each time you do, it must apply to a different ability score.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Fearless (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): Few things in the world still inspire fear in you. You are immune to all fear effects from nonmythic sources. Fear effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Interplanar Prestige (Ex, Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9e1c?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Cohorts-Companions">Cohorts and Companions pg. 10</a>): Your mighty accomplishments have drawn the notice of creatures beyond your home plane. You gain a bonus equal to half your mythic tier on Diplomacy checks against outsiders with an alignment subtype that matches at least one portion of your alignment, and on Intimidate checks against outsiders with an alignment subtype that opposes at least one portion of your alignment. If you have the Leadership feat, you add half your mythic tier to your Leadership score for the purpose of attracting an outsider cohort.

In addition, if you are at least 7th level, you can expend two uses of your mythic power to cast lesser planar ally as a spell-like ability, treating your mythic tier as your caster level. If you are at least 11th level and 6th tier, you can expend three uses of your mythic power to cast planar ally. If you are at least 15th level and 9th tier, you can expend four uses of your mythic power to cast greater planar ally. You must provide the required offering to bargain for your ally's service.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Contact (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 31</a>): You learn the true name of a particularly powerful and knowledgeable outsider with up to 20 Hit Dice. When using your outside contact class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power to conjure this particularly potent contact instead of one of your other contacts. If you do, the contact can provide much more detailed information, such as anything that can be learned with a <a href="spelldisplay9275.html?ItemName=legend%20lore">legend lore</a> spell, and the contact can provide the information immediately. However, the cost is much higher: typically 1,000 gp, although in some cases the contact may instead accept services or an exchange of information. As with outside contact, you can attempt to bargain with the contact, using Diplomacy or Intimidate to try to halve the payment cost. Failure causes the cost to be doubled, and failure by 5 or more causes the mythic contact to depart without providing information of any kind. Typically, a mythic contact will not lower itself to delivering messages, but at the GM's discretion, it may be willing to perform other services for you in exchange for appropriate compensation. You must be at least 3rd tier and have the outside contact class feature to select this path ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pure Body (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): Your body is so pure that you're immune to all non-mythic diseases and poisons. Diseases and poisons from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pure Destiny (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): Your mythic destiny is guided by providence. You're immune to all non-mythic curses and compulsions. Curses and compulsions from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pure Senses (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): Your senses are extraordinarily keen. You're immune to blindness and deafness caused by nonmythic sources. Such effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Sleepless (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): You no longer require sleep, don't become fatigued or exhausted from lack of sleep, and are immune to sleep effects. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Spellscarred (Su) [Mana Well] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 11</a>): When you're targeted by or inside the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, you can call upon your mythic power to gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your character level + your mythic tier against that effect alone. If the spell fails to bypass your spell resistance, one of your uses of mythic power is expended; otherwise, the ability has no cost. Using this ability doesn't require an action, but you must be aware of the effect, be able to take actions, have at least one use of mythic power remaining, and not be flat-footed to use this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Telepathic Mindlink (Sp) [Doorway to the Red Star] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 9</a>): You can expend one use of mythic power to cast sending or telepathic bond with a caster level equal to double your tier. If you take this path ability twice, you gain a permanent telepathic bond with one other creature. You can change the creature with whom you share the bond in a special ritual that takes 1 hour.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ultimate Versatility (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): Once per day, you can temporarily change one decision made for one of your class features. This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. During this time, you're treated as if you had always had the new class feature. For example, you could use this ability to change the decision made with the arcane bond class feature, causing your bonded item to disappear (along with all of its bonuses and restrictions) and a familiar to appear in its place. This doesn't affect any prepared spells or spells you have already cast. If the new ability is limited in its uses per day, you receive half the normal number of uses (minimum 1). When this ability ends, your previous choice returns with the same number of uses as before you used this ability. If you use this ability to change a class feature that grants access to spells (such as a bloodline, patron, domain, or school), you lose access to any spells from the old choice but don't gain the ability to cast new spells. When the effect ends, the previous spells return and can be cast again. You can use this ability to change a feat or skill if you receive it from a class feature, but any other abilities that rely on the missing feat or skill as a prerequisite don't function while this ability is in effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Unchanging (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): Your form is so stable that you become immune to non-mythic polymorph and petrification effects. Polymorph and petrification from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Waters of Contemplation (Su) [Doorway to the Red Star] (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 9</a>): You can meditate for 1 hour and expend one use of mythic power to transmute any magical potion into an alchemical cognatogen that increases your mental faculties at the expense of your physical prowess (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 15) usable only by you. Your effective alchemist level for this cognatogen is equal to your tier plus your alchemist level. If you are at least 6th tier, you can use this ability to create a greater cognatogen. If you are at least 9th tier, you can use this ability to create a grand cognatogen. If you expend one additional use of mythic power when brewing the waters of contemplation, you gain the benefit of tongues for as long as the cognatogen lasts.</td>
</tr>

6th-Tier Universal Path Abilities


You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Farwalker (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): The boundaries of the Material Plane mean little to you. You can plane shift once per day, using double your tier as your caster level. You can take this ability twice. When you take it a second time, you can use this ability three times per day.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Presence (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): Your power unnerves ordinary mortals. By expending one use of mythic power, you gain an effect similar to frightful presence, except that creatures are affected according to their tier (or rank, in the case of monsters) instead of their Hit Dice. Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they fail. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank higher than yours are unaffected by your mythic presence. The Will save against your mythic presence equals 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. This ability lasts for 1 minute and has a range of 30 feet.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Mythic Sight (Sp) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 51</a>): When you take this ability, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. You can take this ability twice. The second time you take it, you can see illusions and magical deceptions for what they truly are, as if using true seeing. This ability doesn't apply to illusions and magical effects that were cast by other mythic creatures or that are affecting other mythic creatures.

<td>Phantom Possession (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 31</a>): As a full-round action, by expending one use of mythic power, you can invite your phantom to control your body while you project your spirit incorporeally. While your spirit is outside of your body in this fashion, you become incorporeal and gain a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect), but your statistics remain otherwise unchanged. Your projected spirit has incorporeal versions of all of your equipment, although consumable equipment and equipment with limited numbers of charges or uses cannot be used while incorporeal. At the same time, your phantom takes control of your body, as the spell possessionOA. You can end the effect at any time by returning to your body, and it ends automatically after 1 minute per mythic tier unless you expend an additional use of mythic power to extend the duration. If your spiritual form is slain, your spirit returns to your body automatically and the effect ends. You must be at least 6th tier and have the phantom class feature to select this path ability.</td>
