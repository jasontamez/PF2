Description

This modification enhances a construct's physical weaponry. This process includes adding actual weapons (such as blades or spiked chains) to the physical structure of the construct or enhancing existing weapons with additional magical properties. Structural changes alter the construct's damage only. A construct is automatically considered proficient with any weapon added to its structure as a weapon modification. The cost for adding a weapon is determined by the cost of the weapon or weapon enhancement added. The cost for magical enhancements to these weapons is the same as the cost for creating magic weapons as described in <a href="rules2135.html?Name=Magic%20Weapons&amp;Category=Magic%20Items">Magic Weapons</a>. Performing a weapon modification also requires the <a href="featdisplay6316.html?ItemName=Craft%20Magical%20Arms%20and%20Armor">Craft Magical Arms and Armor</a> feat.
