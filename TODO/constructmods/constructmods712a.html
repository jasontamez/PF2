Description

This modification improves a construct's existing movement. This modification can improve a construct's land speed, increasing the speed by 10 feet, up to a total speed equal to double its original land speed. Each 10-foot improvement costs 2,000 gp. Constructs with a climb or swim speed can improve these speeds by 10 feet, up to a total speed equal to double the original speed, at a cost of 3,000 gp per 10-foot improvement. Constructs with a fly speed can improve these speeds by 10 feet, up to a total speed equal to double the original speed, at a cost of 4,000 gp per 10-foot improvement.

Constructs can also gain new means of locomotion with this modification. A construct can gain a climb or swim speed of 15 feet at a cost of 6,000 gp. A construct can gain a fly speed of 15 feet at a cost of 8,000 gp so long as it has at least 5 Hit Dice. A Tiny or smaller construct gains a maneuverability of good, a Medium or Small construct gains a maneuverability of average, a Large or Huge construct gains a maneuverability of poor, and Gargantuan or larger constructs gain a maneuverability of clumsy.
