Description

This modification creates an extradimensional space within the construct, allowing the creator and her allies to store objects within the construct. The construct's size determines the amount of storage available. A Small construct contains 4 cubic feet of space that can hold up to 25 pounds. This space and weight limit is doubled for each size category larger than Small, up to a total of 128 cubic feet and a weight limit of 800 pounds for a Colossal construct. The construct can retrieve any object held within this space as a swift action. Other creatures accessing this space can retrieve an object as a move action. This extradimensional space otherwise functions like a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay8887.html?FinalName=Bag%20of%20HoldingType%20I">bag of holding</a>.
