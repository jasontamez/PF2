Description

This modification allows a construct to use some of the innate magic that powers its body to repair damage to itself. As a swift action, the construct can gain fast healing 5. A construct can activate this fast healing for a number of rounds per day equal to half its Hit Dice (minimum 1 round). These rounds do not need to be consecutive. A construct can gain this modification multiple times. Each time, the total number of rounds per day increases by a number equal to half the construct's Hit Dice (minimum 1 round), up to a maximum equal to double the construct's Hit Dice. Constructs that already have the fast healing ability instead increase their fast healing value by 2, up to a maximum equal to double the construct's original fast healing value.
