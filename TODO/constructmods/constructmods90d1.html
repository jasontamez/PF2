Description

This modification grants resistances to a construct or improves existing resistances. The construct gains energy resistance 5 to one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This base resistance costs 4,000 gp. This modification can also improve resistance to the above energy types, up to a total equal to double the original value or 15, whichever is lower. Improving energy resistance in this way costs 6,000 gp for every increment of 5 by which the resistance is increased. Constructs with vulnerability to one of the above energy types, such as an ice golem's vulnerability to fire, cannot gain resistance to that energy type with this modification.
