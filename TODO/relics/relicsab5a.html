This meticulously woven flag depicts a horse and an elephant, both about to charge. The tapestry's green and blue colors underscore the beasts' connection to Taldor's distinguished cavalry, the Taldan Horse, in which they have long been the most commonly used mounts. Though this particular piece of heraldry is rather rare in all reaches of the empire, those who know their Taldan military history know that this banner's design has been used for hundreds of years.

The following effects apply only if the standard is wielded or carried, and it must be attached to the shaft of a lance, polearm, spear, staff, or similar. The standard-bearer and all allies within 60 feet who can see the banner gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws. They also increase their base speed or fly speed and the base speed or fly speed of mounts they ride by 5 feet. This is treated as an enhancement bonus and doesn't give a creature a base speed or fly speed if it didn't have one already. A creature determines whether it can see the banner for the purposes of speed increase at the start of its turn, and it keeps the extra speed even if it moves out of sight later in that turn.

Once per day when the wielder begins a charge action, the standard bearer can use a swift action to call for a battle charge, causing the speed increase from the standard to become 20 feet for 1 round. Any affected creature that charges during this round also ignores the penalty to AC from its charge.

First Triumph: Once per day, the standard bearer can activate the banner to teleport himself and up to five allies who are within 10 feet of him. This functions as <a href="spelldisplay0446.html?ItemName=dimension%20door">dimension door</a>, and each transported creature must arrive within 10 feet of the

standard of conquest.

Second Triumph: When the standard bearer calls for a battle charge, each affected creature gains a fly speed of 30 feet for 1 minute. The standard bearer can call for a battle charge twice per day.

Third Triumph: The standard bearer and allies within 60 feet who can see the standard gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls. When the standard bearer calls for a battle charge, each affected creature is also affected by <a href="spelldisplay4d39.html?ItemName=%20heroism,%20greater">greater heroism</a> with a duration of 1 minute.
