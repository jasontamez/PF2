Introduced In
Aura moderate evocation
Slot armor; CL 9th
Weight 25 lbs.
This ramshackle suit of full plate looks cobbled together from old pieces scavenged from several suits of armor, each proudly displaying an insignia of the Taldan royal family. The armor shines with a glimmer of holy light.

This suit of +2 mithral full plate is covered in dozens of markings representing Taldor's royal family, and it grants the wearer a relic reservoir of 1 point. By spending 1 point whenever she gains a morale bonus, the wearer can increase her morale bonus by 1 for the effect's duration (maximum 24 hours). The relic reservoir regains its points once per day when the wearer meditates in quiet contemplation for 1 hour, which can be done as part of an 8-hour rest. Taldaris's Bequeathal bestows 1 permanent negative level to any evil creature who attempts to wear it. The negative level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by <a href="spelldisplay1364.html?ItemName=restoration">restoration</a> spells) while the armor is worn.

Worthiness


Task To be worthy of this relic, you must earn <a href="deitydisplay813c.html?ItemName=Iomedae">Iomedae's</a> blessing by performing a miraculous act of heroic righteousness worthy of inclusion among the Acts of Iomedae, as determined by the GM, and you must perform this act while wearing the relic.

Benefit The armor's enhancement bonus increases to +3, it gains the <a href="magicarmordisplay6bdc.html?ItemName=Determination">determination</a> armor special ability, and it gains the <a href="magicarmordisplayd4a7.html?ItemName=Defiant">defiant</a> armor special ability against evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead. In addition, the number of points in the relic's reservoir increases to 3, and the wearer can spend 1 point as a standard action to transform into a <a href="monsterdisplay238b.html?ItemName=Dire%20Lion%20(Spotted%20Lion)">dire lion</a>, as <a href="spelldisplayecf3.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20II">beast shape II</a>. This is a spell-like ability that uses the armor's caster level.
