This crude length of chain ends with a manacle that has been converted into a combination buckle and handle. The chain bristles with jagged points that are almost invisible to the naked eye.

This versatile length of chain can be worn around the chest like a sash or wielded in one hand like a weapon. As a weapon, the relic functions as either a +1 scorpion whip or a +1 spiked chain (wielder's choice). Switching between these configurations is a swift action. Whenever the wielder stows Jalnesin's Broken Bonds, she can stow the weapon normally or wear it across her chest, where it occupies her chest magic item slot. When worn in the chest magic item slot, the enhancement bonus and any weapon special abilities from Jalnesin's Broken Bonds apply to its wearer's unarmed strikes.

Worthiness


Task To be worthy of this relic, you must free at least a dozen enslaved or unjustly imprisoned innocents. For the purpose of this task, an innocent is any creature who was imprisoned without due process or whom you have proven innocent of any crime. You are not worthy of this relic if you complete this task by orchestrating events that lead to this situation, as determined by the GM.

Benefit The weapon gains the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay86e5.html?ItemName=Holy">holy</a> weapon special ability. Three times per day, the wielder can reshape Jalnesin's Broken Bonds into a piece of ammunition, functioning as a <a href="spelldisplayd7ef.html?ItemName=handy%20grapnel">handy grapnel</a> spell (CL 5th). While embedded into an object in this manner, Jalnesin's Broken Bonds extends into a 75-foot length of chain that can extend and retract as described for handy grapnel. Jalnesin's Broken Bonds transforms back into a weapon if it takes more than 25 hit points of damage or is removed from the embedded surface by its wielder as a standard action.
