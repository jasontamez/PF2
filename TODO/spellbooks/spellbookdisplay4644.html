This quartet of books is held together by a shining silver strand wound around the four tomes and tied in an intricate knot. Inside, the writing is expansive and sloppy, filled with marginalia; the author's notes indicate clear excitement about her discoveries, and while the thinker is obviously brilliant, she is also apparently undisciplined.
Value 16,435 gp (20,710 gp with the preparation ritual)
