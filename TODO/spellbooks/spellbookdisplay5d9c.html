These four cloth-bound books are neatly printed-as with a printing press or some other form of mechanical transcription-with a title page, a table of contents, and a useful cross-referenced index. They have been treated well and are clearly reference works, rather than laboratory notes; the writer was obviously a most disciplined and focused inventor.
Protection The cover is treated with tears of death poison (contact; save Fort DC 22; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1d6 Con damage and paralyzed for 1 minute).
Value 6,615 gp (11,115 gp with the preparation ritual)

Ritual

Spontaneous Bomb (Su) When it comes to bombs, you have a special trick up your sleeve. Once per day as a swift action, you can apply a discovery that you qualify for (but do not already know) to a bomb. This does not allow you to stack non-stacking discoveries on a bomb.
