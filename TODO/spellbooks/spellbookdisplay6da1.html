Arctic Call (Spellbook, Level 11 Evoker)

Fine vellum sheets fill these two well-worn books. Beautiful illustrations depict the effects of each spell, many with a distinctly arctic theme. Though the pages and their wintry illustrations are of high quality, the protective leather case that encloses both books smells and feels greasy, as if the hide has been crudely waterproofed with animal fat.
Opposition Illusion, necromancy
Protection fire trap modified to inflict cold damage (Reflex DC 17)
Value 4,335 gp (5,985 gp with the preparation ritual)

Ritual

Rime Bite (Su) You infuse your spell with a biting cold that few can withstand. Spend this boon as a free action when you cast a spell with the cold descriptor. Any damage from that spell ignores all resistance to cold, but does not ignore immunity to cold.
