Ritual

Secrets of Jatembe (Su) This edition of the Wisdom of Jatembe includes a number of unique rituals and philosophical notes supposedly written by the Old-Mage himself. These secrets allow you to prepare one of the following spells as an arcane spell 1 level higher than its druid spell level: barkskin, call lightning, cyclic reincarnation, entangle, forest friend, lesser restoration, plant growth, speak with animals, and speak with plants. At the GM's discretion, additional spells of 6th level or lower from the druid spell list may be available through the preparation rituals of specific copies of this book (which increases the spellbook's price by twice the cost of adding a wizard spell of the same level to the spellbook).
