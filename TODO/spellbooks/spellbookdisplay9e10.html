Quest Eternal (Spellbook, Level 13 Diviner)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 124</a>
Stuffed between the pages of these two well-worn volumes are all manner of riddles, tidbits of lore, and fragments of maps. One of the covers is missing a corner, as if hacked off with a blade, and the text inside is tiny and cramped, as if the author were afraid of running out of room.
Opposition Conjuration, transmutation
Value 6,475 gp (8,395 gp with the preparation ritual)

Ritual

Travel Sage (Su) There is nothing like a magic book to enhance the memory. Unlike other boons, you do not spend this one. Until you prepare spells again, you are considered trained in Knowledge (geography). If you are already trained in Knowledge (geography), you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on those checks instead.
