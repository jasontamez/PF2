This medium-sized book has a creased spine and supple gray leather covers. The leather has rubbed away in certain spots, tiny pinhole burns pock the surface, and a brass lock holds the book shut. A woman's portrait has been bound into the front cover, and text covers almost all of the image except her face: text in circles, with arrows pointing to new circles with suppositions. Underneath the woman's chin are the words "Diabolist sacrifice?"
Opposition Illusion, transmutation
Protection Average lock (DC 25), and the 5th-level spells are hidden with secret page. The special word is "reveal."
Value 2,195 gp (3,320 gp with the preparation ritual)
