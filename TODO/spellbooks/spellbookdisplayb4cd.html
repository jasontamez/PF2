The leather wrapping of this book is of an indeterminate type, and gives off a faint and unpleasant scent, as of charred meat. The writing inside is in a jagged hand, and many notes on the ash-smudged pages indicate its previous owner sought ever more damaging magic. A glittering rune in the cover's center is shaped vaguely like a lightning bolt.
Opposition Divination, transmutation
Protection Average lock (DC 25)
Value 535 gp (900 gp with the preparation ritual)

Ritual

Harmful Surge (Su) You can maximize a spell, but doing so damages you. Spend this boon effect as a free action when you cast a wizard evocation spell. When you do, you can treat that spell as if it were cast with the Maximize Spell metamagic feat, but you take 1d4 points of damage ?? the level of the spell that you are maximizing. The damage you take cannot be reduced in any way.
