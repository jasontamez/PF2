Tactics

Before Combat The fighter uses her scrolls of bear's endurance, bull's strength, fly, and heroism.
During Combat The fighter uses scorching ray and lightning bolt to soften up targets, then moves in with her bastard sword, using her first attack to disarm. If facing a spellcaster, she uses a scroll of silence. If she disarms a particularly powerful weapon, she spends a round picking it up and stuffing it in her handy haversack.

Mixing martial prowess with magic support, arcane pretenders typically serve as guards for powerful casters. Other arcane pretenders become adventurers, sellswords, or explorers.

Flenta Casalina

Flenta always wanted to be a wizard. She studied, memorized, and practiced, but still can't cast spells. She has, however, discovered a knack for manipulating magic items. Flenta passes herself off as a fighter with sorcerous skills, pretending to be casting spells rather than activating magic items (a ruse that rarely fools those with knowledge of spellcasting). If confronted, she insists that she gets the job done regardless of her methods. Deep down, Flenta still hopes to someday unlock the magical potential she's sure she possesses, whatever it takes.

Combat Encounters: Flenta often attacks groups with arcane spellcasters just to see what magic they have.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Always searching for new magic secrets she can understand (or fake), Flenta strikes up conversations about magic, magic items, and their use with anyone who seems likely to know about such things.
