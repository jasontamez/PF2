Rival explorers compete against other adventurers, going after the same rewards.

Rhortia Mooldon

Since she was a teenager, Rhortia has traveled with dozens of adventuring groups. She signs up with whoever promises the most excitement or the most lucrative reward. Rhortia spies on adventurers while they prepare in town so she can beat them to a good haul.

Rhortia learned throat singing while on a lengthy campaign, and uses that talent to augment her bardic performances and fill her opponents with unease.

Combat Encounters: Rhortia sits back and observes the flow of battle (while bolstering her allies), then enters the fray with a perfectly timed attack.

Roleplaying Suggestions: She uses her hat of disguise to appear harmless, taking the guise of a fawning youth or inquisitive old person to gain information.
