This paladin's lifelong mission is to eradicate evil giants.

Neln Belgurorn

All gnomes have obsessions, but few are as grim as Neln's obsession to see the world rid of evil giants. Her interest in this goal is neither cheerful nor curious; she has simply seen far too many villages destroyed and lives ruined by giant attacks. She sees it as her sworn duty to hunt and kill these evil beings so they cannot murder or enslave anyone else. So single-minded is her quest against giants that other gnomes have joked she must have dwarven blood in her ancestry. Since she respects dwarven tenacity and toughness, she takes this as a compliment.

Combat Encounters: Neln is commonly in the company of dwarves who share her desire to see the destruction of giant strongholds, and neither she nor her allies let anyone stand in their way. She sees those who protect giants as being as culpable as giants themselves-perhaps even worse, as they should know better.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Often frowning and stoic, Neln is not like other gnomes. Her lust for life and its experiences is dampened by her bloody quest.
