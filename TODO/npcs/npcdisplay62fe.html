Tactics

Before Combat The wizard casts mage armor and protection from arrows. If she has an ally who attacks in melee, she casts protection from energy (electricity) on that ally to protect him from her lightning bolt spells; otherwise, she casts it on herself (warding against fire).
During Combat The wizard tries to catch multiple opponents with black tentacles, then follows up with a lightning bolt to hit as many targets as possible. She uses her imp to invisibly deliver shocking grasp and empowered shocking grasp.
Base Statistics Without mage armor, the wizard's statistics are AC 15, touch 15, flat-footed 12.

Zuket Amaral

Zuket is an unexceptional adventuring wizard with a loud, outgoing personality. She loves visiting new places and exploring, and isn't embarrassed to stare open-mouthed at wondrous cities or landmarks. She likes things that are big and loud, from thunderstorms to parades to monsters.

Combat Encounters: Zuket attacks the PCs to drive them away from a halfling village or a cache of noisy magic items she wants.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Zuket doesn't like bullies, and she might intervene on behalf of a PC, even without being asked, if she sees that the PC is in trouble and thinks he needs help.
