The cave wizard manipulates the energy of deep rock.

Caracheck the Caustic

Caracheck has always felt an affinity for earth, stone, gems, and digging. Uninterested in serving an earth deity or the druidic power of elemental earth, he wanted to bend living rock to his will and chose an arcane path. Now he uses his magic to locate the earth's treasures and scour away the worthless rock around them. If he can't easily reach a prized vein of ore or gems, he collapses the area around it, preventing others from reaching it and giving him time to improve his extraction skills.
