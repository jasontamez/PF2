Tactics

Before Combat The monk conceals her shuriken as the metal cymbals inside her tambourine, applying 2 doses of black adder venom or drow poison to the weapons before combat. She performs, bluffs, or connives her way to her target.
During Combat If the monk finds herself outnumbered, she uses flurry of blows with her poisoned shuriken. She shifts and feints through a melee. If her feint is successful, she trips that foe. Once the foe is on the ground, she slams down with a Stunning Fist. A poisonous performer does not hesitate to abandon combat if outmatched or seriously injured, drinking her potion of invisibility and fleeing the field to a place where she can drink a potion of disguise self, blend in, and disappear.

The poisonous performer is a member of a monastery that seeks enlightenment in the perfection of murder and assassination. Such monks are poison users and masters of disguise, and often greatly feared in the lands around their monasteries. They are sometimes hunted by monks from other monasteries who believe their grim rites are a perversion of proper monastic practices.

Natessa the Angel of Death

Natessa came to the monastery on the far island when she was a young woman. She told the monks she had accidently killed a man with her horse, and wondered why it made her feel complete, at one with all being. The monks ushered her in, and though she was older than the other pupils, they trained her in the discipline of holy killing. Since that day, she has risen in the ranks, and is now one the monastery's prized slayers. Few expect the pretty but forgettable girl with the youthful gait to be a seasoned and a brutal killer.

Combat Encounters: Most people don't know they are in combat with Natessa until they have poisoned shuriken sticking out of them. Natessa usually works alone, but has been known to bring support for a particularly well-guarded target. She has also been associated with a small number of adventuring parties, but typically under a false identity.

Roleplaying Suggestions: While she's hunting a mark, Natessa takes on the persona of a traveling tambourine player or a prostitute.
