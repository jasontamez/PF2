These brave warriors gain prestige within their tribes and clans by challenging and defeating enemy spellcasters.

Yallathoon

The daughter of a warrior who was branded as a coward and a traitor by his tribe, Yallathoon had to work hard to prove her worth to her people. The shame of her father's misdeeds spurred her on, and she quickly moved up the ranks of the warrior caste. But it wasn't until she defeated a powerful wizard who tried to subjugate her tribe that Yallathoon's calling manifested. Branded with the title "Mageslayer," Yallathoon is hailed as the savior of her tribe, and the sins of her father have been long forgotten.

Though she despises arcane spellcasters and is leery of any divine casters who aren't obviously servants of her tribe's favored deities, Yallathoon isn't blinded by her role or her pride. If offered the chance to ally with a caster against a greater foe, she takes it-though nominally only to show up the caster with her martial prowess.

Combat Encounters: Yallathoon typically runs into the fray with other members of her tribe, but quickly breaks off from the pack to confront enemy spellcasters-in single combat, if at all possible.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Yallathoon is focused and proud, and is used to being treated with respect. She quickly dismisses those who do not treat her thus, but happily shares stories of her exploits with those who do. Warriors who disdain obvious magic items earn her approval, while anyone who notes the magic on her spear receives a flinty glare.
