Tribal leaders use their abilities rather than brute strength to guide their tribes to victory.

Esaye Polbele

Using magnetism and skill at deception, Esaye wrested control of her tribe from the previous chieftain, and now leads her brainwashed people to what she considers glory.

Sowing lies about the former leader, Esaye introduced dissent among the elders and strongest warriors, making sure her predictions came true while the chief's plans fell flat or resulted in ruin. After one too many bad omens and failures, the tribe dragged away the previous chieftain and sacrificed him.

Esaye now controls her people totally, and they lavish her with gifts and adoration. The tribe wages war against their neighbors, and those who refuse to assimilate into the growing clan face total destruction.Many abandoned villages, burned and reeking of rot, now dot the surrounding lands.

Combat Encounters: Esaye travels with a retinue of warriors, and supports them with her spellcasting. Those under her command lay down their lives for their chieftain.

Roleplaying Suggestions: To keep in the good graces of the rest of the tribe, Esaye hires adventurers for missions the others find too distasteful or taboo.
