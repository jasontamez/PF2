The lucky mage uses her magic, innate talents and good fortune to survive incredible odds with barely a scratch. Rather than depend on this strange fortune, however, the lucky mage constantly strives to understand and harness her unique abilities.

Amaryllis Hollendock

Amaryllis, a relaxed and personable halfling, tries not to upset the apple cart too much, mainly because she doesn't like seeing other people get hurt. She trusts her powers to get her through danger alive, but carries a burden of guilt over friends she wasn't able to save. She hides this underneath a veneer of constant cheerfulness and good humor, and is fond of using her magic to delight others and make friends-though anyone who underestimates her because of her love of clowning and children may find themselves in desperate straits should they rile her anger.

Combat Encounters: Amaryllis might fight the PCs if she believes they are responsible for harming her friends or threatening a person or place she cares about. She has a strong sense of fairness, and may attack the PCs to right an affront against someone else. She is quick to jump to conclusions, but also quick to talk if the PCs try to explain themselves.

Roleplaying Encounters: Amaryllis can be recruited as an ally easily, especially if the PCs look like they can take care of themselves. The PCs may meet her in the midst of a deadly situation-an opportune meeting she sees as her luck delivering the right people at the right time.
