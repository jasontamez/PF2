A saintly knight accomplishes great acts with his indomitable spirit and martial prowess.

Tregor the Just

Tregor believes himself to be a good soul trapped in a body of filth. The half-orc hates his orc heritage, and though he does not know the circumstances of his birth-he was left on the doorstep of a temple-he doubts it was honorable. Raised by the temple priests, Tregor is the shining example of the paladin ideal, as perfect in discipline and purity as he is ugly in appearance. He constantly seeks to better himself and the world by performing heroic deeds, but though he is stalwart and true, his worldview can be aggravatingly black and white .

Combat Encounters: Tregor is usually encountered riding his horse, seeking those who need a champion. He questions everyone he meets on the road, and assures them that they have nothing to fear from him'so long as their spirits are pure.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Tregor tries to be honest, just, and hospitable, but has no tolerance for evil or cruelty, nor much of a sense of humor.
