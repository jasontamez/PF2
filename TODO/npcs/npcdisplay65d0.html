Tactics

Before Combat The rogue prefers to work from the shadows, manipulating events and people to do his bidding. If combat is needed, he always attacks from surprise, when his foes least expect it.
During Combat The rogue prefers to move up, strike suddenly, withdraw before his foes can respond, and use his hat of disguise to change his appearance once he's out of sight. He relies on his rogue talents to protect him.

The masked lord manipulates events from the shadows, using a thousand different names. He creates conspiracies and topples empires without anyone ever knowing his true identity.

Tadros the Hidden

Tadros is only comfortable when nobody knows he exists. His disguises have aliases and his aliases lead double lives. None of his contacts have any idea what he really looks like; they recognize him only by specific code words. In addition to taking on fictional identities, he pretends to be real people, creating no end of trouble.

Combat Encounters: In the unlikely event that the PCs face Tadros in direct combat, he almost certainly has an ace up his sleeve. The PCs may be fighting a simulacrum, or someone else disguised as one of Tadros's aliases, or (if he is desperate) his real self with a contingency plan to cover his resurrection.

Roleplaying Suggestions: With his connections, identities, and plans, Tadros can be almost anyone, even temporarily replacing one of the PCs for a period of time.
