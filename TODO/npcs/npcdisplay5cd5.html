Corwyn Klas

When between jobs, Corwyn faithfully maintains his clothes, armor, and weapons, but once hired, he stops keeping up his appearance and grows more disheveled as the days pass.

Corwyn fears the supernatural, and keeps a holy symbol with him at all times. He blows his wages on worthless talismans sold with promises to work against fiends and spirits.
