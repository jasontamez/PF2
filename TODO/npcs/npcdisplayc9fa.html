Special Abilities

Preklikin's Book of Cults This book contains notations of strange cult practices and disturbing rants about Great Old Ones and grants the cultist a +1 resistance bonus on Will saves while she carries it. She may hold the book in one hand to use it as a lesser extend metamagic rod, but only for conjuration spells that summon or call evil outsiders. (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Gods and Magic 59)

Stoic The cultist gains a +1 bonus on all saving throws against fear effects. If she successfully saves against any fear effect, she is immune to further fear effects from that source for 24 hours. (See page 289 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide.)

Those who watch the stars and delve into forgotten lore often uncover truths that should have remained hidden. Many are destroyed by what they find, but a few gain great power at the cost of their sanity. These mystics draw others to them through promises of secret knowledge, founding hidden cults that serve entities whose existence is an affront to reality itself. While the practices of any one of these cults in particular is likely isolated to certain regions of Golarion, those who venerate the Old Cults can be found hidden away in virtually any land, making their infiltration of society that much more insidious.
