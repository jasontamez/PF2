Tactics

Before Combat The barbarian drinks his potion of shield of faith if he has time.
During Combat The barbarian plunges into battle using Spring Attack. Once in position, he uses Whirlwind Attack with Lunge and Power Attack, alternating regular ranseur attacks with trip, disarm, or sunder maneuvers (the latter against targets far enough away that they cannot make attacks of opportunity). He exits and re-enters rage whenever necessary to reactivate once-per-rage powers like mighty swing and unexpected strike.

Refined reavers mix their savage fury with more refined and civilized weapon attacks and maneuvers, dipping in and out of rage when it suits their purpose. They often work well with groups of allies.
