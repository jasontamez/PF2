Dulg Goldeneyes

When living on the streets as a young orphan, Dulg was abducted by a cult of the god of murder, who originally planned on using him as a test subject for new poisons they were creating. Intrigued by the young half-orc's spirit, resilience, and intelligence, however, the cult decided to cultivate him instead. They groomed him as an unholy assassin, and the half-orc has been an unquestioning killer for the cult ever since. Truly enjoying his murderous trade, Dulg leaves a grim calling card with each kill. Once his victim is dead, Dulg gouges out the eyes and leaves two polished golden coins in the sockets.

Combat Encounters:If Dulg comes calling, it typically means his marks have somehow crossed his cult, but this is not always the case. Sometimes he murders just to hone his craft and increase his grim renown.

Roleplaying Suggestions:Often silent and sullen, Dulg tends to see people only as potential targets of his foul art. He takes few freelance assignments, doing so only if he believes it can enhance his already fearsome reputation.
