Paragons of swordplay, these master duelists constantly search for foes to defeat in order to enhance their already formidable reputations.

Dancer

No one knows Dancer's real name, and he has no intention of giving it. Some surmise from his foppish manners and arrogant attitude that he is the scion of some far-flung regent, but that guess is far from the mark.

Born in the slums, Dancer conned his way into aristocratic circles and learned swordplay from true masters of the art. He became a favored proxy for aristocrats not wanting to risk their lives when challenged to a duel, and killed innumerable nobles and their champions before growing full of himself and challenging one of the highest-ranking nobles personally. Rather than face him in the dueling circle, the noble sent a full legion of soldiers to kill the upstart, and Dancer barely escaped with his life.

Now, having discarded his given name, Dancer actively seeks out warriors with reputations for deft swordplay and finagles his way into challenging them. His sole purpose is to push himself to greater heights of prestige and skill.

Combat Encounters: Dancer always fights alone, trying to best powerful foes and groups to increase his reputation.

Roleplaying Suggestions: In social situations, Dancer plays the part of the flippant dandy, luring opponents into a false sense of security.
