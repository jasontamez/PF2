Boon A cultist can hide the PCs or others they designate within a secret cult sanctuary for up to 3 days. They could also plant false evidence implicating an NPC as a cult member.

Cultists are members of secret societies, meeting hooded and masked in dark masses and unspeakable, blasphemous rites. They gather the lay cult members and lead them in their maledictions, channeling for them the shadowed powers of the nether planes.

Cultists can be found leading small cult cells or congregations of a half-dozen farmers, shipmates, bloodthirsty cannibals, or even misguided acolytes (CR 5). A pair of cultists might lead a larger cult of nine doomsayers or initiates (CR 8).

Cultists might also serve as disciples of more powerful spellcasters. A pair of cultists can be acolytes of an evil medium (CR 6), three cultists might be apprenticed to a shaman (CR 7), four could follow a conjurist (CR 8), or up to a dozen cultists might follow a cult leader (CR 12).
