The mother of beasts serves the goddess of madness and monsters. She looks after horrible creatures and summons extraplanar beings to defend herself and her pets.

Empiri Chalemede

Empiri raises and nurtures hybrid monsters and aberrant mutations. Though she lacks the magic to create these oddities, she values anyone skilled at such things.

Combat Encounters: Empiri is most effective when she has monsters to protect her. Without allies, she uses summon monster spells to conjure guardians.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Empiri might ask the PCs to help her catch a predatory beast-though not to destroy it.
