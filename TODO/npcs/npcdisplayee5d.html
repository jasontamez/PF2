Masters are the undisputed champions of unarmed combat, able to focus their inner strength into a single devastating blow or a barrage of attacks that leave their enemies dazed and reeling. A master can be a unique arena champion or an emissary from a distant empire. Masters may travel with a cohort of 10 battle monks from their academy (CR 16).
