Boon A captain can arrange sea passage for PCs or cargo to any navigable destination, and can help PCs find directions to obscure destinations (+5 bonus on Knowledge [geography] or other related checks). Captains working for a larger group can also issue legal decrees in their name.

A captain is mistress of a ship at sea. She may be the legal authority and representative of her nation, company, faith, or faction, or she may be an independent captain owing allegiance to none and claiming no home but the sea itself. Captains may be used as pirates, admirals, or master merchants. A captain is usually accompanied by a first mate and a traveling merchant as quartermaster (CR 12).
