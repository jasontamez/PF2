Valendron Oparal

Valendron hails from an elven village in the high mountains. When he was an infant, he and his mother were caught outside in a storm and struck by a bolt of lightning. Though his mother died, he survived, and as a youth he began to develop arcane powers. He believes that storms and natural disasters eliminate the weak, allowing the strong to survive. He struck out on his own to find others like himself.

Combat Encounters: Valendron might join with air mephits, air elementals, or jann trying to open a portal to or increase the influence of the Plane of Air. He may share a lair with electricity-using creatures such as behirs, shocker lizards, or blue dragons.

Roleplaying Encounters: Valendron may be looking for survivors in a village or town wrecked by a powerful storm, or could instead be searching for magic items relating to air, weather, and electricity.
