Avem the Blade

A young tough trying to make a name for himself, Avem prefers robbery and burglary to outright murder-but isn't afraid to kill.

Combat Encounters: Avem might target a solitary PC in a dangerous part of town, or may be the leader of a gang of unskilled thugs.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Avem is skilled at many kinds of theft, and can be hired to commit petty larceny or create a distraction at reasonable rates.
