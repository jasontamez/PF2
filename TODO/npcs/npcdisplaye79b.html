These eldritch knights seek out evil spellcasters and dispense justice for their misdeeds.

Melkallan Truespell

Believing magic to be a gift from the gods, Melkallan hates to see it misused by the wicked and the power-hungry. He uses his magic to protect the innocent, and to stop evil spellcasters who would enslave and terrorize.

Combat Encounters: Preferring the company of paladins and the agents of good deities, Melkallan joins any crusade that promises to bring evil spellcasters to justice. While his heart is pure and his zealous fervor is admirable, the gnome unfortunately adheres to rather stringent beliefs regarding the acceptable use of magic, and may command those he deems "unworthy" to cease casting immediately or face the consequences. Parties using magic for anything less than a crusade on behalf of a righteous lord or the common people-perhaps using it for mundane adventuring, looting, mercenary work, and so on-all risk running afoul of his long-winded judgments (and long-handled warhammer).

Roleplaying Suggestions: Melkallan is friendly and helpful to all, especially common people, but becomes unyielding and focused when he encounters any form of injustice.
