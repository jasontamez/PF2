A shadow cleric strikes like death from the darkness.

Soufara Ebonwind

Soufara is a high priestess and assassin for the god of secrets and murder. Because her god wipes secrets from Soufara's mind once she no longer needs to know them, her memory is full of holes. Ordinary events that trigger faint echoes of lost memories can make her shake with fear or rage.

Combat Encounters: Soufara might direct a group of master assassins, dealing with spellcasters while her allies kill the rest.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Soufara might help PCs in exchange for magic that can heal her memory loss.
