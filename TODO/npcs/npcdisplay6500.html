Tactics

Before Combat The wizard casts mage armor, mind blank, misdirection, protection from energy (electricity, fire), resist energy (cold), and spell turning.
During Combat The wizard uses dominate monster, weird, and mass hold person to control enemies, plus incendiary cloud and horrid wilting if they resist enchantments. She uses polymorph any object to change the last survivor into a marionette for her collection.
Base Statistics Without mage armor, mind blank, misdirection, protection from energy, resist energy, and spell turning, the wizard's statistics are AC 20, touch 16, flat-footed 17; Defensive Abilities none; Immune none; Resist none.
