Special Abilities

Cold Flesh (Ex) A winter witch gains endure elements as a constant, spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. This replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.

Ice Magic When a winter witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A baroness cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor.

Winter witch baronesses are members of Irrisen's aristocracy who rule towns and villages throughout the nation. As a baroness (or sometimes countess depending on her rank), a winter witch reports to the ruler of her province. Some baronesses and countesses treat their subjects better than others, but across the board they are unsympathetic, short-tempered, and cruel.
