Atanya

Atanya is gruff but shrewd, more concerned about doing a good job than getting along with anyone. Secretly she hopes she has what it takes to be a hero and leader.

Combat Encounters: Atanya fires an arrow to wound a tough-looking PC, then demands surrender.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Atanya calls out a warning that the PCs are surrounded, hoping to bluff her way out of a lethal conflict.
