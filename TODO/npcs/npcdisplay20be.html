Tactics

Before Combat The arcane archer casts barkskin and uses her wand of shield. She prepares frost burst arrows using her enhance arrows ability.
During Combat Preferring to stay out of the reach and sight of powerful enemies, the arcane archer casts fly and greater invisibility on herself, takes flight, and pelts her enemies with arrows from relative safety.
Base Statistics Without barkskin, the arcane archer's statistics are AC 24, touch 17, flat-footed 19

Though these archers primarily hunt undead, they are dangerous foes for any creatures.

Sorina Kalthorin

Sorina believes undeath is a scourge and corruption that must be purged. As long as the undead spread their filth, all other moral questions are moot. She sees it as her sacred duty to destroy all undead she comes across. To this end, she is constantly in search of crypts and ruins that hide her hated foes.
