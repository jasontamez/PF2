These irreverent illusionists are the bane of humorless adventurers. Their tricks are sometimes mistaken for enemy attacks, and even in dangerous situations, their own amusement comes first.

Miet Silvervein

Miet is an artist who sculpts clay, light, and sound. She is fascinated with the play of light and shadow on physical things, and intensely studies people and objects in order to memorize and understand their shapes and surfaces. She claims that she can create a flawless illusion of anyone she has ever met and anything she has ever touched, and has used her talents for illusion to befuddle, entertain, and confound people for years. She doesn't let herself take anything seriously, even the destruction of her creations'she is comfortable with the ephemeral and impermanent visualizations of her mind's eye, and knows she can always recreate something that was lost.

Combat Encounters: Miet enjoys pranks and often doesn't know when she's pushed things too far. What is innocent play in her mind might be interpreted by the PCs as an attack from a hostile, unseen force.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Miet might volunteer to travel with the PCs (especially if they are famous) so she can study what they look like or examine strange new monsters.
