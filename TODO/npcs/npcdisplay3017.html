Boon A priest can accompany PCs or send a patrol of four temple guards to assist them for up to 3 days. She can also craft magical arms and armor at a 10% discount.

A priest is a leader within his church, spreading the faith by any means necessary, even through conversion at swordpoint when argument fails. A priest can be a crusader, warpriest, or divine champion. A priest might be advisor to a noble (CR 10), or travel with a retinue of a dozen temple guards (CR 10).
