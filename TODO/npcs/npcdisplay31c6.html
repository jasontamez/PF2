Street artists are active in urban politics, a little crazy, or both. Their art and messages delight some, but annoy landowners whose buildings become the artists' medium.

Telkineel "Alleycat" Orbast

This elf creates masterpieces across the city, painting them on walls and across cobblestone streets. He signs his pieces by painting a cat's paw instead of a name. Some call these works graffiti, and they rarely stay up for long.

Telkineel is also a skilled dancer and acrobat, able to contort into mind-boggling positions. He learned dances from dozens of cultures over the years. In one amazing feat, he dances on a rope tied between two streetlights. This performance garnered him his nickname, and fetches the most coin from audiences.

Combat Encounters: Telkineel is often assailed by guards who don't appreciate where he puts his art. He flees as soon as he can, rarely stopping to thank anyone who comes to his aid.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Cheerful and whimsical, Telkineel can also be skittish. He tends to talk in riddles which, if deciphered, reveal truths about the city and its denizens.
