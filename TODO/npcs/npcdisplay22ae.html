Nar Losafel

Nar is a troubled halfling whose innate magic has always caused inadvertent destruction in his home. He was born in a quiet halfling district of a human city, but his friends and family chased him out in his teen years, fearing for their safety. Forced to live like a hermit, Nar grew bitter and angry. His odd speech patterns and personality make him difficult to read.
