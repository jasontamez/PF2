Tactics

Before Combat The monk attempts to get close to an opponent through Bluff or Diplomacy, then drinks her potions of bear's endurance and bull's strength.
During Combat Against a single foe, the monk opens with Stunning Fist augmented with Improved Vital Strike, then tries to grapple the stunned foe. Against multiple opponents, she uses flurry of blows to attempt trip and disarm maneuvers, making as many foes prone or weaponless as possible, then strikes when those opponents provoke attacks of opportunity. Against foes too large to grapple or immune to stunning, she uses her ki pool to boost her movement, then Spring Attack with Improved Vital Strike to make hit and run attacks.
