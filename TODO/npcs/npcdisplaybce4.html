Con artists are never what they first appear to be. They hustle the gullible using confidence schemes.

Agail Enthess

Posing as a minor noble, "Lady Enthess" uses her assumed station in life to instill a sense of trust in her potential marks. Her apparent success and lavish lifestyle convince wealthy people of her success, leading them to invest in her various business ventures.

Lady Enthess sells counterfeits of relics supposedly discovered during a dangerous expedition. She keeps a few crates of these fakes in a hidden space in her basement. Through Enthess's adventuring business, investors fund her seemingly hazardous excursions. This tiered investment only ever pays out for Enthess herself.

Enthess also sells mining rights in the area. She purchases an old mine, supposedly played out decades ago, then sneaks in and seeds it with raw gems. She then hires a prospector to inspect the purchase. Once he returns with news of the great wealth, she sells the claim for much more than she originally paid.

Growing up on the streets, Enthess has defrauded hundreds of marks in her time. Though she enjoys bilking the clueless wealthy, she's not so noble as to leave the poor alone. It was among these people she was raised, and from them she learned some of the simplest frauds. One of her favorites when she was young was the glass drop: she would purposefully bump into someone on the street, drop a sack of already broken glass, claim the bag contained an expensive vase, and demand the mark pay for the damage. As she grew up and began adventuring, she expanded her swindles to a greater scale.

Combat Encounters: Unless supported by a group of bodyguards or shills, Agail stays out of combat-begging, cajoling, bribing, or bargaining when need be. If she is well supported, she provides aid (while invisible) before slipping away to continue her schemes and find a way to get revenge from a safe distance some other day.

Roleplaying Suggestions: "Lady Enthess" is always on the lookout for new marks. Through polite and often delightful in conversation, she measures each person she meets, trying to find just the right con to fit the person in question.
