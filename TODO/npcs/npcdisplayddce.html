Halfling slingers often patrol the areas surrounding halfling settlements. Sometimes they hire themselves out as scouts and skirmishers.

Tomin Blanderbass

The wanderer's life suits Tomin just fine. He roams from town to town looking for mercenary work, and is more than happy to take gold from anyone who offers. Tomin doesn't really care about right or wrong, just about getting paid. He's as likely to guard a caravan as to rob one. He draws the line at hurting those who won't fight back, believing that's what separates him from a petty thug.

When he first started adventuring, Tomin and his companions ran afoul of a band of elves on the hunt for bandits. The elves ran down and slew Tomin's companions one by one, then left him tied up and dangling from a tree as a warning for others. That humiliation still burns in Tomin's belly, and he fears and detests elves to this day.

Combat Encounters: Tomin targets enemy elves first, and often refuses to treat with allies who have elves within their midst.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Tomin is not shy when looking for work-or when he wants to pick a fight with an elf.
