The giant-killer is trained to kill monsters many times her size, using speed, specialized weapons, and time honored techniques to bring down even the most daunting foes.

Mirshi Knee-Splitter

Feisty and fearless, Mirshi is good at slaying giants-and she makes sure that everyone else knows it. If a town is menaced by her favored prey, she swaggers in and demands an outrageous price for her services. Once the townsfolk agree, she murders the giants, claims her wages, and leaves the town impoverished. She's been fighting giants since she came of age, and she wants to collect at least one head from each type of giant to display in her trophy room.

Combat Encounters: Mirshi might attack the PCs to prevent them from stealing her glory or depriving her of a bounty from a nearby village. If giants are involved in a fight, she fights them no matter how much she might despise the other combatants involved. When she misses in combat against a Medium or Small creature, she claims it's because she's so used to fighting much larger opponents (mostly just to protect her pride).

Roleplaying Suggestions: Mirshi loves it when others laud her achievements. She quickly becomes friendly toward a bard PC if she thinks the bard might write ballads, songs, epic poems, or plays about her giant-slaying adventures. The tales Mirshiri tells about herself are highly exaggerated, but she never lies when counting up the number of giants that she's killed.
