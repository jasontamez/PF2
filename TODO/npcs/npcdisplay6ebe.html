The blade lord has attained mastery with swords by forsaking all other weapons.

Yalandara

Yalandara has spent her long elven life perfecting the use of longswords, short swords, and rapiers. She has not even touched another kind of weapon in more than a hundred years, as she feels such things are beneath her. If her survival depends on using something other than a sword, she does what she must, but vents her rage on those around her.

Combat Encounters: Yalandara knows she doesn't have to prove her skill, but likes to teach upstarts a lesson, and might duel a martial character for fun.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Yalandara respects others who uses swords with skill, and may aid them in tasks that don't inconvenience her. The PCs might encounter her practicing swordplay in some extreme environment chosen to test her balance and concentration.
