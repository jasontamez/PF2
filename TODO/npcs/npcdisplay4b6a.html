Blarta

Blarta is a bully, and prefers intimidation to fighting, since it requires less work from him.

Combat Encounters: Blarta might harass the PCs on the road or scout for bandits.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Blarta sees a lot of people on the road, and may know things of interest to the PCs. For the right price, he might even be persuaded to join them, though he's unreliable at best.
