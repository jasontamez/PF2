Many failed disciples wander the land purely to prove their martial prowess. Others latch on to evil cults, dealing death for a dark god.

Urguk the Chosen

As a child, a cult of apocalyptic monks kidnapped Urguk to raise him as a champion of their order. Their teachings of violence and scorn for life took hold, but their attempts to install obedience and inner discipline did not. Urguk mastered many of their techniques, but never in a fashion that pleased them. Frustrated by his failures and unwilling to let Urguk leave with intimate knowledge of their order, the monks decided to terminate their experiment.

Urguk had learned their lessons better than he knew. He killed the monks sent to murder him and fled into the night.
