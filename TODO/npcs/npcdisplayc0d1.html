This wise woman knows many natural remedies for wounds and ailments, and supports this knowledge with a strange mix of spells, scrolls, and potions. She is midwife to many women, assists in the delivery of livestock, and is trusted for her ability to predict storms and droughts. The healer has a kind heart and hates to see any creature suffer. She is usually able to find alternative ways for poor folk to pay for her services, and as a result is beloved by her community. Once she is provided with sufficient food, water, and household supplies for her needs, she often directs payments above and beyond that to other needy people in the vicinity, creating a web of trust and reliance among the townsfolk or villagers.

If she helps adventurers with a curse, disease, or terrible injury, she is likely to ask them to build a stone wall, repair a house, or tend to a farmer's livestock in payment. This is the case even if there is a remote threat of monsters nearby, for she understands that the adventurers were likely to chase down that threat anyway, and therefore would be getting a service for free. She believes in generosity and altruism, but likes it when people remain humble and are willing to get their hands dirty doing "real work" that lacks the "glory" of bloodshed.

Many of her supplies were acquired from years of negotiating and trading, whether directly for the items (such as her wand of cure light wounds) or for rare or exotic materials she can use to make potions and scrolls. If adventurers wish to pay her in the form of these goods (or by questing for them) or offer her minor healing items the adventurers have outgrown but that would still be useful for helping villagers, she gratefully accepts.

The healer is especially interested in acquiring potions of cure light wounds, as she is not particularly fast on her feet (and is getting slower as the years pass), nor is she a skilled rider, so being able to hand a healing potion (which even a non-spellcaster can administer) to a fast rider or runner might make the difference between life and death for an injured farmer or rancher.
