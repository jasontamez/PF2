Boon Bandit lords can grant safe passage from bandit attacks for the PCs and their allies for up to 3 days. They can also arrange the purchase or sale of goods as if the gp limit was for a community one size larger.

Bandit lords are the daring masterminds of entire gangs of bandits, often ruling over camps in the centers of trackless woods or the equally trackless warrens of a slum or sewer inside a great city. Some hide their identity behind disguises or a nom de guerre, while others strive for fame or infamy. Bandit lords can be used as assassins, duelists, or royal swordmasters. Bandit lords may have a pair of sellswords as bodyguards and sparring partners (CR 12), or may travel with a battle mage, sellsword, and a gang of eight bandits (CR 12).
