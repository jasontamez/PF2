The wrath priest serves the primordial god of disaster and destruction, striking down innocents and enemies with fire, blade, and hatred. He is a quintessential nihilist, and can not be bought or reasoned with except as it furthers his god's horrific ends.

Aznek

Aznek is cruel, violent, and destructive-a childhood bully given profane magic and physical might. He loves the screams of his victims, and smashes beautiful things for the fun of it. He likes having strong minions, and encourages them to challenge him for dominance, though none has succeeded. He lets these would-be rivals live, albeit with broken arms or legs as reminders of their failure.

Combat Encounters: Aznek makes a good solo encounter, boss of a group of raiders (especially orcs), or minion of a strong leader or powerful warbeast.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Aznek's nature makes it difficult to interact with him except as his servant.
