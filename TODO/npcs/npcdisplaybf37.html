Before Combat The fighter drinks his potions of barkskin and bear's endurance.
During Combat The fighter cows his foes with Dazzling Display. He goes after shaken enemies first, especially humans. He uses his first attack each round for a trip attempt. If hard pressed, the fighter uses Combat Expertise to improve his Armor Class and positions himself for a leaping escape into the nearest body of water. He likes to take out healers and support first.

Serving as the captains of pirate ships or the commandants of pirate fleets, pirate kings command those pressed into their service with ruthless efficiency.

Dalithan of the Black Hand

No dashing swashbuckler, Dalithan might best be described as a dastard in search of a crime. He leads his fleet on pirate raids by land and sea; hires his ships out for mercenary contracts; and dabbles in assassination, extortion, ransom, and smuggling as well. The warrants that authorities and victims try to put out for his death go unsigned thanks to a few well-placed bribes. Though he's widely regarded as a cold-hearted villain, his crewmates know the captain has a peculiar fondness for seals, often ordering meat'such as prisoners-chopped up and thrown overboard for them.
