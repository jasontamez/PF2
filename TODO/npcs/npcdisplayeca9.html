Milanet Rutteppi

Milanet's fun begins when another's ends. She ruins lives by spreading gossip and lies about rivals to damage their reputations. By being outwardly friendly, she keeps targets from knowing they're on her list until they hear these tall tales.

A celebrity, Milanet performs in plays and poetry events.

Combat Encounters: Milanet keeps foes off guard while her allies wreak devastation. When alone, she creates chaos and slips away so she'll live to fight again.

Roleplaying Suggestions: In person, Milanet is always charming and entertaining, but keeps mentally sizing up those she interacts with for details and stories she can twist into nasty rumors.
