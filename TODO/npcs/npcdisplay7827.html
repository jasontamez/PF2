Boon A wanderer can smuggle an item or person into or out of a guarded city or encampment in their wagons or as part of their troupe.

A wanderer is a member of a band of traveling folk who ply the back roads and alleys of more settled lands, often chased by rumors of thievery or kidnapping, mending pots and knives and giving exotic performances that arouse the ire of the staid.

Wanderers are often excellent entertainers, whether musicians, dancers, or actors, but can also serve as exotic cutpurses and charlatans.

Wanderers often travel in troupes of four entertainers (CR 6), or in larger groups of a dozen or more (CR 9+). A lone wanderer might accompany a vagabond (CR 4) or hedge wizard (CR 5), while a troupe of five or six might work with a fortune teller (CR 8) or highwayman (CR 9).
