Tactics

Before Combat The barbarian uses stealth and deception to get close to enemies without them noticing, and uses his chime of opening to break into locked strongholds.
During Combat The barbarian tries to disarm opponents at the beginning of combat, using poison against a target's weakest ability score if he knows his target in advance. He triggers his mighty swing on a sword critical that might slay his target, and uses his rage-enhanced senses to find creatures trying to hide or flee. He uses his buckler when faced with many foes, but against lone targets uses his nine lives stealer for two-handed Power Attacks.

Xavier Durant

Xavier fancies himself a master of infiltration, and takes special delight in eliminating rival assassins.

Combat Encounters: Xavier often hires goons to weaken his prey before moving in for the kill.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Xavier disguises himself so he can interact with marks in person and learn about them.
