Elizaveta Oriones

Trained by a church, Elizaveta sees killing demons and devils as a sacred duty. In villages plagued by fiends, she questions locals to determine what kind of threat she faces. If foolish dabblers called the fiends, she turns them in. If the summoning was deliberate, she kills those who were responsible.

Combat Encounters:Eliza might confront the PCs if she hears rumors that one is a conjurer or summoner.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Eliza volunteers her help only if PCs are hunting demons, devils, or fiendish cults.
