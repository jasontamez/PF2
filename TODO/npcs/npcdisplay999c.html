Dorremera Salin

Dorremera is a child of the waves, sired by an aquatic elf who abandoned her human mother. Raised along the sea, Dorremera took to the water as if born to it, and considers the beasts of the sea and shore her kin. She has little patience for the niceties of society-whether human or elven-and lashes out at almost everyone who crosses her path.

Combat Encounters: Dorremera has no compunctions about stealing from landlubbers, or killing those who chase or surprise her.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Though it is hard to get through to her, Dorremera sometimes parleys with adventuring groups that treat her respectfully, show great battle prowess, or are particularly kind to sea creatures.
