Boon An archaeologist can tell PCs secrets of ruins and relics of a specific ancient culture, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise, Spellcraft, and Use Magic Device checks to identify items relating to that culture, as well as Knowledge (engineering), Perception, and Disable Device checks when dealing with traps or secret doors in a ruin from that culture.

An archaeologist is a cunning scholar and explorer of ancient texts and ruins. She is knowledgeable in a wide range of fields, as quick with a quip or quotation as with a blade, bolt, or lash. An archaeologist might partner with a medium to placate the spirits of the dead disturbed in her explorations (CR 7), or supply a traveling merchant with exotic relics (CR 8).
