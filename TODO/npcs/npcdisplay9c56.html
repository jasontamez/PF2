Mediums prey on those who have lost loved ones, or sentimental souls who wish to contact the great beyond.

Halbert Nerik

Strange trinkets make this charlatan's house a museum of the macabre. During his seances, he uses both spells and mundane set-ups to make it appear as though spirits were present. Though he has no true power over spirits, Halbert plays the part of a supernatural conduit well.

Halbert chooses victims, researches them, and preys on their grief. Appearing as the lost loved one, he gains the trust of wealthy clients by repeating accurate information he researched. Once they trust him, he begins claiming the spirits want them to bestow lavish gifts upon him.

Combat Encounters: Some patrons respond violently when duped. Halbert retains sellswords to subdue them.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Halbert acts considerate, but cares only about separating suckers from their coin.
