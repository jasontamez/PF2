Spellswords make dangerous music with a mixture of swordplay and spellcasting.

Palos Kendrosi

Trained exclusively at a prestigious elven academy, Palos learned a dual regimen of swordplay and magic. He trained for decades before venturing away from the alabaster spires and towering pines of his homeland.

To Palos, every adventure and every battle is a puzzle to solve with a combination of wit, might, and magic. Nearing his 200th year, he feels he is finally coming into his own.

Combat Encounters: Palos enters into a battle with the discipline and curiosity that befit a scholar, learning from each thrust, parry, and spell cast-and teaching a lesson to those who dare stand against him. He often surrounds himself with other adventurers; sometimes it's because he believes in their goals, and other times just for the chance to learn new tactics in battle.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Sometimes seeming aloof and distant, Palos is often on the lookout for new adventures and groups he can learn from. Other times, he might pursue a mission for a master or a cause.
