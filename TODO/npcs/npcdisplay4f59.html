Chameleons are more comfortable portraying other people than appearing in their own natural forms.

Arweena Melkoreth

Always shy and nervous about her bestial appearance when she was a child, Arweena experimented with hundreds of kinds of makeup and assorted treatments to change her appearance-with varying degrees of success. A bleaching attempt with dangerous chemicals left her scarred, and her eyebrows and body hair never grew back. Arweena began learning arcane arts, using illusions to mask her true appearance. Finding it easy to fool people, Arweena began taking others' identities. Now only a core of her old self exists, her mind filled with hundreds of personalities and illusory costumes. She constantly asks, "Who am I now?" Arweena became an actor, and found fame as a handful of starlet sensations. Few know these multiple celebrities are all one woman.

Combat Encounters: Arweena hires out her talent for minor cons and opportune larcenies in order to increase her wealth.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Arweena's talent for acting and need to become someone else make each interaction different. Even her few close friends have a hard time determining her true personality.
