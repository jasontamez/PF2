This half-orc barbarian savagely rips though weaker opponents with unquenchable bloodlust.

Graun Quor

Graun the pit fighter was raised in lawless borderlands where control changed hands frequently and unpredictably. The one constant was the thirst for blood sports, and any youth with a hard edge and more greed and ambition than fear could make a name and a fortune so long as he survived. Graun mastered many weapons throughout his career, but loves best the orc double axe he took as a prize in an early championship bout. Having long since bought his freedom, Graun wanders the borderlands selling his skills to the highest bidder. A few orc tribes have offered Graun leadership roles, but he has little patience for such things and cares nothing for the welfare of his allies.

Combat Encounters: Graun can be found at the head of an orc band on rare occasions, either a tribe he has adopted for a short time or who serve as fodder for his hunts. Other times he stalks the wild lands looking for opponents worthy of his fighting skills.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Graun sometimes ventures into civilized lands to spend his coin and search for blood sports, hoping for a chance to kill in front of a crowd.
