The vivisectionist cleric serves the god of pain and darkness, and can keep victims alive for weeks.

Melisai Hesani

Melisai is personable despite her arrogance, and considers herself a surgeon and a sculptor. When not adventuring, she works with poorhouse medics, embalmers preparing bodies, and torturers-anyone who gives her the opportunity to experiment. She prefers the company of like-minded adventurers, but if none are available, she animates zombies.

Combat Encounters: Melisai is useful as an enemy leader, member of a rival adventuring party, or servant of an important NPC or villain.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Though evil and disturbing, Melisai is easy to get along with. She is forthright, and has no problem helping the PCs if it achieves her own ends.
