Tactics

Before Combat The monk uses Stealth to find a hiding spot in an effort to gain the element of surprise.
During Combat The monk uses Deflect Arrows to close in on ranged combatants. He uses Lunge to keep enemies at bay and flurry of blows to trip multiple opponents if surrounded, allowing him the full benefit of his Combat Reflexes when tripped opponents try to stand. A swift brawler uses Power Attack against enemies he has tripped or stunned, only risking the penalty on his attack rolls when his target's AC has been compromised in some way.

Swift brawlers serve as the vanguard of many monasteries' forces. They use speed and agility to track down and neutralize enemy leaders and spellcasters.

Ryoto

Once Ryoto was a gambler, a killer, and a thief. And then one day he walked away from that life-a depraved and wine-hazed existence of vice and violence. He sat down before the gates of a monastery high up in the hills, and did not move for over a week, meditating without food or water. When he finally spoke, he looked up at the monks of the order and merely said, "I am now you." The monks, sensing the fundamental truth in this cryptic statement, silently opened their doors and accepted him as one of their own.

When he came to the monastery, Ryoto was powerful and crafty, but undisciplined. The monks saw his potential, however, and did their best to break him down and remake him into a perfect warrior. After years of routine and training, he is now one of the greatest fighters in the school, and is revered and thought of as a great teacher, despite-or perhaps because of-the fact that he has not said a single word since entering the monastery.

Combat Encounters: Ryoto is the first one to come to the defense of his order, or to right some wrong he sees.

Roleplaying Suggestions: As someone who refuses to speak, or sometimes even to acknowledge the existence of others, Ryoto is difficult for others to communicate with. His companions often don't know his intent until he acts.
