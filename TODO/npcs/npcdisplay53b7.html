A master spy lingers in the shadows or at parties, where he can easily misdirect people.

Marlit Telamin

Trained in the greatest academies of the world and raised by one of the most ruthless crime families, this diplomat works for five different countries and interests. He weaves complex plots, while always leaving clues that point to someone other than himself. If one crime family knew Marlit (in one of his numerous aliases) was also working for a rival nation, they would hunt him down and behead him for treason.

Combat Encounters: Marlit assassinates undefended targets, and fights to survive when caught.

Roleplaying Suggestions: With his athletic build and knowledge of strategy, Marlit masquerades as a military man.
