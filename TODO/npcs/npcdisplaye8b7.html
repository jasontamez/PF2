Citadel Vraid is a hostile place for virtually anyone but the
Hellknights who rule it. Since armigers make up the bulk
of Citadel Vraid's denizens, intruders often encounter these
rookie Hellknights before rousing the attention of higherups.
Most armigers have up to 4 or 5 class levels in fighter
or ranger, though some pupils have backgrounds as cavaliers
or even rogues. Citadel Vraid's Hellknights and signifers
are significantly more challenging than their greener
associates, and possess at least 1 level in either the Hellknight
or Hellknight Signifer prestige class (see Pathfinder Campaign
Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide and Pathfinder Campaign
Setting: Paths of Prestige, respectively). The following is an
example of a typical Signifer of the Nail from Citadel Vraid.
