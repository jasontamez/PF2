Boon A first mate can arrange for PCs to meet with a captain or merchant prince of their acquaintance, with a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks because of the first mate's reputation. He can also accompany PCs with a longboat and crew of four shipmates for up to 1 day.

A first mate is the loyal assistant to a ship's captain. He oversees duties and discipline aboard ship, feared but always respected; he is able to entertain with a sea shanty one moment and ply his trusty lash or flashing cutlasses the next. A first mate could also be the warden of an exotic island prison. Away from their ships, first mates can be found with a traveling merchant quartermaster (CR 9), or a captain (CR 12).
