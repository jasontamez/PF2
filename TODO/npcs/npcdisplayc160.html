Before Combat The fighter drinks her potions of bear's endurance and heroism.

She saves her shield's bite attack for prone enemies and other easy targets.

Serving as a leader to orcs, half-orcs, or other barbaric forces, the brutal warlord uses her martial control to shape the battlefield.

Livia Coldheart

Livia was born and raised in human society. Mocked and tormented for her bestial appearance, she grew to resent her human blood and the intolerant society it represented. As an adult, she met her first orcs only to find they too saw her as sullied by her half-breed heritage. But there was a difference: When she kicked in humans' teeth, they called her a monster. When she bashed in orcs' skulls, the rest cheered her on.

Livia roams the outskirts of orc lands, melding small tribes into her larger band through raw force and primal magnetism. She handpicks her lieutenants from the most disciplined orcs, and has slowly transformed her horde from a disorganized rabble into a semblance of an disciplined army. She dreams that, in time, she will rule an empire of orcs and half-orcs.
