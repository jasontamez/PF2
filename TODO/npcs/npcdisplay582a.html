The pirate queen is a deadly foe, whether she's encountered in a scummy port town or out on the high seas, flying the black flag. She keeps a full crew of unruly, vicious buccaneers in line, and rewards them with the treasure and carnage they crave.

Pialoosa

Cocky and self-assured from years of experience on the water, Pialoosa expects nothing but the best from her crew, and rewards them generously when they show great bravery or skill. She is especially greedy-even for a pirate-and pursues any rumors, maps, or historical fables that might lead to treasure hoards hidden by long-dead pirates.

Combat Encounters: Pialoosa pursues a ship the PCs are on, demanding they surrender their treasure or be tossed in the briny deep. If encountered on land, she might start a massive brawl in a tavern, possibly after playing a game of cards and losing a good share of the booty she acquired most recently.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Pialoosa could be hired as a trustworthy (if black-hearted) ship captain to guide the PCs through dangerous waters. She relies on her reputation to keep other pirates away, and flies a special red flag with a black image of a foot on it to indicate she's aboard a ship. Anyone who attacks her ship risks death beneath her blade, even if it's an old friend.
