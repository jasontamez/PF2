Special Abilities

Anonymity (Ex) The Gray Gardener receives a morale bonus equal to her class level on Bluff and Disguise checks made to conceal her identity.

Dramatic Interrogation (Ex) If the Gray Gardener threatens a helpless creature, she gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform checks to influence creatures that have a starting attitude of hostile, unfriendly, friendly, or helpful toward the helpless creature, include the helpless creature itself.

Harsh Judgment (Su) This functions as the inquisitor's judgment ability, but can only be used to choose the destruction, piercing, purity, and smiting judgments. When using harsh judgment, the Gray Gardener is considered an 8th-level inquisitor for the purpose of determining the bonuses granted by the judgment.

The notorious executioners of Galt, the Gray Gardeners root out their nation's enemies-whether actual or simply perceived- and ensure that their soul-imprisoning guillotines, the final blades, remain slaked in blood.
