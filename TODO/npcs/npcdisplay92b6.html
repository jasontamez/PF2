Tactics

Before Combat The rogue drinks a potion of resist energy if he expects his target to use energy attacks and uses shield on himself.
During Combat The rogue uses Sickening Critical or Intimidate to hinder opponents so he can use Shatter Defenses to sneak attack them. If the opponent has magical protections, the rogue uses the dispelling attack rogue talent to break those defenses.

The mage slayer is trained and equipped to murder arcane spellcasters. Each one has some minor magical training, either from a church or arcane study.

Skanrak

Skanrak was raised by a cult of religious zealots who believe arcane magic is a profane offense to the gods. He hates all arcane spellcasters with a passion, no matter what their class is, whether their magic is trained or natural, or toward what ends the magic is used. His hatred includes monsters that use arcane magic, such as nagas and dragons, and especially those that use magic to bypass the natural laws of death by becoming undead. He is very knowledgeable about arcane magic, recognizing signs of magic and quickly identifying a caster's class, bloodline, or favored school. He knows that a split-second hesitation could cost him his life, so he never makes witty chatter during a fight, instead going about his business with a grim and brutal efficiency.

Combat Encounters: Skanrak often works alone, targeting vulnerable individuals (like a solitary wizard crafting a magic item) who he can then isolate and attack. He might ally with priests of his cult, especially if they can ward him against hostile magic (such as with death ward, spell immunity, and spell resistance). He has no particular hatred for nonmagical creatures, but never gives more than one warning to stay out of his way, and frequently waives that warning if it's clear someone intends to stop him.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Skanrak may agree to a truce with a magic-wielding PC in exchange for help killing a dangerous opponent he cannot defeat alone, but the truce expires as soon as his objective is met.
