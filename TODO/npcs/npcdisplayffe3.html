Special Abilities

Constructed (Ex) For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count as both humanoids and constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear effects and all emotion-based effects.

Emotionless (Ex) Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4 penalty on Sense Motive checks.

Nanite Surge (Ex) An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate action, an android can cause her nanites to surge, granting a bonus equal to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent in illumination to that of a torch for 1 round.

Across Numeria and beyond, wandering androids train themselves to be paragons of perfection. Not all androids choose this path'some study the intricacies of magic and others master weapons of war-but those most interested in finding their true selves in this confusing world follow the path of the monk.

Though most androids realize they are born of strange technology, few recall their birth into the world. They seek a better connection to themselves, and thus they eschew all technology and rely only on their own bodies and abilities to find their place in the world. These androids train their bodies and minds to forge themselves into weapons, and they rely on their training more than they make use of their nanite surge ability. They study the physical form of opponents and focus their attacks on the weak areas, grappling combatants and wrenching their limbs in ways calculated to break bone and inflict excruciating pain. Though many Numerian ascetics seek a path of enlightenment, they remain dangerous adversaries to those they cross in the barbaric lands of Numeria-especially the tyrants of the Technic League.
