Sindriza

Sindriza was born to a shaman in an efreet-worshiping orc tribe. Her magic manifested early, burning anyone who tried to harm her and keeping her warm when the chief tried to abandon her to die in the cold. She embraced her tribe's love of violence and fire, and loves to use her powers to maim, torture, and kill. She believes she is blessed by the fire gods and meant to use her magic to conquer and destroy. She is a pyromaniac, and has difficulty resisting her urge to ignite flammable objects, creatures, and buildings.

Combat Encounters: Sindriza readily allies with bandits, raiders, or mercenaries, especially if they are prone to needless violence and arson. She may lead a fire cult, or serve an efreet or a gang of fire giants.

Roleplaying Encounters: Sindriza can be a valuable ally if she's allowed to satiate her destructive urges. She grows restless if kept on a short leash, even by a strong master, and is prone to verbally lash out at dwarves and elves if she can't physically attack them.
