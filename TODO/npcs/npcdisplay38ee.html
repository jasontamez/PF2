Rare tribes of halfling cannibals stalk deep jungles in search of sentient prey.

Lanani Shabu

When newcomers objecting to his matriarchal tribe's cannibalistic ways wiped out his kin, Lanani had no choice but to ritualistically take on new leadership-and a new gender. Now "Mother Lanani" hunts the jungle, punishing humans and recruiting halflings to her new tribe.

Combat Encounters: Lanani can stalk quarry for days, slowly weakening those she is not able to knock out with her poison. Other times, she heads a hunting band.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Lanani rarely interacts with the outside world, but in desperate times she ventures into civilization to lure prey closer to her tribe.
