Special Abilities

Signifer Mask (Su) A Hellknight signifer's mask-which is given to a signifer upon initiation-is often devoid of eyeholes or other personally identifying features, though it doesn't obscure the wearer's vision. While wearing it, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks and on saving throws against spells and abilities that rely on visual effects.

Seekers of magical power are just as likely to appreciate the value of imposed order as those with more martial skills. Most Hellknight orders augment their ranks with skilled spellcasters called signifers; these magicians enhance the order's efforts, either by directly targeting those who sow chaos or by improving the Hellknights' already impressive arsenals.

Though their spells are useful in direct support roles, Hellknight signifers are most feared for summoning diabolical beings, whether to savage their foes or test their allies.
