Tactics

During Combat While scouting at night, a
Lastwall border scout is sure to imbibe her
potion of darkvision and stay close to her allies.
In combat, she uses her bow to strike down foes from
a great distance, taking to melee only as a last resort.
Smokesticks allow the rangers to send signals to one
another while split up, and alchemist's fire ensures that
they can make short work of any trolls or other nasty foes
they encounter.
Morale If pressed by a force they cannot hope to defeat alone,
Lastwall border scouts do their best to evade and lose any
enemies following them before returning to Castle Everstand
or another nearby Lastwall border fort.

Everstand sent to watch the borderlands, though such
border rangers are masters of stealth and are rarely seen
unless they wish to be.
