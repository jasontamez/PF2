Tactics

Before Combat The monk often tries to reason or treat with potential foes in an effort to avoid unnecessary combat, or to quietly study enemies and discern each one's strengths and weaknesses. Once combat is unavoidable, he drinks potions of barkskin and bull's strength.
During Combat The monk trusts his improved evasion, high saves, and spell resistance to safeguard him against spellcasters, and focuses on martial opponents, combining Spring Attack and Stunning Fist. He uses Lunge against Small or Medium opponents, often using ki points to grant himself a bonus to AC and negate the penalty from using Lunge. When making a flurry of blows, he attempts a Stunning Fist on the first strike. He uses Snatch Arrows to return thrown weapons and Deadly Aim whenever he catches a weapon he is proficient with.

These monks are small, but powerful and well trained. Those who underestimate one of these halflings do so at their own peril.

Laoshi

Laoshi listens to the wind, and always does its bidding. Sometimes it tells him to help those in need. Other times it tells him to play his flute while a city burns. It's also led him on a number of adventures.

Combat Encounters: Though lawful, Laoshi is a servant of the wind. This can sometimes lead him to seemingly random acts, including outbursts of violence. In the end, however, it usually works out for the common good.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Laoshi makes his way through the land, playing his flute for the occasional coin. He hears much and often passes on that information to those the wind suggests.
