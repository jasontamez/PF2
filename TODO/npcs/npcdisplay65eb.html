Whether encountered alone or in a group of like-minded individuals, undead hunters let no one stand in the way of their grim work.

Torain Mirno

The last survivor of a half-orc tribe exterminated by a necromancer, Torain has devoted his life to cleansing the world of the taint of the unliving. His studious nature is a rarity among half-orcs, particularly in light of the savagery he unleashes upon the deathless hordes. While some hail him as a hero, his endless war has all but extinguished his sense of compassion and mercy.

Combat Encounters: Torain strikes hard and fast against those he believes serve undead or necromantic masters, often killing them before asking questions.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Between undead hunts, Torain holds silent vigils in a cemeteries and mausoleums, acting as a fierce and watchful warden against the rising dead.
