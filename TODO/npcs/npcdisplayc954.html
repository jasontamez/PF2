Sappers specialize in undermining fortifications and tunneling under walls. Using a combination of time, engineering, and explosives, sappers can rig a tunnel to collapse to protect a retreat or create a path over a mountainside. Their enthusiasm for blowing things up means they take unnecessary risks, and the lifespan of a professional sapper is often cut short in a dramatic blast.
