The unseen archer strikes from concealment, planning for his target to die before it has a chance to see him.

Roscolian

Roscolian is a mercenary sniper, willing to work alone or as part of a team as long as he gets to fight at a safe distance, shooting at creatures that don't know he's there. He doesn't care whether it's unfair or unsportsmanlike; he-d rather be a coward with a hundred kills than a hero with a sword in his neck. He relies on his ring of invisibility to keep him out of trouble, and isn't averse to abandoning his companions and fleeing invisibly if a battle goes wrong. He doesn't particularly like dungeons because he feels the narrow tunnels don't allow enough space between him and his targets.

Combat Encounters: When invisible, Roscolian can attack from anywhere, surprising unsuspecting PCs with a hail of deadly arrows and staying hidden until he can activate his ring again. Since he works best at a distance, he prefers situations where he can kill a target and then move before he is discovered.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Roscolian doesn't brag about what he does, and the PCs might think he is just a humble, local scout or archer. He'll work for almost anyone, so the PCs may be able to hire him-though only on his terms.
