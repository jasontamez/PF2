Tactics

Before Combat The paladin casts delay poison and protection from energy (electricity and fire) on herself, and greater magic weapon on her greatsword.
During Combat The paladin targets the most powerful creature present or an obviously demonic target. She uses her divine bond to add the brilliant energy, holy, keen, and speed special abilities to her greatsword as appropriate, and uses mercies to counteract any negative conditions or afflictions she gains.

The demon hunter has sworn to battle the hordes of the Abyss. Though the demons constantly tempt her and try to lead her from her path, she remains resolute-though somewhat paranoid and difficult to befriend because of the number of allies she's seen slain.
