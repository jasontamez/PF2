Tactics

Before Combat The fighter drinks her potions of bull's strength, cat's grace, and barkskin. If she's planning betrayal, a scheming fencer doesn't down her potions until just before her treachery.
During Combat The fighter uses Combat Expertise, hoping to wear her foes down. Every few rounds, she makes a disarm attempt with one of her attacks. She likes to gain a height advantage using her slippers of spider climbing.

Cosmopolitan patrons hire scheming fencers as either bodyguards or enforcers. Groups of these warriors can also serve as soldiers, guards, and protectors.

Eralin Lisinar

Sadistic and manipulative, Eralin prefers a long, drawn out battle over a clean and efficient kill. She deals death in nicks and cuts and twists of her blades. Never one for a fair fight, she deliberately seeks out opponents who can't match her skill.
