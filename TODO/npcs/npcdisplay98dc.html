Special Abilities

Combine Poison (Ex) Three times per day, the Daggermark poisoner can combine two different poisons without reducing their efficacy, and apply them to the same weapon, object, or trap. A creature exposed to the poisons must save against both.

Master Poisoner (Ex) The Daggermark poisoner's levels in the Daggermark poisoner prestige class stack with her rogue levels when determining her bonus on Craft (alchemy) checks dealing with poison granted by this ability.

Quick Poisoning (Ex) The Daggermark poisoner can poison a weapon as a move action. She can create poisons with the Craft (alchemy) skill in half the normal amount of time.

Toxic Apothecary (Ex and Sp) The Daggermark poisoner can use detect poison at will (range 5 feet) as a swift action. She gains a bonus equal to half her Daggermark poisoner level on Heal checks dealing with poison, and on a successful check she adds this bonus to the saving throw bonus she provides her patient against the treated poison.

Toxic Manufactory (Ex) When creating poisons or antitoxins, the Daggermark poisoner can create a number of doses equal to her Intelligence modifier at one time (minimum 1). These additional doses do not increase the time required, but do increase the raw material cost accordingly. In addition, she uses the item's gp value as its sp value when determining progress made with her Craft (alchemy) checks.

Trapster (Ex) The Daggermark poisoner adds her class level on Perception skill checks made to locate traps and on Craft and Disable Device checks regarding poisonous traps. She also adds a +1 bonus on attack rolls, save DCs, and Perception and Disable Device DCs for poisoned traps she creates.

Poison is widely used throughout the Inner Sea and across Golarion, but the Daggermark Poisoners' Guild produces artists of toxins. The guild is closely allied with the Daggermark Assassins' Guild, and it's rumored that the founder killed the last king of Daggermark.
