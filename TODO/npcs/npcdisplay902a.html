Yenelis Halfelven

Story is everything to Yenelis Halfelven. She yearns to craft the most amazing story of her generation, but such a story cannot be a mere fiction-it must be based in fact. She travels with promising adventurers, hoping their deeds will spark her perfect story, but so far has always been disappointed.

Combat Encounters: At first, Yenelis only observed the adventurers she traveled with, but now she aids them, hoping her abilities can push them in the right direction.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Yenelis scours taverns and pubs, looking for the group that will finally give her the perfect story.
