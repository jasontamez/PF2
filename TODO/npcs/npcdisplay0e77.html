These guardians of mountain peaks traffic with air and ice elementals, summoning forth the spirits of the mountain storms in order to protect their sacred places.

Yala of the High Places

Yala lives on a mountaintop far to the north. Abandoned by her parents at a young age because of the inconvenience her mixed heritage caused both their families, she was raised by a tribe of yetis, who quickly began venerating her when her druidic powers developed. Never feeling entirely comfortable with her role or the society of the great creatures, she now lives a solitary existence tending a remote shrine dedicated to winter and the mountains themselves. Her enchanted shield was a gift from a courting yeti chief, but she ultimately rejected his advances.

Combat Encounters: Whenever possible, Yala faces enemies near a precipice, using her air magic to throw her foes from the heights and dash them against the rocks below-a blood offering to the ancient mountains.

Roleplaying Suggestions: A cold and aloof woman, Yala prefers the company of animals and summoned elementals to that of humanoids. She is obsessed with protecting the purity of her mountain home, but what "angers the stones" is often hard for others to predict.
