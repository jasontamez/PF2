Koriel Dragonchild

The descendant of a white dragon and an elf, Koriel was driven to prove herself by killing a draconic relation and eating his heart, claiming his territory and hoard.

Combat Encounters: Koriel maintains a vast expanse of mountains as her domain, and those who enter it must pay tribute or surrender their lives.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Koriel sees herself as more dragon than elf, and lives as if she were a full-blooded dragon, killing those who say otherwise.
