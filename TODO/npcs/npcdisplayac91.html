Kelgul Klagan

Those who think that a dwarf cannot become an exquisite equestrian should not speak that opinion within earshot of Kelgul Klagan. He is called "the Klager" by his companions and subordinates, a mix of his family name and the sound of his mount's clattering hooves. He commands his soldiers from horseback, and those who know of him joke that he leaves his horse only to drink, sleep, and relieve himself-and maybe not always then. When they talk about his combat prowess, or when the dwarf himself is near, the joking ends, for he is a juggernaut of metal and divine fury, stern-faced and unforgiving in the face of evil and injustice. Kelgul uses few words, even for a dwarf. When in combat, though, he barks orders and expects them to be followed, even by those not under his direct command.

Combat Encounters: Kelgul is typically encountered with a group of his soldiers. If he has reason to believe the PCs are up to no good, he orders his troops to attack and take the PCs prisoner. If his soldiers are outmatched, he charges forward to rally them and to smite the most powerful enemy.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Kelgul is quiet, and content to stay out of diplomatic endeavors. When he is inclined to speak, he is surprisingly soft-spoken and courteous, though it is hard to tell whether his politeness is sincere or merely what he considers formally appropriate. Those who mistake this for weakness, however, soon learn the folly of their assumptions.
