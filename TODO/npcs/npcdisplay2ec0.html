Boon Slayers can obtain poisons for the PCs at a 20% discount. They can also arrange to kill or capture targets for the PCs' for 20% less than their usual fee (as determined by the GM).

Slayers are cold-blooded killers, assassins for hire. They are cunning tricksters, deadly snipers, masters of the knife in the back and the storm of shuriken whistling from either hand. Slayers may also be used as ninjas, spies, or particularly deadly enforcers.

Slayers often work alone, sometimes as chief enforcer for a guild master (CR 11), but many work with accomplices, such as three burglars (CR 9), a pair of highwaymen (CR 10), or a half-dozen slavers (CR 10).
