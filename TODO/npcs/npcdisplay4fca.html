The First Guard of Absalom is an elite military force tasked with protecting the city of Absalom in case of siege. Founded in 23 ar by the god Aroden, who commanded soldiers to defend the city walls against the First Siege of Absalom, the First Guard has stood vigil over the city ever since, and its members play a large role in the City at the Center of the World's impenetrable defenses. Thanks to the efforts of the First Guard, the city has never, in the course of its nearly 5 millennia of existence, fallen to either outside invaders or plots from within its walls.

The First Guard today consists not only of elite soldiers, but also of skilled wizards and scouts who dedicate themselves to uncovering any threats to the safety of the city and to dealing with any dangers as they arise. While each member of the First Guard brings her own talents and training to her post, all soldiers are drilled in melee combat (usually with both a polearm and a sword), military tactics, the laws of Absalom, and the use of siege engines in the event the city's walls should need to be defended at a moment's notice.

Members of the First Guard serve in a much more militaristic role than their counterparts on the city watch, with whom they share their headquarters in Azlanti Keep. Unlike the city watch, whose duties consist of keeping the peace and policing the city's laws, the First Guard is ever vigilant for threats to the city from both beyond and within its walls. The First Guard wards Azlanti Keep and makes up the core of the Absalom military, commanding other troops-both enlisted and conscripted-in times of war.

The First Guard is unique in that each soldier within the unit swears an oath to defend the city of Absalom, but not specifically to defend the Grand Council. In the millennia since the First Guard's founding, such a stipulation has saved the city on numerous occasions when the guards' investigations into members of the council uncovered treasonous plots. Bringing these conspiracies to justice has always been a relatively simple matter because no First Guard soldier ever questions where her true loyalties lie.
