Tactics

Before Combat The wizard casts mage armor, false life, resist energy (fire), and see invisibility.
During Combat The wizard casts solid fog on a group of enemies, then casts wall of fire in a circle (focused inward) around the solid fog. As opponents leave the fog, he attacks them directly with eyebite and enervation. He might cast fear to drive opponents through the wall of fire, or cast fireball on a group of opponents grouped together.
Base Statistics Without false life, mage armor, resist energy, and see invisibility, the wizard's statistics are Senses darkvision 60 ft.; AC 12, touch 11, flat-footed 11; hp 85; Resist none.

The undead creator dispassionately crafts unlife out of dead flesh and bone.

Tyrek Glodfer

Tyrek's love of necromancy is not due to evil motives or megalomaniacal goals, but rather stems from his clinical view of other creatures as mere objects to be manipulated in either life or death. He is as likely to purchase an unusual corpse from a poor family as he is to raid a graveyard for the parts he needs. Though working with negative energy will eventually corrupt him and turn him fully evil, for now he is an amoral scholar of the thin line between life, death, and undeath.

Combat Encounters: Tyrek is usually found with undead minions he created, allied undead creatures, or death cultists paying him for his services. He rarely believes the stakes of a battle are high enough to get involved, unless he's attacked or his enemies threaten to stop him from continuing his work.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Tyrek is willing to join adventurers if their travels involve strange or new kinds of undead for him to examine or capture for further study. If any of his allies die, he's more likely to examine the corpse, raise it from the dead, or use it for parts than to mourn.
