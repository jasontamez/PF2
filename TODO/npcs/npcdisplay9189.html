Tactics

Before Combat The barbarian uses potions if expecting a major confrontation. His ring of blinking operates continuously.
During Combat The barbarian begins combat with Dazzling Display and terrifying howl. Against a small group, he makes Flyby Attacks, using Lunge and potions of enlarge person to extend his reach and avoid attacks of opportunity, and Great Cleave against targets clustered together. In close combat, he uses intimidating glare along with Great Cleave attacks, using knockback to force enemies into close quarters. He relies on his ring of blinking to avoid most attacks, and with his tireless rage he exits and re-enters rage whenever it's convenient to regain the use rage powers he can use only once per rage.
