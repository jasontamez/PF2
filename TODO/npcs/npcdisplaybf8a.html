Tactics

Before Combat The fighter drinks his potions of barkskin and bear's endurance, then activates his ring of blinking and boots of speed.
During Combat The fighter starts off with a Dazzling Display, then engages in melee, fighting less armored enemies first. He deals most of his attacks with the spear end of his weapon.

Though most criminal masterminds work behind the scenes, crime lords don't mind getting their hands dirty.

Tontelizi Legbreaker

When Tontelizi first took to a life of crime, he was relegated to leg-breaking as a joke on his slight stature-and collections doubled. Soon, the crime family found that Tontelizi excelled at any task involving extortion, intimidation, or violence. When the patriarch's health failed-assisted by Tontelizi's poison-the gnome eliminated two likely successors and cowed the rest with threats and blackmail. He was chosen to take over the family with nearly unanimous support.
