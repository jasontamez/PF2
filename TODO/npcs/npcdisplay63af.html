Tactics

Before Combat The wizard casts mage armor. When she prepares spells, she uses physical enhancement to increase her Constitution. She studies the combat area for the best places to use spells like grease and web, then hides in ambush.
During Combat The wizard casts web on her opponents or in their path (especially if there is a pit or ravine present). She casts summon swarm into the web. If trapped opponents are escaping from the web, she casts empowered burning hands on them.
Base Statistics Without mage armor, the wizard's statistics are AC 14, touch 13, flat-footed 11.

Jungle wizards live in harmony with nature. They're frequently mistaken for druids, and often use such misunderstandings to their advantage. Many jungle wizards use natural materials for their magical gear, such as large leaves or hides for spellbooks and scrolls, unworked tree branches for wands, or grasses that can be knotted into the shapes of rings.

Mandar Tamarice

Mandar is a hermit living in the jungle, content to go for weeks without speaking to anyone. When dealing with strangers, she deliberately acts savage and bestial so they underestimate her power and knowledge. She sometimes obtains valuable spell components or minor magic items by treating them like trinkets, thereby keeping anyone from realizing how valuable they actually are. Some assume that since Mandar lives in the wild she has a grudge against civilization, like many druids do. This isn't the case; she simply prefers solitude. In fact, she loves some creature comforts, and might trade spellcasting services or information to nearby villages in exchange for food, clothing, or sweets for both herself and her familiar, Eink. This monkey follows her everywhere, and usually shows better street smarts than his master.

Combat Encounters: Mandar attacks the PCs-or leads villagers to attack them-in order to protect her territory or a magical site. She has allies among both arcane scholars and the druids, and could appear alongside adventurers of either type (though both sides find her a little strange).

Roleplaying Suggestions: Mandar might spy on the PCs using beast shape or her monkey familiar before crossing their path to question them. If they notice her savagery is an act, she drops the pretense right away and shows the true depth of her knowledge.
