Clairian Arrowsong

The daughter of a pair of academics, Clairian Arrowsong was never interested in the studious pursuits her parents encouraged. From an early age, Clairian showed promise as both an excellent archer and bard, despite her parents' misgivings about both "hobbies." In the hours she was supposed to be studying in solitude, she escaped to hear the orators and bards who congregated outside of the city's university. But not until she saw her first archery tournament did she find her real passion. None but her parents were surprised when, as a young woman, she ran away with a sorcerer who served as a soothsayer on the tournament circuit.

Combat Encounters: For extra coin and adventure, Clairian hires herself out as an archer to local princelings, bandit lords, and thieves' guilds. Though she serves with skill, she would rather surrender than die for another's cause.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Quick with song and laughter, Clairian doesn't take the plights of others too seriously. She would rather live the good life and have fun than be tied down to lords or obligations.
