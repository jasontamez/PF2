Tactics

Before Combat The monk prefers to ambush foes, and uses his diamond body ability to poison either his spear or at least two javelins without risk to himself.
During Combat The monk prefers to fight from horseback, and uses Ride-By Attack and Lunge to hit foes so he faces little risk of retaliation. He often uses Stunning Fist on the first pass, and if successful follows with a Spirited Charge. Against other mounted foes, he uses Improved Trip to unhorse his opponents if possible.

Asim the Crimson Bandit

Asim's family had a long tradition of robbing travelers, but he was determined to end that life, seeking out a monastery to remake himself. His riches went to the temple to fund good works, and he gave his expensive clothes to the poor. Yet when territorial changes found the monastery's lands full of invaders, he found himself leading the resistance. Often this war requires robbing the supply trains of his enemies, and what Asim steals he splits between the poor and the war effort.

Combat Encounters: Asim is rarely without several fellow monks. He is always wary, and would rather question an incapacitated foe than fall for an enemy's trap.

Roleplaying Suggestions: More than anything, Asim wants to return to the peaceful life of an ascetic.
