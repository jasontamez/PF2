Tactics

During Combat The paladin reserves most of his spells and magic items for helping allies against a common foe. He uses Cleave as often as possible against grouped opponents, and Lunge and Stand Still to control the movement of multiple enemies. He uses his divine bond to give his longspear the defending, holy, keen, or speed special ability.
Base Statistics Without greater magic weapon, the paladin's statistics are Melee +1 flaming longspear +25/+20/+15/+10 (1d6+7/??3 plus 1d6 fire).

The furious crusader is a compact bundle of holy power with a chip on his shoulder.

Hellin Tallhallow

Short, stout for a halfling, and powerful, Hellin sees himself as the quintessential paladin-and does not suffer fools who doubt his prowess or speak condescendingly about his size. Most of the time he is a cheerful defender of everything lawful and good, but he is quick to anger if small folk or innocents are threatened, abused, or mocked.

Combat Encounters: Hellin picks fights with slavers or slave owners, even in lands where slavery is legal or ignored. In his mind, those who turn a blind eye are just as guilty as those who forge the chains.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Hellin may need assistance with freeing or protecting a particularly large band of slaves.
