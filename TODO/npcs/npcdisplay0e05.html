Zened Mirces

Zened adventures to gain seed money to start a business.

Combat Encounters: Zened works best with several bodyguards or in a low-level adventuring party.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Zened does nothing for free (including healing allies) and often attempts to renegotiate contracts precisely when his "comrades" need him most.
