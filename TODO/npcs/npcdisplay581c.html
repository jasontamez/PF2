A bounty hunter brings back his targets dead or alive.

Alec Renatus

Alec hunts people to bring them to justice, not because he enjoys killing. He uses deadly force only if he must to protect himself or others. He tries to learn as much as possible about his target before starting his pursuit, and selects potions and other items based on the best tactics for capturing that person.

Combat Encounters: Alec generally does work only for legitimate and lawful governments, but might attempt to capture a PC if he was deceived into believing that PC has broken the law.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Alec could approach the PCs to gain their help in capturing a particularly difficult target.
