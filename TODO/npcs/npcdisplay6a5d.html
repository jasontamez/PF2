The bramble sorcerer serves the interests of green dragons, walking where his masters cannot and speaking on their behalf to other forest dwellers.

Amriel Thask

Amriel is a hollow shell of a man. He was raised to believe dragons are the true masters of the world, and his will is so broken that he cannot believe otherwise. When in the presence of a dragon, he hangs on the creature's every word, and is greatly tempted to grovel like a slave. When away from dragons, he is arrogant and condescending, knowing that the dragons have chosen him to interact with lesser races so they do not have to. His greatest hope is to become a dragon disciple so that he can become closer in flesh and spirit to his masters.

Combat Encounters: Amriel could be the guardian of or advisor to a young dragon, an agent of a more mature dragon, or the leader of a kobold tribe.

Roleplaying Encounters: Amriel might be a liaison between the PCs and a nearby dragon, an agent of a secretive group of druids, or the last survivor of a dragon cult that was wiped out by a hostile force.
