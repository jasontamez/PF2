Esmerelda Darkshadow

Those who think all elves are creatures of light and joy have not met Esmerelda. Dressing in dark colors with a temperament to match, Esmerelda believes she is doomed to a life of pain and gloom. Only when her enemies lie broken at her feet does she crack the slightest hint of a smile. Yet this dour disposition is not simply part of her nature-as a young woman, Esmerelda was told by an oracle that she would bring ruin and destruction to everything she ever loved. Two days later, her wife-to-be was slain by orcs. Resolved to never love again, she paints herself gray with ash to symbolize the death she carries.

Combat Encounters: Esmerelda travels the world alone, attacking those who trigger her mercurial temper (such as by not keeping their distance). Any sort of romantic proposition or prophecy magic sends her into a rage.

Roleplaying Suggestions: All Esmerelda can talk about is the ultimate futility of life and the inevitability of death and decay.
