A dragon smiter is sworn to slay dragons.

Telthor Grimblade

When she was only 8 years old, Telthor's entire village was consumed by dragon fire, but she was found unharmed in the rubble by priests of the goddess of valor. Seeing her survival as a miracle, the priests adopted her. For years, she suffered from terrible nightmares of fire and leathery wings. Since killing her first dragon, however, she has not had a single nightmare.

Combat Encounters: Telthor prefers to hunt alone, and might attempt to drive off anyone she thinks is unworthy of battling dragons with her. She refuses to let anyone turn her aside when she has a dragon in her path, though she is honorable and grants quarter if asked.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Telthor is quiet and suspicious, believing there are spies everywhere working for the dragons. She is currently seeking to acquire a flying magic item (a carpet of flying in particular) and is willing to team up with PCs who can direct her to where one can be found.
