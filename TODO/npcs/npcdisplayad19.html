Galeth Redbeard

Galeth is dour, even for a dwarf, and rarely speaks unless questioned.

Combat Encounters: Galeth might be a solitary hunter, the lead member of an underground army, or part of a unit of guards wielding crossbows.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Galeth could be discovered barely alive, stuck in a dungeon trap.
