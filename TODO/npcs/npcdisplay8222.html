Special Abilities

Black E-Pick (Ex) This electronic lockpick allows the user to attempt Disable Device checks against electronic devices and grants its user a +1 competence bonus on the check. Thieves' tools do not apply to Disable Device checks against electronic devices. An e-pick has 10 charges; using the e-pick as part of a Disable Device check consumes one charge. An e-pick weighs 1 pound and is worth 100 gp.

Implanted Tracker Chip (Ex) This chip allows its carrier to be tracked remotely with a chipfinder (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide). Finding evidence of it requires a full-round search of the carrier and a successful DC 30 Perception check. Extracting the chip requires a slashing weapon and deals 1 point of damage to the carrier.

Long experience with the threats of Silver Mount often leaves Technic League members reluctant to risk their own lives in exploration. Rather, when they gain access to a new chamber in the Mount or other trove of lost technology, they sometimes rely on hirelings and specialized slaves. Also called canaries, metal rats, and silver divers, these delvers are valued for their skill but still seen as expendable. While most hire on voluntarily, offering their services in exchange for coin and adventure, some are adventurers who were caught trespassing in the Technic League's domain, and now pay for their continued existence with this risky form of servitude.

Hirelings are searched for any sign of contraband whenever they exit the Mount. Attempts to hide technology bring harsh, public punishment as a warning to others. The Technic League secretly implants tracking devices in most metal rats to prevent them from escaping with technological secrets, attributing the scar to injections given to protect against exotic plagues and poisons.
