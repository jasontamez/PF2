Tactics

Before Combat A Technic League captain casts mage armor, shield, and overland flight before entering combat.
During Combat The captain prefers to use a stun gun or ranged spells in combat, allowing any minions at hand to keep foes engaged in melee.
Morale A Technic League captain flees if reduced to 20 hit points or fewer-whether or not the captain resurfaces later is up to you, but this adventure assumes that captains who escape don't return to further vex the PCs.
