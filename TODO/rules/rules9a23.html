You must have the proper writing materials to create a forgery. If the handwriting doesn't need to be specific to a person, you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on the check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, which grants a +4 bonus on the check. You need a larger handwriting sample to forge a longer document in that person's script.

The GM rolls a Society check to create a forgery secretly, so you're not sure how good your forgery is until someone examines the work. The examiner attempts an opposed Society check, modified by any applicable bonuses or penalties listed under the decipher writing function of Society.

Action: 1 minute to 1d4 minutes per page to create a forgery, or 1 round per page to detect a forgery.

Try Again: Yes, though examiners who encounter forged documents will be more cautious of future documents.
