The main danger with enchantments lies in removing agency from a character, either a PC or NPC, and the main difficulty in running them is adjudicating just how much they do so. As such, they are much easier to deal with than divinations, as they have less variety in the difficulties that arise. In all cases, a DC 25 (or lower) Sense Motive check notices that someone is enchanted. (See <a href="rulesd1d4.html?Name=Sense%20Motive&amp;Category=Skills%20in%20Conflict">Skills in Conflict</a> for more information on using Sense Motive to detect enchantment.)

<a href="spelldisplay697d.html?ItemName=Charm%20Person">Charm Person</a>: The main thing to remember about charm magic is that it is not a compulsion (that is a different subschool of enchantment), which means it doesn't directly force someone to do something. Instead, the spell basically makes someone feel like the caster is a friend, and puts what the caster says in the best possible light. Just like in the <a href="rules7de8.html?Name=Diplomacy&amp;Category=Skills%20in%20Conflict">Diplomacy section of Skills in Conflict</a>, being someone's friend doesn't mean the caster gets to dictate everything they do, and even the opposed Charisma check the spell grants can only go so far; it doesn't compel them to act exactly as the caster desires.

For instance, an evil necromancer might be willing to allow her friend to sit as her new right hand, but she won't quit her entire life's goal just because a friend asked, even with an opposed Charisma check. This advice applies equally as well to other charm spells (such as <a href="spelldisplaya43e.html?ItemName=charm%20animal">charm animal</a> and <a href="spelldisplaye96b.html?ItemName=charm%20monster">charm monster</a>).

<a href="spelldisplayd62f.html?ItemName=Suggestion">Suggestion</a>: <a href="spelldisplayd62f.html?ItemName=Suggestion">Suggestion</a> and its ilk, on the other hand, actually are mind-controlling spells. The key to <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> is that it has to be presented in a reasonable fashion-and certain suggestions would simply never be reasonable for the target in question. The more creative the player, or the sharper his understanding of an NPC's motivations, the more often he can use this spell to his advantage. Players should be rewarded for this type of ingenuity, especially at lower levels when <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> is one of the most powerful spells available. In mid-level play (or for a resourceful low-level villain), adversaries might start to succeed at Sense Motive checks to notice <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> effects, potentially using <a href="spelldisplay435e.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20evil">protection from evil</a> or similar spells to either protect against them or end ongoing compulsions.
