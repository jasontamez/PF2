This creature has access to nature magic, much like a druid would. However, turning it into a spellcaster would make it feel unlike a burly <a href="monsterdisplaycf4f.html?ItemName=Frost%20Giant">frost giant</a>. Instead, this stat block starts with the combatant array and draws inspiration from the options of the druid class graft. This monster is meant to fight alongside a <a href="rules6eb2.html?Name=Mastodon&amp;Category=Monster%20Examples">mastodon</a> as a CR 13 encounter.
Array: The frost giant uses the combatant array and gains its spellcasting from its magic options. Its Reflex and Will +save bonuses are swapped.
Creature Type: Because the monster's saving throws are uniformly high, it has a -2 penalty to Reflex instead of increasing any save from the humanoid graft.
Class: Though the giant doesn't use the druid graft, many of its options are drawn from there.
Subtype: The giant subtype grants low-light vision and gives Intimidate as a good skill.
Size: Because it's Large, the giant decreases its touch AC from 17 to 16 and raises its flat-footed AC from 21 to 22. Its CMB changes from +21 to +23, and its CMD goes from 32 to 33.
Spells: The giant gains a few spells from the Animal spell list due to the secondary magic option. Even though that option says to take the primary spells from the spell lists, it's reasonable to pick and choose from among both the primary and secondary spells of the monster's CR band, as was done here.
Options: Instead of one of its combat options, the giant gains the powerful summons magic option. It spends its other combat option on rock throwing and its any option on secondary magic.
Skills: With its good skill from the giant subtype, the explorer has only one master skill, but a well-rounded set of good skills.
Damage: The giant's thrown rock attack uses the low attack and damage values.
