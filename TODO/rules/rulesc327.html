Most spells that directly affect creatures with a magical effect should allow a saving throw. Spells that create nonmagical materials that then strike or impede creatures (such as <a href="spelldisplay88d2.html?ItemName=ice%20storm">ice storm</a> and <a href="spelldisplayfdf2.html?ItemName=sleet%20storm">sleet storm</a>) do not normally require a saving throw.

Spells that require the caster to make an attack roll to hit (even if it's a ranged touch attack) may or may not require a saving throw (<a href="spelldisplayf241.html?ItemName=enervation">enervation</a> and <a href="spelldisplaya67c.html?ItemName=searing%20light">searing light</a> do not, <a href="spelldisplay2b8a.html?ItemName=disintegrate">disintegrate</a> does). Attack effects that do not require rolling damage should always allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the effect; otherwise, the spell becomes an obvious choice for anyone of the level to cast it.

Tip: When deciding whether or not the spell should have a saving throw, consider how you-d feel if someone used the spell on your favorite PC. If your PC didn't get any chance to resist the effect with a save or to dodge it entirely because of a failed attack roll, would you be annoyed, embarrassed, or angry? If so, you should give the spell some kind of save or attack roll, just so it's not an always-effective option.

Fortitude Saves: Spells with Fortitude saves usually physically transform the target, apply an effect you-d normally resist with a Fortitude save (such as disease or poison), or are a form of attack that sheer physical toughness is enough to resist. In general, making a successful Fortitude save means the effect hits, but the target toughs it out, like a bear shrugging off the stinky musk sprayed by a skunk. Note that if your spell only affects creatures-not objects-then nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead are immune to the spell. For example, this makes them immune to creature-oriented polymorphing spells, but not spells such as <a href="spelldisplay2b8a.html?ItemName=disintegrate">disintegrate</a>, which can attack objects.

Reflex Save: Spells with Reflex saves usually create a physical burst or spread in an area, like an explosion, which the target is able to dodge with a successful saving throw. In general, making a successful Reflex save means the target dodged the effect, or the effect rolled over or around the target with a lesser effect. Note that you shouldn't build a spell where the caster makes an attack roll and the target also makes a Reflex saving throw; doing so brings Dexterity into play twice for the same spell (once for the target's AC, once for the target's Reflex save modifier).

Will Saves: Spells with Will saves are mental, mind-affecting attacks; the target resists with pure mental power, by using evasive thoughts or noticing flaws in the spell's assault that can negate its effectiveness. A Will save is like a mental version of a Fortitude save; the effect "hits" the target, and whether or not it succeeds depends on the target's willpower. Most direct-attack Will-save spells (such as <a href="spelldisplayea78.html?ItemName=sleep">sleep</a> and <a href="spelldisplaya376.html?ItemName=phantasmal%20killer">phantasmal killer</a>) are mind-affecting effects (see Descriptors, below).

Some spells can be cast on objects, and the object only gets a saving throw if it is a magic item or is held by a creature; these spells should have -(object)- listed after the type of saving throw (see <a href="spelldisplay2e10.html?ItemName=shrink%20item">shrink item</a>).

Helpful spells and spells that do not harm the target in any way either should have no saving throw, or should allow a saving throw but have -(harmless)- listed after the type of saving throw (see <a href="spelldisplayd685.html?ItemName=fly">fly</a>).

Spells that only affect the caster never require a saving throw (you-d never try to resist a beneficial spell you're casting on yourself ), so you don't list a saving throw for those spells at all (see <a href="spelldisplay10d2.html?ItemName=true%20strike">true strike</a>).
