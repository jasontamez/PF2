When you're running a freeform challenge where wits and charm are more effective than quick reflexes, it might become important to determine the order in which different characters (both PCs and NPCs) perform their actions. In such cases, consider having each character roll a social initiative check. Rather than being Dexterity-based, a social initiative check is Charisma-based, though all other standard methods for increasing initiative (such as the <a href="featdisplay9c1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Initiative">Improved Initiative</a> feat) still apply.
