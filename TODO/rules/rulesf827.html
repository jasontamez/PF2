Some adventures can confer additional benefits to make it easier for the characters to overcome upcoming obstacles. Often you can describe these story benefits in advance, increasing the players' investment in the proceedings. <ul><li>"By driving the orcs out of the valley, you'll make it safe for the peasants who live on your landholding." </li><li>"By capturing the Golden Cornucopia, you can save the besieged residents of High Castle from starvation." </li><li>"By disarming the astral cannon, you can stop the priests of Urgathoa from decimating the paladin army."</li> Sometimes story benefits become obvious after the characters overcome a crucial obstacle. The PCs may discover only in retrospect that they've saved farmers, lifted the siege of High Castle, or shielded a paladin army.

Story benefits can provide information, grant political influence, or allow NPC allies to overcome rivals and enemies. They allow adventurers to meet or solidify connections to important NPCs. As with any exciting ongoing story, a success often leads to a new challenge, and additional obstacles and encounters for the heroes to overcome.
