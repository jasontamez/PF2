Years ago, a vicious purge sought to wipe the poor and wretched from their homes in the city's slums, until a mysterious creature came to their salvation. Now, a generation later, the bodies of city authorities are left broken on the slum's streets for all to see.

Discovery: The PCs are called on to investigate the murders and find the corpses brutally smashed and savagely disfigured in ways hardly possible for mortal man. Locals suspect a dimwitted strongman from a traveling freak show, but the true culprit is a deadly <a href="monsterdisplaya3f9.html?ItemName=Clay%20Golem">clay golem</a> once built for protection.

Adversary: The secret society responsible for the original purge is planning another. They decided it would be truly poetic if the same protector that stopped the previous purge became the spark for the new one. Using the <a href="spelldisplay86ed.html?ItemName=awaken%20construct">awaken construct</a> spell, the son of the purge's original architect awakened the old protector, whose creator had since died of old age, and convinced it that he was its father. After sending it out to commit murders of authorities and build anger against the slums, the young aristocrat plans to betray the golem and come out of that betrayal as the hero who stopped the murders, as he leads a second retributive purge of the slums.

Further Adventures: The PCs may defeat the golem, but unless they uncover the true plans of the secret society, they haven't thwarted the new purge. Will the PCs come to the rescue of those who cannot protect themselves? Convincing the golem of the truth might net the PCs a powerful ally, but if they destroyed it, they might need to find the old golem crafter's notes and try to teach themselves the occult rituals he used so they can fashion a new golem, if they are to have any hope of defeating the cult's foul undertaking.
