Prestige Points represent your ability to leverage your Fame. You earn Prestige Points (PP) by completing objectives during the course of play. The GM decides which deeds, goals, or story elements are most important and awards players for completing them accordingly. Each time your Fame increases, you also gain 1 Prestige Point. In a typical campaign, you should gain approximately 4 to 6 Prestige Points per character level. Your current Prestige Points can never exceed your Fame. You can't share Prestige Points with other characters; only the character who earned them can spend them. Most of the time, you spend points on rewards-titles, temporary abilities, or bonuses on tasks associated with your interests.
