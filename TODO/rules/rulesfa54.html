Damage Reduction (4 RP; see special): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race gain DR 5/magic. Special: This can be increased to DR 10/magic for an additional 2 RP. The type of DR can be changed to one of the alignments (chaos, evil, good, or law) if the race is of the outsider (native) type with ties to the appropriate plane (chaos for a race with ties to a lawful-aligned plane, evil for a race with ties to a good-aligned plane, etc.) for an additional 2 RP.

Elemental Immunity (4 RP): Prerequisite: Outsider (native) with ties to an elemental plane; Benefit: Pick one of the following energy types that corresponds to the plane the race has ties to: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire). Members of this race are immune to the chosen energy type. Special: This trait can be taken more than once. Each additional time you take this trait, increase its cost by 1 RP. Each time it is taken, select another energy type that corresponds to another elemental plane the race has ties to. If a race has vulnerability to fire and immunity to cold, it gains the cold subtype. If a race has vulnerability to cold and immunity to fire, it gains the fire subtype.

Fast Healing (6 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race regain 1 hit point each round. Except for where noted here, fast healing is just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Fast healing continues to function (even at negative hit points) until a member of this race dies, at which point the effects of fast healing immediately end. Special: This trait can be taken multiple times. Each time fast healing is taken, its cost increases by 1 RP.

Rock Catching (2 RP): Prerequisite: Large size quality; Benefit: Members of this race can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or projectiles of similar shape). Once per round, a member of this race that would normally be hit by a rock can make a Reflex saving throw to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium rock, and 25 for a Large rock (if the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount). The member of this race must be aware of the attack in order to make a rock catching attempt.
