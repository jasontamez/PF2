As GM, you want the most out of your players, and you know them as well as anyone. Some deal well with setbacks. Some love to hog attention. Some only shine when things are clear; others are leaders when things are thoroughly muddled.

One way to handle these differences is to acknowledge them. Sometimes simply saying, "Hey, you're hogging the spotlight" is a better solution than trying to passively-aggressively give more attention to everyone else. As long as you confront the behavior rather than the person, it's often possible for a given player to learn to play in sync with the group's style.
