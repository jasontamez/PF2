These abilities manipulate mental states to either hinder enemies or boost allies. Many of them are more applicable in combat than other social options.

Aura of Resistance: Choose two effect descriptors (such as fear or charm). Allies within 10 feet of the monster gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against effects with those descriptors.

Bolstering Presence: As a standard action, the monster emits an aura that extends from it in a 30-foot radius and lasts for 1 minute. Any allied creature in the aura gains a +2 bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks.

Demoralize Foes: As a full-round action, the monster can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet of it. When the monster reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it can use this ability as a free action.

Dread: As a standard action, the monster causes each creature it chooses within 30 feet of it to become shaken for 1 minute. This option doesn't cause a shaken creature to become frightened or frightened creature to become panicked.

Fascinate: As a standard action, the monster forces any number of creatures within 90 feet of it that can see, hear, and pay attention to it to make a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5). On a failure, a target becomes fascinated for 1 minute or until it sees someone make a hostile move such as drawing a sword or casting a spell. If successful, the target is immune to this ability for 24 hours.

Heroic Recovery: Once per day, the monster can grant itself and every ally within 60 feet an additional saving throw against one effect affecting it.

Inspire Competence: As a standard action, the monster grants a +5 competence bonus on skill checks using a particular skill to one ally within 30 feet of it that can hear it. The effect ends if the monster is killed, knocked unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to use a free action to continue the inspiration each round.

Inspire Courage: As a standard action, the monster grants a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects to every ally that can hear it. The bonuses increase to +2 at CR 4, +3 at CR 10, and +4 at CR 16. At CR 6, the monster can start this effect as a free action. The effect ends if the monster is killed, knocked unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to use a free action to continue the inspiration each round.

Inspire Fear: As a standard action, the monster forces each enemy creature within 30 feet of it that can hear it to attempt a Will saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes frightened and must flee from the monster's presence for 1 minute or until it can no longer hear the monster. If successful, the target becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Inspire Heroics: As a standard action, the monster and one willing ally within 30 feet of it gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 minute. The effect ends if the monster is killed, knocked unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to use a free action to continue the inspiration each round.

Weakening Presence: The monster emits an aura that extends from it in a 30-foot radius. Any enemy creature in the aura takes a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks. A target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) when it starts its turn in the aura. If successful, the target is immune to this aura's effect for 24 hours.
