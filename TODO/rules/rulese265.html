The following feats are either new feats or Core Rulebook feats adapted to work with the wound threshold system. Though the system doesn't require their use, they're a great way to expand the role of wound thresholds in your game.

Critical Cure

Your healing is more effective if your patient is badly injured.

Benefit: When you cast a conjuration (healing) spell, it cures 1 additional hit point if the recipient of the healing is grazed, wounded, or critical. The additional healing increases by an additional 1 point at caster level 6th, and every 6 caster levels thereafter.

Endurance

Harsh conditions or long exertions do not easily tire you.

Benefit: You reduce the penalty from being grazed, wounded, or critical by 1 (to -0, -1, and -2, respectively). In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on the following checks and saves: Swim checks to resist nonlethal damage from exhaustion, Constitution checks to continue running, Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage from a forced march, Constitution checks to hold your breath, Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage from starvation or thirst, Fortitude saves to avoid nonlethal damage from hot or cold environments, and Fortitude saves to resist damage from suffocation. You can sleep in light or medium armor without becoming fatigued.

Normal: A character without this feat who sleeps in medium or heavier armor is fatigued the next day.

Twist the Knife (Combat)

You're especially dangerous against enemies who are suffering from injuries.

Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls against grazed, wounded, or critical enemies.
