In-world continuity and stories from a setting's history are usually a GM's darling-and sheer boredom for the players. No one wants to hear the GM drone on about events from centuries ago, or the complex relationships of NPCs, or elements of the setting's culture that have nothing to do with the adventure at hand. This historical material is justified only in two particular cases: <ul><li>When the players ask about it or show interest </li><li>When it's relevant to the adventure</li></ul> In the second case, relevant doesn't mean "the GM thought it was interesting." The lore actually needs to matter in the present day, and help a player make a decision at some point in the adventure. If the backstory never matters to the adventure outcome, then it's best ignored.
