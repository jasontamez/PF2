The poison track simulates the progressive effects of poison in the body. A character who is poisoned rolls a saving throw after the listed onset at the listed frequency. On an initial exposure to poison, regardless of whether her save succeeds, a victim takes an amount of poison damage equal to the poison's DC - 10, divided by 2 (for example, 5 points of poison damage for a DC 20 poison). This is hit point damage, not ability damage. If a victim is exposed to additional doses of the same poison, a failed save progresses the poison track by one step and increases the duration by 50%, but doesn't increase the DC.

Healthy-Weakened-Impaired'Staggered-Immobile-Dead



Weakened: A character weakened by Strength poison suffers a -2 penalty on Strength-based attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Her carrying capacity is divided by 3. She is always considered to be carrying at least a medium load.

Impaired: A character impaired by Strength poison experiences rapid muscle atrophy. She takes an additional -2 penalty on the affected Strength-based rolls, and is always considered to be carrying at least a heavy load. Staggered: A character staggered by Strength poison is so weakened that she suffers the effects of the staggered condition (except she can take a full-round action if it is purely mental).

Immobile: A character rendered immobile by Strength poison cannot move her body at all. She is helpless and can take only purely mental actions.

Dead: All the character's muscles cease functioning, including the heart.

Healthy-Weakened-Impaired-Pliable-Catatonic-Dead



Weakened: A character whose sense of self is weakened by Charisma poison takes a -2 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks and ability checks. A character with spellcasting based on Charisma decreases his DCs by 2 and can no longer cast his highest level of spells.

Impaired: A character impaired by Charisma poison doesn't add his Charisma bonus to the number of uses per day of pools and abilities (such as lay on hands) and doesn't gain bonus spells per day from his Charisma. He takes an additional -2 penalty on the above Charisma-based rolls. A Charisma-based caster reduces his DCs by an additional 2, and can no longer cast his 2 highest levels of spells.

Pliable: A character rendered pliable by Charisma poison has little sense of self and will go along with nearly anything. Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks automatically succeed against a pliable character, except Diplomacy checks to improve a pliable character's attitude, which have the normal DC. This still does not allow characters to whom the pliable character is unfriendly or hostile to make requests of the pliable character using Diplomacy.

Catatonic: A character rendered catatonic by Charisma poison can see, hear, and process his environment, but has lost all agency and can't interact with the world in any way.

Dead: The character loses even autonomic functions, and dies.
