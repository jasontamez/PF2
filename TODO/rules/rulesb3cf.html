A settlement's population is left to the GM to assign, but you can use a settlement's type to help you determine just how many folks live in the city. Since the actual number of people who dwell in a settlement has no impact on game play, the number you choose is largely cosmetic-feel free to adjust the suggested values below to fit your campaign. <table class="inner"><tr><td>Settlement Type</td><td>Population Range</td></tr><tr><td>Thorp</td><td>Fewer than 20</td></tr><tr><td>Hamlet</td><td>21-60</td></tr><tr><td>Village</td><td>61-200</td></tr><tr><td>Small town</td><td>201-2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Large town</td><td>2,001-5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Small city</td><td>5,001-10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Large city</td><td>10,001-25,000</td></tr><tr><td>Metropolis</td><td>MOre than 25,000</td></tr></table>
