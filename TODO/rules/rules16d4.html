Monsters with high Dexterity tend to take quick combat options, many of which increase mobility.

Accuracy: Increase the monster's attack bonuses by 2.

Combat Reflexes: The monster can make up to five attacks of opportunity each round, and can make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed.

Deflect Projectiles: When not flat-footed, the monster deflects one ranged attack per round.

Dodge Expert: Increase the monster's AC by 2 and its touch AC by 4. Decrease its flat-footed AC by 6.

Evasion: When the monster succeeds on a Reflex saving throw against an effect that normally deals half damage on a successful save, the monster instead takes no damage. At CR 8, it also takes only half damage if it fails its save.

Extra Attack: The monster gains one additional melee or ranged attack at its highest bonus, but reduces its attack bonus by 2 with all attacks of that type. Use this option for monsters that use two-weapon fighting.

Far Shot: Double all the monster's range increments and reduce the monster's penalties on ranged attacks from range increments by half.

Fast Reload: The monster can reload a ranged weapon that normally takes a move or standard action to reload as a free action. When it reloads a ranged weapon, it doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

Firearm Savvy: The monster's firearm attacks target touch AC when firing beyond the first range increment. As a move action, the monster can remove the broken condition from a firearm caused by a misfire.

Improved Initiative: Increase the monster's initiative bonus by 4.

Mobile Attack: The monster can move its speed and make an attack (either melee or ranged, chosen when the monster gains this option) at any point during its movement as a full-round action. The monster can use this ability with any of its movement modes.

Mobility: The monster gains a +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity.

Mounted Master: The monster deals double damage on a mounted charge, halves its penalties on ranged attacks for being mounted, and grants its mount a +4 bonus to AC.

Precise Shot: When making a ranged attack, the monster ignores the -4 penalty for attacking an opponent engaged in melee as well as the target's AC bonuses from cover and concealment (except total cover or total concealment).

Swap Places: The monster can swap positions with an adjacent ally as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Uncanny Dodge: The monster can't be caught flat-footed.

Whirlwind Attack: The monster can make an attack against each creature within reach at its highest attack bonus as a full attack.
