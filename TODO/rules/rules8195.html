For a grittier game in which wounds have a much larger impact, double the penalties imposed by the grazed, wounded, and critical conditions. Use this mode carefully, since it can cause a serious death spiral-in other words, the side that starts losing has tremendous disadvantages and is far more likely to die or need to escape. This adjustment also means that a spellcaster will always lose a level of spells she can cast when she drops from one wound threshold to a lower one, so the effects of wound thresholds on spellcasting are more predictable and stay consistent whether a character is at an even or odd level.
