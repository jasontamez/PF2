If your solar system has multiple worlds, the next question is how beings can travel between them.

Portals: Perhaps the easiest method to manage from a GM perspective, magical or scientific portals between worlds allow players to transport themselves to locations chosen by the GM, giving her natural adventure hooks and allowing her to keep a tight rein on interplanetary travel.

Vessels: Whether powered by magic or science, spaceships add a whole new flavor to a game. Do your starships operate via massive thrusters or diaphanous sails that catch the sun's light? Do they fold space and time, or are they giant space-faring creatures that passengers stow away inside like Jonah and the whale? And does it take days, years, or generations for the vessel to reach another world?

Spells: Teleportation spells are important to consider when establishing extraplanetary locations. Can a wizard simply cast <a href="spelldisplayad68.html?ItemName=greater%20teleport">greater teleport</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a>, or is more required to reach the stars? Be warned that easy access to the galaxy brings a host of concerns'such as why, if interplanetary travel is easy, aliens aren't thronging your base world.
