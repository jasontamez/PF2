Though spontaneous casters can use this system, they gain relatively little, since they already don't need to select which spells to prepare in advance, and their spell slots are comparable in number to those they would have if they used a spell pool.

This system doesn't apply to spellcasters such as paladins and rangers, who gain only 1st- to 4th-level spells, since they have so few spell slots that they don't run into the same problems other spellcasters do.
