Elemental Vulnerability (-2 RP): Prerequisite: Outsider (native) with ties to an elemental plane; Weakness: Pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Members of this race have vulnerability to the chosen energy type. They cannot posses any racial trait that grants them resistance or immunity to this energy type. Special: This trait can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, choose a different energy type. If a race has vulnerability to fire and immunity to cold, it gains the cold subtype. If a race has vulnerability to cold and immunity to fire, it gains the fire subtype.

Sunlight Powerlessness (-2 RP): Prerequisite: Halfundead subtype or undead type; Weakness: Members of this race are powerless in natural sunlight (this does not include light created by effects such as a <a href="spelldisplay0c31.html?ItemName=daylight">daylight</a> spell). A member of this race caught in natural sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.
