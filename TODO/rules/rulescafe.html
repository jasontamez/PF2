Quasi deities are the least powerful of the divine, and the most eclectic in their nature. A quasi deity has a stat block, and can be of any CR (although the vast majority lie in the CR 21-25 range). Nascent demon lords, the malebranche, and qlippoth lords are all examples of quasi deities, as are creatures like <a href="monsterdisplay89e8.html?ItemName=Deep%20One,%20Elder">deep one elders</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay802e.html?ItemName=Conqueror%20Worm">conqueror worms</a>, and <a href="monsterdisplay9fa8.html?ItemName=Green%20Men">green men</a>, who have the ability to grant spells to clerics. Mythic characters who take the <a href="pathabilities61d3.html?Path=Universal">divine source path ability</a> are also quasi deities.

Quasi deities have no inborn ability to shape and alter reality by thought alone, even if they somehow gain control of a planar realm, and must rely upon their own abilities and magic to effect changes of this nature.

A quasi deity grants from one to four domains to its clerics.
