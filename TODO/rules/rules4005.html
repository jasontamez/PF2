Climb (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have a climb speed of 20 feet, and gain the +8 racial bonus on Climb checks that a climb speed normally grants.

Darklands Stalker (4 RP): Prerequisite: Native to the Darklands; Benefit: Members of this race can move unhindered through difficult terrain while underground. In addition, members of this race with a Dexterity score of 13 or higher gain <a href="featdisplayc15b.html?ItemName=Nimble%20Moves">Nimble Moves</a> as a bonus feat.

Fleet-Footed (3 RP): Prerequisite: The race has at least a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity; Benefit: Members of this race receive <a href="featdisplay1c6f.html?ItemName=Run">Run</a> as a bonus feat and a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks.

Gliding Wings (3 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race take no damage from falling (as if subject to a constant nonmagical feather fall spell). While in midair, members of this race can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot they fall, at a speed of 60 feet per round. A member of a race with gliding wings cannot gain height with these wings alone; it merely coasts in other directions as it falls. If subjected to a strong wind or any other effect that causes a creature with gliding wings to rise, it can take advantage of the updraft to increase the distance it can glide.

Jumper (2 RP): Prerequisite: The race has at least a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity; Benefit: Members of this race are always considered to have a running start when making Acrobatics checks to jump.

Mountaineer (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race are immune to altitude sickness and do not lose their Dexterity bonus to AC when making Climb checks or Acrobatics checks to cross narrow or slippery surfaces.

Sprinter (1 RP): Prerequisite: Normal speed; Benefit: Members of this race gain a +10 foot racial bonus to their speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw actions.

Swift as Shadows (3 RP): Prerequisite: The race has at least a +2 racial bonus to Dexterity; Benefit: Members of this race reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving at full speed by 5, and reduce the Stealth check penalty for sniping by 10.

Swim (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have a swim speed of 30 feet and gain the +8 racial bonus on Swim checks that a swim speed normally grants.

Terrain Stride (1 RP): Prerequisite: Normal speed; Benefit: Choose a ranger favored terrain type. Members of this race can move through natural difficult terrain at their normal speed while within the chosen terrain. Magically altered terrain affects them normally.

Vestigial Wings (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have wings that do not provide the lift required for actual flight, but do have enough power to aid flight attained by some other method, and grant a +4 racial bonus on Fly checks.
