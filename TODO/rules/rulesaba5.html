Each challenge the PCs face represents a setback or opportunity in the magic item creation process. This system assumes that the PCs involved are gathering exotic ingredients, searching through the notes of others who have crafted similar items, and dealing with unexpected mystical variables. It allows the entire party to participate, so anyone who wishes to help counts as a creator, and only one creator needs to have the required item creation feat.

Each challenge presents two tasks. One creator can choose a single task to attempt, or two creators can each choose to do a different task. This choice of tasks to attempt must be made before rolling any associated checks. Creators can't take 10 or 20 (even with bardic knowledge or skill mastery) or benefit from aid another on item creation tasks.

Some tasks don't require checks, but present other conditions for success. If a creator takes on such a task, it must be completed before attempting a task that involves a check.

If the creators decide to attempt both tasks for a given challenge, each task must be attempted by a different creator. For instance, when faced with a sesquipedalian elucidation challenge (see page 185), a wizard might pull out his dictionary and attempt a Linguistics check, while a rogue might choose to make up her own big words and attempt a Use Magic Device check. The number of tasks attempted and their success or failure determines the outcome of the challenge, as detailed below.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>One Task Attempted</td><td>Both Tasks Attempted</td><td>Challenge Result</td></tr> <tr><td>-</td><td>Succeed at both</td><td>Critical success</td></tr> <tr><td>Succeed</td><td>Succeed at one and fail the other by less than 5</td><td>Success</td></tr> <tr><td>Fail</td><td>Succeed at one and fail the other by 5 or more</td><td>Failure</td></tr> <tr><td>-</td><td>Fail both</td><td>Critical failure</td></tr> </table>

The stat block for a challenge includes a short description and the following sections.

Tasks: These are the options a creator can choose from when trying to complete the challenge. They contain only short titles, and the GM should interpret the specifics in an interesting way that makes sense based on the story.

Results: These entries cover the consequences of success or failure. Use the results from only one category; a critical success doesn't also give the benefits of a normal success, and a critical failure doesn't also impose the effects of a normal failure.
