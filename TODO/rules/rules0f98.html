Spells from magic items use the same rules as above. That means a <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a> cast from a wand created by a sorcerer or wizard has the same save DC and amount of damage dice as a <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a> cast by any sorcerer or wizard. When calculating the base cost or price of a magic item, always use the minimum CL as defined by this system (even if the item's creator would have had a higher caster level). Potions and scrolls always default to the appropriate cleric, druid, or wizard spell level to determine their base costs.
