The benefit of many low-level conjuration spells is that they grant a wider range of versatility, letting the characters focus the spending of their hard-earned gold on items with effects that can't be replicated, rather than on mundane equipment.

<a href="spelldisplay7df2.html?ItemName=Create%20Food%20and%20Water">Create Food and Water</a>: As a 3rd-level cleric spell, <a href="spelldisplay16cb.html?ItemName=create%20food%20and%20water">create food and water</a> is one of the most obvious choices for those looking to bypass some of the rigors of wilderness survival. The Survival skill often eclipses the worth of this spell, as succeeding at a simple DC 10 check allows for a character to provide food and water for herself without needing to expend a 3rd-level spell slot. At 5th level, it's not unlikely that a party member can regularly succeed at the DC 16 Survival check required to feed himself and three other party members. Imposing heavy penalties on Survival checks to get along in the wild is one way of making <a href="spelldisplay16cb.html?ItemName=create%20food%20and%20water">create food and water</a> more valuable, and such adjustments are entirely appropriate in wasteland environments.

There are several other ways to prolong the usefulness of <a href="spelldisplay16cb.html?ItemName=create%20food%20and%20water">create food and water</a>. Armed with knowledge that the party will be entering a particularly inhospitable region, characters might want to stock up on conjured food and water. Repeated castings of <a href="spelldisplay16cb.html?ItemName=create%20food%20and%20water">create food and water</a> can provide numerous meals, and by spending a few days, a party can create a stockpile of rations for a trip. Combined with the fact that <a href="spelldisplay073e.html?ItemName=purify%20food%20and%20water">purify food and water</a> can be cast an unlimited number of times per day, stockpiling food and drink with these castings is an economically savvy way of saving both gold and hunting time.

<a href="spelldisplaye2fa.html?ItemName=Mount">Mount</a> and <a href="spelldisplayad81.html?ItemName=Phantom%20Steed">Phantom Steed</a>: Few wilderness areas are entirely amenable to or completely inhospitable to mounts. Open groves and wildlife paths where mounts can roam free crisscross dense forests, while deserts often contain escarpments of jagged rocks that confound the most sure footed of creatures. The mutable nature of these wilderness regions makes the ability to summon a temporary mount particularly helpful. For routine journeys, <a href="spelldisplayea09.html?ItemName=mount">mount</a> can conjure a single mount for a character or be repeatedly cast to provide mounts for a whole party. Higher-level spellcasters benefit more from <a href="spelldisplay1cee.html?ItemName=phantom%20steed">phantom steed</a>, especially at 8th level, when the steed starts gaining extra movement-related abilities.

<a href="spelldisplayf956.html?ItemName=Neutralize%20Poison">Neutralize Poison</a>: First accessible by low-level druids, <a href="spelldisplay3bc2.html?ItemName=neutralize%20poison">neutralize poison</a> is useful as both a method of healing poison and a means to prevent poisoning from occurring in the first place. Using the spell as a means of detoxifying a creature is its most efficient application, since one casting of the spell prevents that creature from poisoning targets at all. It's also possible to use this spell to remove a poison applied to an object or from food or drink. The use of <a href="spelldisplay3bc2.html?ItemName=neutralize%20poison">neutralize poison</a> in this manner doesn't guarantee success, and it can be interesting to keep the DC of the targeted poison unknown, leaving the efficacy of a given casting in question.

At a cost of 11,250 gp, a <a href="spelldisplay3bc2.html?ItemName=neutralize%20poison">wand of neutralize poison</a> makes for a practical, if unusual, weapon. When added into the arsenal of mobile melee classes, specifically those with ranks in Use Magic Device or supplementary spellcaster levels, such wands can be used to disable the poisons of wilderness-dwelling creatures. The forfeiture of an attack in order to strike a foe with a poison-neutralizing wand could mean the difference between life and death for a character who is facing repeated applications of poison.
