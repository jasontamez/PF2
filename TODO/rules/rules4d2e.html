Effect words determine the overall outcome of a wordspell. A wordspell can contain more than one effect word, and it is possible for their effects to counteract one another. Effect words use the following format.

Name: This is the name of the effect word. Each word belongs to a group of similar words, noted in parentheses. Unless otherwise noted, an individual wordspell cannot contain two effect words from the same group.

School: This entry lists the school of magic that the effect word belongs to.

Level: This entry lists the classes that can learn the effect word and what level the word is for members of that class. Note that an individual wordspell can contain no words of a level higher than the wordspell.

Duration: This line lists the duration of the effect word.

Saving Throw: If the effect allows a saving throw, it is noted here along with the effect of a successful save.

Spell Resistance: If the effect word allows spell resistance, it is noted here.

Target Restrictions: Some effect words can only be combined with specific target words when arranging wordspells. If this is the case, the specific target words are noted here.

Description: This paragraph describes the effects of the word when arranged in a wordspell.

Boost: If the effect word can be boosted by the boost meta word, the effects are listed here. See the meta word section for more details.

<a href="rules953e.html?Name=Acid%20Words&amp;Category=Effect%20Word%20Descriptions">Acid Words</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 167</a>
These words create caustic acid that scorches and burns all that it comes in contact with.



Acid Burn (Acid)


School conjuration (creation) [acid]; Level druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Reflex half; Spell Resistance no

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d3 points of acid damage. If the wordspell has only a single target, it requires a melee or ranged touch attack to hit and does not allow a saving throw.



Corrosive Bolt (Acid)


School conjuration (creation) [acid]; Level magus 2, sorcerer/ wizard 2
Duration 2 rounds
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions selected

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d4 points of acid damage per level of the wordcaster (maximum 5d4). On the following round, the target takes this damage again. Hitting a target with a wordspell with this effect word requires a ranged touch attack.



Acid Wave (Acid)


School conjuration (creation) [acid]; Level magus 4, sorcerer/ wizard 4
Duration 1 round/level (see text)
Saving Throw Reflex half and partial (see below); Spell Resistance no

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Targets damaged by this effect word are sickened for 1 round per caster level, or 1 round if the saving throw against the wordspell with this effect word was successful.



Caustic Cloud (Acid)


School conjuration (creation) [acid]; Level sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 6
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Fortitude half; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions burst

A wordspell with this effect word creates a cloud of noxious green vapor that obscures vision. Creatures caught in the cloud take 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and are fatigued. Creatures caught in the cloud receive a Fortitude save to halve the damage and to negate the fatigued effect. Creatures that remain in the cloud take a cumulative -2 penalty on the save each round they remain in the cloud, but spending just 1 round outside the cloud's area resets this penalty. Creatures in the cloud that are fatigued become exhausted on a failed saving throw. A strong wind, such as that created by a <a href="spelldisplayba00.html?ItemName=gust%20of%20wind">gust of wind</a>, disperses this cloud immediately.

When a wordspell with this effect word is cast, the wordcaster selects one alignment: good, evil, chaotic, or lawful. The target of this wordspell is protected from that alignment and receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC on attacks made from creatures of that alignment and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws made on spells and effects from creatures of that alignment. The target of a wordspell with this effect word can choose to end this effect as an immediate action to reroll any one saving throw made against a spell or effect from the chosen alignment, but must take the second result, even if it is worse.



Alignment Assault (Alignment)


School evocation; Level cleric 5, inquisitor 5, paladin 4
Duration instantaneous, see text
Saving Throw Will partial; Spell Resistance yes

All creatures of that alignment take 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 8d8). Outsiders of that alignment take 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). In addition, creatures of the affected alignment are staggered for 1 round per caster level if they fail their saving throws.

School abjuration; Level cleric 8
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)

Boost: A wordspell with this effect word can be cast as an immediate action. In this case, the effect lasts until the end of your next turn.

Force Shield (Armor)


School abjuration; Level alchemist 1, magus 1, sorcerer/ wizard 1, summoner 1, witch 1
Duration 1 minute/level

Lock Ward (Binding)


School abjuration; Level sorcerer/wizard 1
Duration permanent
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
Target Restrictions selected

This effect word causes one unattended object to close, such as a door, chest, or book. If the object possesses a lock, the object is also locked. If the wordspell includes other effect words, the effects of those words are suspended until a creature other than the wordcaster attempts to unlock or otherwise open the object. That creature becomes the target of the other effect words, as if those effect words had the selected target word. Only consider the other effect words when determining the duration of this secondary effect.

This effect word functions as the paralyze humanoid word except that it can affect creatures of any type and the duration is permanent. A creature affected by a wordspell with this effect word receives one additional Will saving throw at the end of its first turn after initially failing the save.

Cold Snap (Cold)


School evocation [cold]; Level druid 0, magus 0, sorcerer/ wizard 0
Duration instantaneous

A Fortitude save halves this damage and negates the Dexterity damage. Creatures immune to cold damage do not take the Dexterity damage. Because of the heavy snow and winds, visibility is reduced to 5 feet inside the blizzard. Effects that deal fire damage do not harm anyone inside this blizzard unless they are of a level equal to or higher than the wordspell with this effect word.

If the creature is attacked by the caster or his allies, this effect immediately ends (though other effects of the wordspell may continue). A wordspell with this effect word only affects creatures of the humanoid type; targets receive a +4 bonus on the saving throw if a wordspell with the effect word has its target boosted to affect more than one creature.



Simple Order (Command)


School enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind affecting]; Level bard 1, cleric 1, inquisitor 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1
Duration 1 round
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions selected

The target of a wordspell with this effect word must follow one of five simple commands to the best of its ability on its next turn. If the target cannot take the specified action on its next turn, this effect of the wordspell fails. The possible commands are as follows.

Approach: The target must move toward the caster as quickly and directly as possible, provoking attacks of opportunity as normal. The target avoids obvious hazards, such as fire, pits, or traps that it is aware of (other creatures do not count).

Drop: The target drops whatever it is holding and does not pick up anything this round. It can otherwise act normally.

Fall: The target falls to the ground and remains prone until its next turn. It can otherwise act normally.

Flee: The target moves away from the caster as quickly and directly as possible. This otherwise functions as approach.

Halt: The target does not move and takes no other action on its turn, although it is not considered flat-footed or helpless.

Rumble (Destruction)


School evocation [earth]; Level cleric 8, druid 8
Duration 1 round
Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions burst (emanation)

This effect word causes the ground within the area to shake and rumble, like an earthquake. Each creature in the area must make a Reflex save or be knocked prone and take 8d6 points of damage. If the creature makes its save, it takes half damage and is not knocked prone. Caves, cliffs, tunnels, and other natural surfaces collapse in this area, triggering a landslide and possibly burying creatures underneath. Structures take 100 points of damage from this effect, typically enough to cause wooden and masonry buildings to collapse, but not stone or reinforced masonry buildings. See page 429 of the Core Rulebook for more information on landslides and collapses.

Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions burst (emanation)

This effect word causes heavy clouds to form in the sky above the area of wordspell with this effect word. The area is pelted by heavy rain and hail, obscuring vision and making ranged attacks impossible. Melee attacks take a 20% miss chance. Creatures in the area take 4d6 points of damage from pounding hail at the start of their turn. In addition, the caster can call down a bolt of lightning once per turn that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level. The caster can split this bolt to hit as many targets as she likes and can divide the damage dice up among the targets as she sees fit. The targets receive a Reflex save to halve the damage. Targets that fail are also knocked prone by the force of the blast. The ground in the area of a wordspell with this effect word is considered difficult terrain for the duration, but not for the caster.

Detection words are used to learn things that simple observation cannot. They reveal secrets and uncover hidden things. Detection words are special in that they can be combined with other words from the Detection group in the same wordspell. Detection words cannot be combined with any other group's effect words within the same wordspell.



Sense Magic (Detection)


School divination; Level bard 0, cleric 0, druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0, witch 0
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions cone

A wordspell with this effect word detects magic auras. By concentrating each round, the caster can determine the number and location of each aura in the target area. He can make a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the school of each aura (one check per aura, the DC of this check is 15 + the spell level or 15 + 1/2 the caster level for a nonspell effect). If the aura radiates from a magic item, the caster can attempt to identify the item's properties as if using <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> (see Spellcraft). If the aura emanates from a spell of 7th level or higher, or is a nonspell effect with a caster level of 12th or higher, the caster knows that the aura is strong, even if the Knowledge check to identify the school is unsuccessful.



Sense Alignment (Detection)


School divination; Level cleric 1, inquisitor 1, paladin 1
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions cone

This effect word detects one or more alignments. When cast, the wordcaster selects one of the following alignments: chaos, evil, good, or law. By concentrating, he can sense the presence and source of that alignment in the wordspell area. If the source is a creature with more than 25 Hit Dice, an outsider, cleric, or paladin with more than 4 Hit Dice, or a magic item or spell with a caster level greater than 16th, the caster knows that aura is strong.

Boost: The caster can select two alignments to detect. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.

Boost: The caster can detect all four alignments (although this does not allow him to detect neutral objects or creatures). Boosting this effect word increases its level by 2.



Sense Thoughts (Detection)


School divination; Level alchemist 2, bard 2, inquisitor 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2, witch 2
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions cone

This effect word allows the caster to detect the surface thoughts of creatures in the target area. By focusing on one creature in the area, the caster can read the surface thoughts of that creature. The caster must be otherwise aware of the creature to focus on it. A Will save prevents the caster from reading the creature's thoughts for the duration of a wordspell with this effect word. If the target has an Intelligence score at least 10 higher than the caster and it makes its Will save, the target can instead read the surface thoughts of the caster for the duration of the of the wordspell with this effect word, while the wordcaster receives no insight. Each round, the caster can focus on a new creature if he desires.



Sense Hidden (Detection)


School divination; Level alchemist 2, bard 2, cleric 2, inquisitor 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2, witch 2
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)

Boost: The caster can see through illusions, see the true form of polymorphed creatures and objects, and locate creatures protected by spells and effects that grant concealment. The caster also receives a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against illusion spells and effects. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 4.

Duration 1 minute/level

Target Restrictions selected

The caster of a wordspell with this effect word selects one spell effect that affects a willing target. The caster must then make a caster level check with a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spell effect. If successful, that spell effect is suppressed for the duration of this spell. If the suppressed spell has a limited duration, that duration continues to expire while this spell is in effect.

Boost: The caster can target creatures that are not willing. The targets receive a saving throw to negate this effect word, and the caster must overcome the target's spell resistance. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.



Resist Arcana (Dispelling)

Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Will partial; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions selected

The caster of a wordspell with this effect word unravels all of the magic effects affecting the target of the wordspell with this effect word. The caster must make a caster level check. The result of this check is compared to the caster level + 11 of every spell affecting the target. If successful, that spell effect immediately ends. The target can make a Will saving throw. If successful, this wordspell only attempts to unmake the highest-level spell affecting the target.



Negation (Dispelling)


School abjuration; Level cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 6
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions burst

This effect word creates an area in which magic does not function. All magic effects are suppressed while inside the area. As a result, this word cannot be combined with other effect words. Magic effects cannot cross through the area. Time spent within the field counts against the duration of the suppressed effects. Summoned and incorporeal creatures cannot enter the area and are immediately forced to the nearest edge if inside the area when it forms. Objects still maintain their function while in the area, so a sword still cuts, even if it loses its magical properties.

School divination; Level bard 0, druid 0, ranger 1
Duration 1 hour/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions personal

When a wordspell with this effect word is cast, the exact location of the caster becomes a fixed point. For the duration of the wordspell, the caster always knows the direction and distance to the point where this wordspell was cast. If this word is cast again, the original casting immediately ends. This effect does not instruct the caster on how to reach the point, but rather merely indicates the direction to the point, even if that direction leads through solid objects and other hazards.



Far Sight (Divination)


School divination (scrying); Level bard 3, cleric 3, druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3
Duration 1 minute/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions personal

The caster of a wordspell with this effect word creates an invisible eye at any point within 400 feet + 40 feet per caster level. This sensor cannot move, but for the duration of the wordspell, the caster can look through this eye as if it were her own. The eye uses her senses, including magical ones, to allow her to see, including darkvision, low-light vision, or other effects, such as sense magic. The eye can view in all directions and cannot be destroyed if discovered.

Boost: This sensor can be placed anywhere on the same plane of existence as the caster, with no limit to range. The caster can place it to within 10 feet of a creature that is known to the caster, but the target gets a Will save to negate the effect in this case and the caster must overcome the target's spell resistance. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 2.



Locate (Divination)


School divination; Level bard 6, cleric 6, druid 6, inquisitor 6, witch 6
Duration 10 minutes/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions personal

The caster of a wordspell with this effect word can name any location she has visited before or any object she has held before. For the duration of this wordspell, she always knows the direction of the named location or object. The direction is always the swiftest path to travel, leading her perfectly through mazes or other obstacles by the method the wordcaster is currently traveling, irrespective of danger.

Unfetter (Gravity)


School transmutation; Level druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 6
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions selected

This effect word makes the bonds of gravity work in reverse for the targets, causing them to fall up for the duration. They treat up as down and down as up. This can cause the creatures to take falling damage when they hit the ceiling or another surface above them. This effect applies to the targets and all of their gear, so long as it remains on their person. Thrown and missile weapons interact with gravity normally, but the disorientation caused by unfetter means the target takes a -4 penalty on such attacks. When a wordspell with this effect word ends, the targets fall to the ground unless they have some means of staying aloft.



Repulse (Gravity)

This effect word creates an area of impossible gravity, where all creatures and objects not securely fastened to the ground fall away from the center of the burst, to its exterior edge. Creatures inside the area when it forms are immediately moved toward its nearest edge. If, because of an obstacle, they cannot reach the edge, they strike the barrier and take falling damage. While a wordspell with this effect word persists, objects cannot enter the area unless they possess the ability to fly. Any flying creatures that rely on wings and enter the area must immediately make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be repelled by the area, unable to enter this turn. Missile weapons that pass through this area automatically miss their target. The caster is immune to this effect and may enter the area freely.

Boost: The caster may designate a number of creatures equal to his level that are not affected by the wordspell.

Echo (Illusion)


School illusion (figment); Level bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw Will disbelief; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions burst (emanation)

This effect word targets a single location, creating a sound that rises, recedes, or remains constant for the duration. The sound's volume increases with the caster's level. The base Perception DC to notice this sound is 0, but the DC is reduced by 1 per caster level (although it can be higher if the caster desires). This means that the sound starts out as loud as a creature talking, but by 10th level, it is as loud as creatures engaged in a noisy battle. The sound can resemble anything the caster desires, except it cannot replicate speech or language. Once cast, the type of sound within the emanation cannot be changed.

This illusion only contains visual elements, and while it can move, its movements are repeated once per round. It can otherwise have any appearance the caster desires. The caster can change the illusion's movements by concentrating, but it cannot leave its initial area.

Target Restrictions personal

The target of a wordspell with this effect word can read text written in one particular language, including the language of magic. The caster picks the language when the wordspell is cast. For the duration, the target can read that language as if fluent in it.

A wordspell with this effect word does not impart the ability to determine what a given language is based on its appearance; the caster must already know the language or guess what language the writing is in to do so.

Spells using these words can restore life to the dead and heal the most serious of afflictions.



Purify (Life)


School conjuration (healing); Level alchemist 4, bard 4, cleric 4, druid 4, inquisitor 4, paladin 4, ranger 4
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
Target Restrictions personal, selected

When a wordspell with this effect word is cast, the wordcaster chooses one type of affliction: curses, diseases, or poisons. The target of a wordspell with this effect word receives a new saving throw to immediately end all such afflictions of the chosen type currently affecting the target. The DC of this save is equal to the original DC of the affliction. The target must roll a saving throw for each affliction individually. If the affliction does not allow a saving throw, this effect word cannot remove that affliction.

Alternatively, a wordspell with this effect word can be used to remove 1d4 temporary negative levels possessed by the target, or 1 permanent negative level.



Revive (Life)


School conjuration (healing); Level cleric 5, druid 5, witch 5
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
Target Restrictions selected

This effect word restores life to a living creature that has died within up to 1 hour per caster level. The soul of the target receives a clear image of the caster, and can choose not to return, causing the wordspell to fail. If the soul is willing, the target does not receive a saving throw.

The target is restored to life with 1 hit point, unless another effect word adds to this total. In addition, the target loses 50% of any prepared spells or spell slots it had before it died (determined randomly). Coming back from the dead in this way is an ordeal, and the target gains three permanent negative levels from the experience (if the target does not have at least 4 Hit Dice, a wordspell with this effect word has no effect).

While this effect word undoes any mortal wounds the target might possess, its body must otherwise be whole for the effect word to function. Any missing parts are still missing when the creature is restored. Normal poisons and diseases are cured as well, but magical afflictions remain. Undead creatures are unaffected by a wordspell with this effect word, as are the dead bodies of creatures that were undead. Constructs and outsiders cannot be restored to life by this effect word. Targets that died as a result of old age cannot be restored to life by this effect word.



Life Touch (Life)


School conjuration (healing); Level cleric 8, witch 8
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
Target Restrictions selected

This effect word functions as revive, but it can be used on a creature that has been dead for up to 1 day per caster level. The creature is restored with half its original hit points, and its body does not need to be whole (just a piece of the creature is required). Any parts of the creature that were missing before its death are not restored by this effect word. The creature gains only one permanent negative level from being restored by this effect word, and this negative level fades after 24 hours (although it can be removed early as normal). The creature retains all of the prepared spells and slots it had when it died.

Wall words create large barriers that impede and harm those who pass through them.

School evocation [air]; Level cleric 3, druid 3, magus 3, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions barrier

This effect word creates a vertical wall of swirling wind. This wind does not obscure sight, but missile weapons that pass through the wall automatically miss (with the exception of large missiles, such as giant-thrown rocks and siege weapons). Creatures that pass through the wall treat it as difficult terrain and must make a DC 10 Strength check. Failure indicates that the creature cannot pass through the wall this round, but may try again in future rounds. Gases, gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall.



Fire Wall (Wall)


School evocation [fire]; Level druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/ wizard 4, summoner 4
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Reflex half; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions barrier

This effect word creates a vertical wall of crackling flame. Creatures in the space of the wall when it forms or that attempt to pass through the wall take 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per level of the wordcaster (maximum +20). A Reflex save halves this damage. The wall blocks line of sight.



Ice Wall (Wall)


School evocation [cold]; Level druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/ wizard 4, summoner 4
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions barrier

This effect word creates a vertical wall of solid ice. The wall must be a smooth, uninterrupted surface when formed. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level and has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. The wall blocks line of sight.



Stone Wall (Wall)


School conjuration (creation); Level cleric 5, druid 6, magus 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 5
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions barrier

This effect word creates a vertical wall of solid stone. The wall must be a smooth, uninterrupted surface when formed. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level, has hardness 8, and has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. The wall blocks line of sight.



Blade Wall (Wall)


School conjuration (creation); Level cleric 6, summoner 5
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Reflex half; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions barrier

This effect word creates a vertical wall of whirling blades that deals 1d6 points of damage per level to any creature that comes in contact with it. If a creature is in the area of the wall when it forms, that creature can make a Reflex save to avoid the damage entirely. Creatures that pass through the wall can make a Reflex save to halve the damage. Regardless of the outcome of their roll, they still move through the wall. This wall provides cover to creatures on the other side, but does not block line of sight.

Fog Bank (Weather)


School conjuration (creation); Level cleric 1, druid 1, sorcerer/ wizard 1, witch 1
Duration 1 minute/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions barrier, burst (emanation)

This effect word creates a thick fog in its area of effect. It obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, whereas creatures farther away have total concealment. A moderate wind or fire effect removes the fog in the affected area. The fog is stationary.

Boost: If a wordspell with this effect word uses the burst target word, it can be directed to move up to 10 feet each round by the caster as a swift action.



Wind Blast (Weather)


School evocation [air]; Level druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 3
Duration 1 round
Saving Throw Fortitude negates; Spell Resistance yes
Target Restrictions line

This effect word creates a blast of air that can knock over or hinder those in its path. When a wordspell with this effect word is cast, any Large or smaller creature within the area of the wordspell must make a Fortitude save or be knocked prone and pushed back 10 feet. Any creature wishing to move through the line of air must make a DC 20 Strength check. Failure means the creature wastes 5 feet of movement, but is otherwise unhindered and can continue to move (so long as it does not move through the line of air). The DC increases to 30 if the creature attempts to move toward the source of the wind. Flying creatures take a -4 penalty on saves and Strength checks made against this effect.



Blizzard (Weather)


School conjuration (creation); Level druid 3, magus 3, sorcerer/ wizard 3, witch 3
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions burst (emanation)

This effect word causes heavy snow to fall in the area of effect. This provides concealment as the fog bank effect word, but it cannot be removed by wind. In addition, the ground in the area of effect is treated as difficult terrain for the duration and as being very slippery for the purposes of Acrobatics and Climb skill checks.

Boost: Each creature in the area of effect takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round at the end of its turn. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.



Storm Master (Weather)


School transmutation; Level cleric 7, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7
Duration 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Target Restrictions personal

A word spell with this effect word grants the target the ability to alter the weather around it in a 1-mile radius. The target can change the conditions by shifting the weather one step at a time up or down a scale of weather effects. The scale is as follows: freezing cold, blizzard, snow, cold rain, cold wind, calm, warm wind, warm rain, thunderstorm, tornado, extreme heat. Each change takes 10 minutes to fully take effect. Thus if the weather currently features warm wind and the caster wanted to change that to cold wind, she would need to first change the weather to calm, and then to cold wind. The target cannot control the specifics of the weather, merely what type of weather is occurring (the target cannot, for example, make lightning strike a house, but it can cause lighting to strike within the area).

Boost: Each change in the weather takes only 5 minutes.
