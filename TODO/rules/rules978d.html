A supernatural nightmare is similar to a naturally occurring nightmare, but is created deliberately by a malevolent entity. This entity chooses the gravity, size, and shape of the dreamscape, and can also determine the dreamscape's goal and features; the goal must be reasonably accomplished, subject to the GM's discretion. Some supernatural nightmares impose penalties if the goal of the nightmare is not completed, with the most dire cases allowing for death in the dreamscape to cause death in the waking world.

Spells: Certain spells, such as <a href="spelldisplay6407.html?ItemName=nightmare">nightmare</a> or <a href="spelldisplay3f23.html?ItemName=night%20terrors">night terrors</a>, can cause their targets to experience nightmares. A caster of the <a href="spelldisplay6407.html?ItemName=nightmare">nightmare</a> spell can choose to ensnare her target in a nightmare dreamscape instead of allowing her target a Will save to resist the spell. If so, the caster doesn't have much control over the nightmare dreamscape but can ensure the presence of one <a href="rules795c.html?Name=Nightmare%20Feature&amp;Category=Nightmare%20Dreamscapes">nightmare feature</a> per 5 caster levels. The caster doesn't select which nightmare features the target experiences. If the target fails to accomplish the goal of the nightmare, it suffers the spell's effects.
