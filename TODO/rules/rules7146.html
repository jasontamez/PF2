Most of these abilities grant more spellcasting abilities or reflect the monster's deep understanding or clever manipulation of magical forces.

At-Will Magic: Choose one spell of 0 or 1st level that does not heal damage. The monster can cast this spell at will.

Contingent Spell: Choose one spell of the monster's CR band or lower (see <a href="rules37a1.html?Name=Spell%20Lists&amp;Category=Step%206:%20Spells">Spell Lists</a>). This spell comes into effect on the monster under a particular condition you specify (such as "when an enemy attempts to attack the monster" or "when the monster is targeted by an enchantment spell"). This ability can trigger once per day. The spell chosen is in addition to any spells the monster gains from being a spellcaster or having the secondary magic option (see <a href="rules6c9e.html?Name=Universal%20Options&amp;Category=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options">Universal Options</a>).

Dimensional Steps: As a standard action, the monster teleports to an open space it can see within 150 feet of it.

Incorporeal Form: Once per day, this monster gains the <a href="rulesa403.html?Name=Monstrous&amp;Category=Combat%20Options">incorporeal option</a> for 1 minute.

Magical Aptitude: When attempting a Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Metamagic Spell: Choose one <a href="featsc9d0.html?Category=Metamagic">metamagic feat</a> and one spell the monster knows. That spell gains the benefit of the chosen metamagic feat once per day.

Mutagen: Choose one of the following benefits: <ul><li>The monster's AC, Reflex save bonus, ranged attack bonus, and Dexterity modifier each increase by 2. Its Wisdom modifier decreases by 2. </li><li>The monster's melee attack bonus, melee damage rolls, and Strength modifier each increase by 2. Its Intelligence modifier decreases by 2. </li><li>The monster's Fortitude save bonus and Constitution modifier by each increase by 2, and its hit points increase by an amount equal to double its CR. Its Charisma modifier decreases by 2.</li></ul>Spontaneous Casting: The monster can spontaneously replace its normal spells with spells of the same level of a particular type. Choose cure spells, inflict spells, summon nature's ally spells, or any type of spell that has one spell per level in a similar fashion. Spontaneously casting a spell in this way uses up the daily use of a spell. A monster must have the spellcaster array to gain this option.
