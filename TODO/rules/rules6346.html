Carrion Sense (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have a natural ability to sniff out carrion. This functions like the scent ability, but only for corpses and badly wounded creatures (creatures with 25% or fewer hit points).

Darkvision 60 Feet (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Darkvision 120 Feet (3 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race can see in the dark up to 120 feet.

Deepsight (2 RP): Prerequisite: Amphibious racial trait; Benefit: Members of this race are specially adapted to the lightless depths of the oceans, but not to air-filled environments. They can see in the dark up to 120 feet while underwater, but do not gain this benefit out of water.

Low-Light Vision (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race can see twice as far as a race with normal vision in conditions of dim light.

Minesight (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have darkvision 90 feet; however, they are automatically dazzled in bright light and take a -2 penalty on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor.

Water Sense (1 RP): Prerequisite: Outsider (native) with ties to the Plane of Water or amphibious racial trait; Benefit: Members of this race can sense vibrations in water, granting them blindsense 30 feet against creatures that are touching the same body of water.
