In many cases, it's entirely reasonable to say, "Hey folks, this is the adventure I-ve prepared-work with me." Many groups of players respond positively if asked for help- after all, they want the game to go smoothly, too. Perhaps they just need a stronger hook for their characters, the promise of a bigger reward, or a change of pace from something too similar to what they did last time.

Canny GMs, though, won't force it more than absolutely necessary. It's often worth it to ask your players after the game (or one-on-one later, if that's easier) to tell you why they didn't buy into your original adventure premise, and what sort of adventure they-d prefer. If they want more gold and glory, or to find out what's beyond the western mountains, find a way to make that an option. Player feedback allows you to craft a game that's more satisfying for everyone.
