Using the overclocked spells variant, confident spellcasters can attempt to weave more power into their spells as they cast them. This is not without risk: deviating from the stable, standard formulation of the spell risks collapse of the spell and the magical energy therein.

As a swift action while casting a spell, a spellcaster can attempt to increase either the spell's DC or her caster level for the spell. She must attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell's level + the minimum caster level of that spell for her class. If she succeeds, she can increase either her caster level or the DC of the spell by 2. If she fails, the spell is not cast and she loses the prepared spell or spell slot. If she fails the Spellcraft check by 5 or more, she also suffers a mishap, similar to a <a href="rulesc4ce.html?Name=Scrolls&amp;Category=Magic%20Items">scroll mishap</a>.

With Limited Magic: If you are using the <a href="rules2486.html?Name=Limited%20Magic&amp;Category=Spell%20Alterations">limited magic rules</a>, instead of increasing the caster level or DC by 2 on a successfully overclocked spell, instead allow the caster to gain the standard benefits of her full caster level and ability scores.

With Spell Fumbles: Apply the results of a <a href="rulese3ae.html?Name=Spell%20Fumbles&amp;Category=Active%20Spellcasting">spell fumble</a> in place of a mishap.
