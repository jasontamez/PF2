Healthy-Latent/Carrier-Weakened-Impaired-Disabled-Bedridden-Comatose-Dead



Latent/Carrier: A character in this stage has the disease, and may pass it on if contagious, but suffers no ill effects.

Weakened: A character weakened by a physical disease suffers all the effects of the sickened and fatigued conditions.

Impaired: A character impaired by a physical disease also suffers the effects of the exhausted condition. Whenever he takes a standard action, he must succeed at a Fortitude save at the same DC as the disease's DC or lose the action and gain the nauseated condition for 1 minute.

Disabled: A character disabled by a physical disease gains the disabled condition. If he takes a standard action, his hit points drop by 1 or to -1, whichever is worse.

Bedridden: A character rendered bedridden by a physical disease is awake and can converse, but he can't stand on his own or take any standard or move actions.

Comatose: A character rendered comatose by physical disease is unconscious and feverish. He can't be woken by any means as long as he remains in this state on the disease track.

Dead: The disease overcomes the body's immune system, and the character dies. The corpse may be still be contagious, and some diseases may have unusual effects after the character dies.
