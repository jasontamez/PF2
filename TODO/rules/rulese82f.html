You can use Perception to detect that a secret message is being transmitted by someone using the Influence skill. Your Perception check is opposed by the sender's Influence check. You take a -2 penalty for each piece of information you lack relating to the message. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know there's a hidden message but don't know its content. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you might infer false information. See the pass secret message function of Influence on page 60 for rules on sending a secret message.

Action: None. This function is included in the time spent receiving the message.

Try Again: No, though you can attempt a check against another hidden message.
