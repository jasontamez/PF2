Your monster's array-and potentially its grafts, spell list boons, and options-will tell you how many good and master skills to assign that monster. You should assign whatever feels right during this step. You might decide that an especially scholarly spellcaster monster should have more master skills than normal, or that you want to follow the construct array's guidelines and forgo giving your construct any good or master skills at all. In any case, the total number of skills you choose should be within one or two of the suggested numbers.

Mark down all the skills the monster has and indicate their bonuses. Use the bonus as written-don't add the monster's ability modifier on top of it. For instance, a CR 9 combatant has a +7 for its highest ability modifier and a +17 for its master skill bonus. If you assigned the monster's highest ability modifier to Strength and picked Climb as a master skill, the monster would still get only a +17 bonus on Climb checks, not a +24.
