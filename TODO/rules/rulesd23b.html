A successful Athletics check while you're in the water allows you to swim at either half your speed as a full-round action or one-quarter your speed as a move action. If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater. Attempt one Athletics check to swim each round.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Water</td><td>Athletics DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Calm water</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>Rough water</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Stormy water</td><td>20*</td></tr> </table> * You can't take 10 on an Athletics check to swim in stormy water.

Action: Move action at one-quarter your speed or full-round action at half your speed.

Holding Your Breath: When you're underwater, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your Constitution score. If you take a standard or full-round action, reduce the duration you can continue to hold your breath by 1 round. After you run out of rounds, you must succeed at a DC 10 Constitution check each round or begin to drown. Each round, the DC to resist drowning increases by 1. See the <a href="rulescfe3.html?Name=Drowning&amp;Category=Water%20Dangers">Drowning</a> rules from the Core Rulebook.

Extended Swimming: Each hour you swim, you must succeed at a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage.

Swim Speeds: A creature with a swim speed gains a +8 racial bonus on Athletics checks to swim. See the <a href="skills9df6.html?ItemName=Swim">Swim</a> skill from the Core Rulebook for more information on swim speeds.
