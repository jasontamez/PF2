As you make your way through this book, you will see a number of abilities, feats, spells, magic items, and monsters refer to "mythic" versus "non-mythic" creatures and sources. For the purposes of the rules that follow, a creature is mythic if it has a mythic tier or mythic rank. Any mythic creature is considered a mythic source. The term "mythic source" can also apply to an attack, feat, spell, magic item, or other effect that originates from a mythic source.

Creatures are non-mythic if they don't have any mythic ranks or tiers. Any non-mythic creature is a non-mythic source, as is any attack or effect originating from a non-mythic source.
