Secrets are powerful in any Pathfinder game, even ones entirely focused on combat, since discovering secrets enables characters to learn an enemy's strengths and weaknesses and plan accordingly. However, when you're using intrigue in your game, secrets are even more significant. In fact, a truly powerful secret can be a far greater reward than even a dragon's hoard. Secrets are tied into all the other elements of an intrigue-based game. They can destroy relationships and change loyalties, often to the advantage of the one who holds or releases the secret. Disclosing a secret can shatter someone's false appearance. For instance, no matter how high the PCs roll on Diplomacy, their words alone can't persuade the kind and faithful queen to help assassinate or oust her husband, an evil king who has convinced everyone-even his wife, whom he truly loves-that he is a good man. But if the PCs expose the king's dark secrets in a convincing way, then pull off a skilled effort to influence the queen, they just might succeed. Secrets are also part and parcel of blackmail plots, which can lead to fascinating bargains and backroom deals. Of course, though using extortion might earn you an ally of sorts, such alliances are built on ill will. Because of the dangers of leaked secrets, protecting secrets is a main impetus of the arms race of measures and countermeasures mentioned earlier. And, of course, sometimes the most dangerous thing a character can do is discover a secret that someone powerful doesn't want anyone to know.
