This is the finest of techniques when it works, though it can be overplayed. The illusion of free choice is really a matter of the GM convincing the PCs to do exactly what he wants while making them think it's their idea. The simplest method in theory is often the hardest in practice: giving the players several choices, all of which lead to the same adventure. This might be as easy as simply changing a hook-the PCs didn't know that the old man they ignored in the bar was about to tell them the same thing as the ancient treasure map they discover in the town graveyard. The ancient dungeon can be uncovered by order of the king, as the party is marching off into the wilds, or as the only hope for a town surrounded by enemies-once they go there, the adventure is the same, regardless of how they got there.

Sometimes, of course, the party has a reasonable idea what the adventure is and still decides to avoid it. In these cases, it's sometimes best to subtly make the adventure more and more compelling until of course the players decide to go after the big treasure hoard guarded by their arch-nemesis-they've finally learned his weakness, and they only have a few days to exploit it!

That's a bit of a hard sell, but notice three things about the example. First, it involves a pre-established nemesis; by tying the adventure into the PCs' goals as characters, you've made the same basic adventure seem far more appealing. Second, it provides a lure in the form of cash- because in this case, you've watched your players enough to know that this particular party loves loot more than glory or doing the right thing. Third, the hook relies on a change in circumstances that is time-dependent. If the party doesn't act now, ready or not, this opportunity will not come again. Limited-time offers have a way of selling things, whether it's adventures or refrigerators.

Above all, put yourself in the player's shoes. Don't think about how cool the villain is, how clever the traps are, or how smart the backstory is-think about what's in it for your players, and why an adventure would appeal to them personally, and you'll never go wrong.
