Mythic Adventures uses several terms that are new to the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, or that previously existed but were rarely used. These terms are worth reviewing before continuing on with the rest of this book.

Ascension: The <a href="rulese388.html?Name=Mythic%20Ascension&amp;Category=Creating%20a%20Mythic%20Character">moment of ascension</a> is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path.

Boon: When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a <a href="rulesb4b3.html?Name=Mythic%20Boons&amp;Category=Running%20a%20Mythic%20Game">boon</a>. A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.

DR/Epic: A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 299). Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.

Mythic: With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank. (See <a href="rulesf589.html?Name=Mythic%20versus%20Non-Mythic&amp;Category=What%20is%20Mythic?">Mythic versus Non-Mythic</a>.)

Mythic Path: (Often referred to just as a "path.") The theme of a character's mythic abilities is determined by her <a href="mythic.html">mythic path</a>-archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier.

Mythic Power: Each mythic character can call upon this <a href="rules4089.html?Name=Base%20Mythic%20Abilities&amp;Category=Mythic%20Heroes">base mythic ability</a> to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities.

Mythic Rank: (Often referred to just as a "rank.") Similar to tiers, <a href="rulesa59b.html?Name=Mythic%20Rank&amp;Category=Mythic%20Monsters">mythic ranks</a> are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10.

Mythic Tier: (Often referred to just as a "tier.") Mythic characters advance in power by <a href="rules11f9.html?Name=Gaining%20Tiers&amp;Category=Mythic%20Heroes">gaining tiers</a>, each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities.

Mythic Trial: (Often referred to just as a "trial.") A <a href="rulesc3b7.html?Name=Mythic%20Trials&amp;Category=Running%20a%20Mythic%20Game">trial</a> is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.

Non-Mythic: Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank.(See <a href="rulesf589.html?Name=Mythic%20versus%20Non-Mythic&amp;Category=What%20is%20Mythic?">Mythic versus Non-Mythic</a>.)

Surge: Surge is a basic ability that each mythic character receives. It allows her to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, influencing the outcome after the results are revealed.
