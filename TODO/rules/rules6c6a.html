Areas of wilderness devastated by magical battles sometimes regrow vegetation bearing supernatural scars of those conflicts. When the flora in such an area develops a taste for magical energy, the plants and trees display vivid and unusual colors for their type and can even subtly change color. Spellgorging plants thrive on magical energy, making the casting of spells difficult when such plants are nearby. When a creature adjacent to a spellgorging plant attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability, the creature must make a successful concentration check (DC = 20 + the level of the spell) or the spell is lost as the flora absorbs the energy as it is cast. Most magic items are not affected by spellgorging plants, with the exception of spell-completion and spell-trigger items. When such an item is used, the user must attempt a caster level check against the same DC as above but using the item's caster level instead of his own, in order to successfully use the item.

An area of spellgorging plants can be identified with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nature), or Survival check due to the unusual colors and shapes of the surrounding flora. Most animals avoid eating spellgorging plants because of their bizarre and unpleasant taste. A creature consuming a spellgorging plant must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 hours. A spellgorging plant loses its ability to consume magic if it is destroyed'spellgorging plants have SR 20 for the purposes of resisting magical spell effects, but they otherwise have normal hit points and hardness for plants of their type.
