Fivefold Rings of Fire

Slot ring; CL 10th; Weight -
Aura moderate evocation; Price 10,800 gp; Scaling prize

Description

These five golden rings are each set with a fire opal and are linked together by thin golden chains (making them take up only a single ring item slot). The wearer can release up to five <a href="spelldisplay87db.html?ItemName=scorching%20rays">scorching rays</a> each day, one from each of the five rings. She can release one ray as a standard action or two rays (from two different rings) as a full-round action.
12th Level: Each day, the wearer can ignore up to 40 points of fire damage as if using <a href="spelldisplaya627.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20energy">protection from energy</a>. This fire damage is absorbed into the fivefold rings of fire; when this happens, if the wearer has already expended one or more of her <a href="spelldisplay87db.html?ItemName=scorching%20rays">scorching rays</a> for the day, she can recharge one of the rings for every 20 points of fire damage she absorbs.
14th Level: In place of a <a href="spelldisplayd694.html?ItemName=scorching%20ray">scorching ray</a>, the wearer can choose to create a <a href="spelldisplay85dc.html?ItemName=flaming%20sphere">flaming sphere</a>. The effect takes the form of hollow rings of flame instead of a sphere, but otherwise functions as the spell.
16th Level: The amount of fire damage the wearer can absorb each day increases to 100 points.
