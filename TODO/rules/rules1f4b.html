While it's possible to insist that players not eat or drink at the game table, it's hard to enforce such a rule. Roleplaying sessions take a long time, and people get hungry and thirsty. You can set up snacks on a separate table or in a different room, but they're likely to find their way to the game table anyway.

If you decide to allow food at the table, you'll have to prepare for the inevitable messes. Keep towels at the table to quickly clean up spilled beverages, and encourage the use of plastic page protectors for character sheets. It's a good idea to keep reference books off the table for the same reason.

Also note that food and beverages aren't free. If you rotate locations, you can agree that snacks are the responsibility of the house where the game occurs, ask that everyone bring a snack or beverage to share, or simply pass the hat at each session for contributions to the snack fund.
