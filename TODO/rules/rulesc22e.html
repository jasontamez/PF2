The following section includes weapons with unusual powers and magical abilities. Magic weapons can have abilities that need to be activated to function or powers that work passively and constantly.

Legacy Arrow

Slot none; CL 4th; Weight 1/10 lb.
Aura faint transmutation; Price 305 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

This ornately carved arrow always survives being fired. By concentrating as a standard action, the last person to shoot the arrow can sense the direction in which it lies, up to a distance of 1 mile. This effect fades 24 hours after firing. Initially, a legacy arrow acts merely as a masterwork arrow, but it always retains its ability to survive and be recovered after use. Legacy arrows can be found as other sorts of ammunition, including bolts, shuriken, sling bullets, and even firearm bullets.
6th Level: The arrow has the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay2c40.html?ItemName=Distance">distance</a> special ability, normally not available to ammunition. When fired, it loses this weapon special ability and any gained at higher levels for 1 day.
9th Level: The arrow has the distance and <a href="magicweaponsdisplayef15.html?ItemName=Seeking">seeking</a> special abilities.
11th Level: When fired, the arrow regains its special abilities after 10 minutes instead of 1 day.
14th Level: Once per day as a standard action, the arrow's wielder can designate it as a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">bane</a> arrow for a category of her choice. It retains its current bane properties until they are changed. The arrow still takes 10 minutes to regain the use of bane, as usual.
16th Level: The arrow retains its bane, distance, and seeking special abilities after being fired.
18th Level: Once per week, the wielder can take a standard action to fire the arrow, giving it the properties of a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5759.html?ItemName=Slaying%20Arrow%20(greater)">greater slaying arrow</a> (keyed to the same category as its bane ability) in addition to its other special abilities. After being fired, the arrow loses all special abilities for 1 week.
20th Level: The greater slaying ability can be used once per day (after which the arrow loses all special abilities for 1 day) rather than once per week. The arrow overcomes damage reduction as though adamantine.
