The stat block for a challenge includes a short description and the following sections.

Tasks: These are the options a creator can choose from when trying to complete the challenge. They contain only short titles, and the GM should interpret the specifics in an interesting way that makes sense based on the story.

Results: These entries cover the consequences of success or failure. Use the results from only one category; a critical success doesn't also give the benefits of a normal success, and a critical failure doesn't also impose the effects of a normal failure.
