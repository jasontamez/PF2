Each leadership role provides bonuses to kingdom statistics based on one of the leader's ability scores. The GM may want to allow a leader's ranks in a relevant skill (such as Diplomacy or Intimidate) to also affect the kingdom statistics. For every 5 full ranks in a relevant skill, the leader may increase the leadership modifier by an additional 1. These skill-based additional bonuses modify the standard leadership role bonuses in the same way that the Leadership feat grants additional bonuses.

The relevant skills for each leadership role are as follows.

Ambassador: Diplomacy

Consort: Knowledge (nobility)

Councilor: Knowledge (local)

General: Profession (soldier)

Grand Diplomat: Diplomacy

Heir: Knowledge (nobility)

High Priest: Knowledge (religion)

Magister: Knowledge (arcana)

Marshal: Survival

Royal Enforcer: Intimidate

Ruler: Knowledge (nobility)

Spymaster: Sense Motive

Treasurer: Profession (merchant)

Viceroy: Knowledge (geography)

Warden: Knowledge (engineering)
