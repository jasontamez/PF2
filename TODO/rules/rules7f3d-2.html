You can make jumps using Athletics. The DC is equal to the distance crossed (in feet) for a long jump or four times the height to be reached (in feet) for a high jump. If you don't have a running start of at least 10 feet, double the DC. If you fail an Athletics check to jump across a horizontal gap by 4 or less, you can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save to grab hold of the other side. If you fail by 5 or more, you fall (or land prone if you were attempting a high jump). The DC for a jump uses the same modifiers as the DC of an Acrobatics check (see page 54), depending on the surface from which you're jumping. For example, the DC for a jump that begins on a sandy surface would increase by 2. You can't exceed your maximum movement for a round by jumping.

Action: None.

Acrobatics: You can attempt to use Acrobatics instead of Athletics to jump, at a -5 penalty.

Speed Bonus: If your base land speed is 40 feet or more, you gain a +4 racial bonus on Athletics checks to jump for every 10 feet by which your base land speed exceeds 30 feet. Likewise, you take a -4 racial penalty for every 10 feet your speed is below 30 feet.
