One of the first things PCs are likely to wonder before or after having their fates revealed is whether or not their fortune-teller's words are true. Some fortune-tellers are complete con artists, devoid of any kind of mystical power, using the same techniques as real-world mystics. If a fortune teller is scamming the PCs, you should roll a Bluff check to determine the effectiveness of her performance. Don't call for a Sense Motive check from the characters unless they raise the question of their seer's legitimacy. Part of the effectiveness of fortune-telling is the recipient's belief in the medium's miraculous insights. Only once a character doubts these powers does the illusion risk breaking down.

The Pathfinder RPG also presents many magical options for fortune-telling. The spells <a href="spelldisplaybb99.html?ItemName=augury">augury</a>, <a href="spelldisplay54f1.html?ItemName=contact%20other%20plane">contact other plane</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay0aab.html?ItemName=vision">vision</a>, along with a host of other divination spells, all prove useful in giving characters insights into the future, where classic magic items like <a href="magicwondrousdisplaycefc.html?FinalName=Crystal%20BallNormal">crystal balls</a> and <a href="magicwondrousdisplayad66.html?FinalName=Medallion%20of%20Thoughts">medallions of thoughts</a> allow seers to demonstrate their uncanny insights. A variety of illusion-based spells and magic items, such as a <a href="spelldisplay2667.html?ItemName=major%20image">wand of major image</a> or a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay17ad.html?FinalName=Deck%20of%20Illusions">deck of illusions</a>, help bring flair to a fortuneteller's readings, regardless of actual truthfulness. Pathfinder Campaign Setting World Guide: The Inner Sea also presents the <a href="prestigeclassesdisplayd6b0.html?ItemName=Harrower">harrower prestige class</a>, which employs the aforementioned Harrow Deck and allows characters to play a kind of adventuring fortune-teller.
