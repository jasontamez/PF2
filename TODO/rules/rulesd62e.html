Improvements are physical improvements you can make to your kingdom: founding new settlements, adding buildings to a settlement, building roads, creating facilities such as mines to tap natural resources, and claiming more hexes for your kingdom. Your kingdom's Size limits how many improvements you can make each turn; see Table 4-4: Improvement Edicts below. You can make all of the improvements listed on the appropriate row of the table. For example, if your kingdom's Size is 5, on each turn you can create 1 new settlement, 1 new building, 2 terrain improvements, and claim 1 more hex.



Table 4-4: Improvement Edicts

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Kingdom Size</td><td>New Settlements</td><td>New Buildings</td><td>Terrain Improvements</td><td>Hex Claims</td></tr><tr><td>01-10</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>11-25</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>26-50</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>51-100</td><td>2</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>101-200</td><td>3</td><td>20</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>201+</td><td>4</td><td>No limit</td><td>12</td><td>12</td></tr></table>1 Instead of creating a new settlement, your kingdom may create a new army unit (see Mass Combat, starting on page 234), expand or equip an existing army unit, or bring an existing army unit back to full strength.
2 Upgrading a building (for example, from a Shrine to a Temple) or destroying a building counts toward this limit. The first House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement your kingdom builds each turn does not count against this number.
