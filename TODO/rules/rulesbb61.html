Grass fires are often caused by lightning or careless camp fires. A grass fire is similar to a <a href="rules9ff7.html?Name=Forest%20Fires%20(CR%206)&amp;Category=Forest%20Terrain">forest fire</a>, except it can be spotted at twice the normal distance, and a PC caught in its area saves against heat damage only every 10 rounds.
