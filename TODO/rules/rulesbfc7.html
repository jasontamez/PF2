Curses can afflict characters in a variety of ways, but because they are perniciously difficult to remove, the tone of the game can shift if they appear often. Most curses-especially those that require more than a simple <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> spell to eliminate'should be used to add a significant and memorable challenge or as a consequence for a momentous choice.
