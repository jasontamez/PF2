Be it a misbehaving reflection, a whispering taxidermy, or a leering portrait, sometimes the most minor supernatural effect-noticeable as the subtlest feeling of wrongness' proves the most unsettling.

By the Rules: The rules for <a href="rules2924.html?Name=Haunts&amp;Category=Advanced%20Topics">haunts</a> allow GMs to generate practically infinite terrifying effects and create creepy but harmless encounters with which the players can interact.

Extrapolation: A purely thematic or otherwise harmless haunt probably shouldn't grant experience points and so shouldn't have a CR.

Horror Considerations: One doesn't have to bother with rules at all. GMs don't need to explain every thematic effect or unnerving embellishment, especially when these exist in the space between supernatural manifestations and the PCs' own uncertain observations. If a situation doesn't require hard-and-fast rules, a GM doesn't need to complicate things.
