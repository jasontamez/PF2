A thought-form creature is a mentally constructed thrall that takes any form its creator desires. Creating a thought-form creature takes 1 full round (as if the creator were casting a spell with a 1-round casting time) and lasts as long as its creator concentrates on the creature's existence as a full-round action; a combatant can manifest only one thought-form creature at a time. A thought-form creature must make its attacks against another thought-form creature if one is manifested; if not, it can attack its creator's opponent. The creature makes its attacks when its creator uses a full-round action to concentrate on the thought-form creature. When a thought-from creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it disappears and its creator takes an amount of damage equal to the thought-form creature's psychic backlash (see Thought-Form Creature Statistics below). A thought-form creature can be dismissed as a free action.

A basic thought-form creature costs 1 MP to create, and has the following base statistics.

Thought-Form Creature Statistics: AC creator's AC; touch AC creator's touch AC; hp 1/2 creator's current hit points; Attack Bonus creator's manifesting level + creator's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest); Damage 1d6 + creator's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest); Saves creator's save bonuses; Psychic Backlash 1d10 + the MP cost of the thought-form creature.

Thought-Form Creature Augmentations: When creating a thought-form creature, the creator can apply any of the following augmentations, up to her maximum MP limit.

Increase Attack Bonus: Increase the cost by up to 4 MP to increase the thought-form creature's attack bonus on all its attacks by the same amount.

Extra Attacks: Increase the cost by 2 MP to grant the thought-form creature a second attack each round. Increasing the cost by an additional 2 MP grants it a third attack, but the creature makes the third attack at a -5 penalty.

Increase Armor Class: Increase the cost by up to 4 MP to increase the thought-form creature's AC by the same amount and its touch AC by half that amount.

Increase Saving Throws: Increase the cost by 2 or 4 MP to increase the bonus on all of the thought-form creature's saving throws by half that amount.

Increase Hit Points: Increase the cost by up to 4 MP to increase the thought-form creature's hit points by 10 ?? that amount.

Increase Damage: Increase the cost by 1 MP to increase the thought-form creature's damage die type for all its attacks to d8, or by 2 MP to increase the damage die type to d10. If the thought-form creature has only one attack, its damage bonus with that attack increases to 1-1/2 ?? the creator's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest).

Protective Ability: Increase the cost by 1 MP to grant the creator a +4 bonus to AC (both normal and touch), a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws, and evasion for as long as this thought-form creature exists. Increasing the cost by an additional 2 MP also grants the creator immunity to attacks against AC or touch AC for as long as this thought-form creature exists.
