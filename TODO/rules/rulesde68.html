Plot items work like setting items, except that, instead of referring to great events of the past, they set up future developments in the PCs' personal stories. Introduce them to the players before the action begins, perhaps with a brief description on an index card. Be careful not to impose choices that alter a player's character background. Work with the player until you have a hook that works for you, and a personal detail that fits her vision. Although secrets occasionally lead to interesting play, backstories the players are willing to share with the rest of the group are more likely to take an active role in play.

At a suitable moment in the action, invite the player to describe the item and its backstory to the other players. Examples include: <ul><li>"I found this magical feather in a red vellum envelope, slipped under my door at the inn the day before I set out for the big city. A note inside was signed only, -Your benefactor."- (The gift establishes a mystery, the identity of the benefactor, which you can slowly develop and finally reveal.) </li><li>"This darkwood shield was given to me by my uncle, who said it saved his hide several times, back during the gnoll raids." (This detail introduces a mentor figure who can give the PCs crotchety advice, and sets up the possibility that the gnolls will rise again to terrorize the area.)</li></ul>
