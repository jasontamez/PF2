A vexing adversary, this <a href="monsterdisplay4a88.html?ItemName=Imp">imp</a> has a variety of extra options to confound its enemies.
Array: The imp uses the expert array, with the Reflex and Will saves swapped. The imp has a Strength modifier of -4 because its size and build make it so physically weak.
Creature Type: The outsider graft gives the imp darkvision 60 feet, increases its Will saving throw from +1 to +3, and increases its attack bonus from +4 to +6. It gains the additional master skill mentioned under elective adjustments.
Subtype: The devil subtype gives the imp the see in darkness sense, energy resistance 10 to acid and cold, immunity to fire and poison, the summon allies option, and telepathy to a range of 100 feet.
Size: Because the imp is Tiny, its touch and flat-footed AC increased from 10 to 12.
Spells: The secondary magic option gives the imp some spell-like abilities.
Options: Instead of the single monster option that would be normal for an expert of its CR, the imp has a total of five options: change shape, dodge expert, poison, and modified versions of constant invisibility and secondary magic. Dodge expert changes the imp's AC from 14 (touch 12, flat-footed 12) to 16 (touch 16, flat-footed 10). By the numbers, the imp's flat-footed AC would drop to 6, but the GM sets it as 10 as part of the reality checking process. For its poison, the imp gets two advantages, which were used to remove the onset time and change the frequency to 1/round for 6 rounds. Instead of the normal effect of constant invisibility, the imp gains <a href="spelldisplay749c.html?ItemName=invisibility">invisibility</a> at will, affecting only itself. The modified secondary magic option gives the imp one once-per-day spell and two constant spells instead of two once-per-day spells.
Skills: The imp has an extra master skill from the outsider graft, and gains Fly and Stealth from its size graft. The +10 bonus from change shape is included in the Disguise skill.
Damage: The imp uses the low damage value on its sting to compensate for being a low-CR creature with poison.
