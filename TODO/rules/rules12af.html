The magical objects detailed by the game rules are, for obvious reasons, restricted to items useful to adventurers. It stands to reason, though, that in a world of readily available enchantment, many items would be broadly useful in everyday life and of little or no interest to explorers and freebooters. These items are memorable and unique but players will inevitably trade them for cash or use them to solve plot dilemmas. You don't need detailed rules for them because they don't affect the world of adventure in which the characters operate. Categories of non-adventuring enchantments include: <ul><li>Agricultural: enhanced plows, fertility potions for livestock, or magic beans </li><li>Decorative: art objects, architectural features, furniture, or garments made more beautiful and wondrous by magical means </li><li>Tools: enhanced hammers, leather-curing vats, never-dull scissors, rope-making devices, or self-heating forges</li></ul>
