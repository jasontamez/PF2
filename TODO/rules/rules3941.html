These optional grafts replicate popular monster templates, and are applied on top of the creature type or class graft chosen for the monster. Template graft entries follow a format similar to creature type grafts.

Minimum or Maximum CR: This entry indicates what the lowest or highest possible CR for the monster can be. A header that says "CR 2+- indicates the monster's CR must be 2 or higher, and -CR 9?"?? means its CR can't be higher than 9.

Required Creature Type or Subtype: For templates that change a creature's type or subtype in the normal monster creation system, this entry shows which creature type or subtype the monster must be in order to apply the template graft.

Suggested Array: This indicates the monster array the template is most closely associated with, if any. Liches, for example, are almost always spellcasters.

Automatic Traits: All creatures with this graft gain these abilities. The automatic traits might tell you to add particular monster options or skills. These count against the monster's normal number of options, skills, and so forth, replacing them (unlike subtype grafts, which grant options and skills for free). However, even if the automatic traits would cause a monster to exceed its maximum number of options or skills, the monster still gains all of them. If the monster has a class graft, use your best judgment when replacing options to maintain the feeling of both the class and template.

Suggested Ability Modifiers: This section lists the recommended assignments for the monster's high ability scores, in order from highest to lowest. For instance, the graveknight lists "Strength, Charisma, Wisdom," meaning that when making a CR 10 graveknight, you would give it a +7 Strength modifier, a +5 Charisma modifier, and a +3 Wisdom modifier. Not all entries list modifiers for all abilities. A ghost, for example, lists only Charisma since the remaining statistics can vary, and a half-dragon doesn't have an entry at all as half-dragons are so varied.
