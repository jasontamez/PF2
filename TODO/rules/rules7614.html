These options improve a monster's ability to bring minion creatures into the fight.

Children of the Night: Once per day as a standard action, the monster can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves. (If the monster is not terrestrial, it might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the monster for 1 hour.

Phantom Mount: Once per hour, the monster can summon a horse similar to a <a href="spelldisplay1cee.html?ItemName=phantom%20steed">phantom steed</a>. This mount is more substantial than a typical <a href="spelldisplay1cee.html?ItemName=phantom%20steed">phantom steed</a>, and can carry one additional rider. The mount's powers are based on the monster's total CR rather than caster level.

Powerful Summons: Increase the duration of the monster's conjuration (summoning) spells by a number of rounds equal to the monster's CR. Any creature summoned by such a spell also gains temporary hit points equal to 1/2 the monster's CR and a +2 bonus on damage rolls.

Undead Mastery: As a standard action, the monster can choose one undead creature within 50 feet. That creature must succeed at a Will save or fall under the monster's control. This control is permanent for unintelligent undead; an undead creature with an Intelligence score can attempt an additional saving throw each day to break free. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw cannot be affected again by the same monster's undead mastery for 24 hours.

A monster can control a number of undead creatures with a combined CR equal to its own CR. If this limit is exceeded, the excess undead become uncontrolled in order from longest-controlled to most recently controlled.
