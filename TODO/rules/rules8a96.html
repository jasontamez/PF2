The <a href="monsterdisplay7cda.html?ItemName=Goblin">goblin fighter</a> is a suitable minion for any overlord, provided it doesn't burn the fortress down.
Array: The goblin fighter is a combatant, as required by the fighter class graft.
Creature Type: Because of the fighter class graft, the goblin does not gain anything from the humanoid type.
Class: As a fighter, the goblin increases both its Fortitude and Reflex bonuses from +1 to +2. It also receives one combat option from its fighter graft.
Subtype: The goblin fighter gains Stealth as a good skill from the goblinoid subtype.
Size: The goblin's Small size increases its touch AC and flat-footed AC by 1, reduces its CMB by 2, and reduces its CMD by 1. It gains Stealth as a good skill (again; see below).
Options: A fighter of this CR typically gets one combat option, but this goblin has two additional options to reflect its quick combat style. The accuracy, dodge expert, and improved initiative options are all calculated in the goblin fighter's statistics. The adjustment to flat-footed AC from dodge expert would have made the goblin's flat-footed AC too low for a monster at this CR, so the goblin gains only a +1 bonus to touch AC and no penalty to its flat-footed AC. Goblins are able to see in the dark, so the goblin gains the darkvision option. As usual, adding a sense didn't count against the goblin's number of options.
Skills: The goblin already gets Stealth as a good skill from both the goblinoid and Small grafts, so instead it was discretionarily given Stealth as a second master skill.
