For feats and abilities that grant bonuses or penalties to skills, it's best for the GM to either ban them or adjust them to work only with specific functions of the feat. That is to say, the consolidated skills still cover the functions of the skills they've absorbed, so a bonus can still apply to only a specific function. For example, the <a href="featdisplay5136.html?ItemName=Intimidating%20Prowess">Intimidating Prowess</a> feat should add a character's Strength modifier instead of Charisma only when using the Influence skill to intimidate, rather than adding it to the Influence skill in all cases. The <a href="spelldisplaydb03.html?ItemName=jump">jump</a> spell should give a bonus only on Athletics checks to jump, rather than on all Athletics checks. There are no direct conversions for this effect, so it must be done on a case-by-case basis.
