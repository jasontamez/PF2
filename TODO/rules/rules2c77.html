An organization's stat block is arranged as follows.

Name: The organization's name.

Alignment and Prominence: An organization's alignment is the alignment that most closely represents its policies and actions. While individual members of an organization may be of any alignment, an organization's key NPCs are typically within one step of the organization's overall alignment. An organization's prominence may be weak, moderate, strong, or preeminent. More details on prominence appear under <a href="rules0cb7.html?Name=Prominence&amp;Category=Organizational%20Influence">Prominence</a>.

Size: An organization's size is an approximation of its number of active members.

Key Members: Key members of an organization are both visible leaders and shadowy schemers who have significant pull.

Values: An organization may value any number of traits in its members, such as creativity, generosity, dependability, skill at particular tasks, or social station.

Public Goals: All but the most clandestine organizations share some of their goals with the general public.

Private Goals: These are the private goals both of the organization as a whole and of key members. Sometimes, the private goal of a key member might conflict with the private goal of the organization.

Allies and Enemies: Organizations do not exist in a vacuum. An organization's prominent allies and enemies are noted here. PCs can gain or lose influence with an organization based on their interactions with its allied or opposed organizations.

Membership Requirements: Most organizations have a procedure for officially joining them, and expect their members to satisfy ongoing commitments (like paying dues).

Influence Limitations: Often, the PCs need to perform a specific task for an organization before they can raise their influence past a certain threshold. The most common requirement is for the PCs to join an organization, but organizations may require more complicated tasks or favors before counting the PCs among their most trusted allies.

Benefits: This section lists favors that the PCs can call in based on their influence rank with the organization. The PCs can always choose benefits on the available list for their current rank or a lower rank within the organization, and, at the GM's discretion, the PCs might be able to access the benefits for lower ranks for a decreased number of favors, or even for free, if the PCs request the benefit a reasonable number of times. To approximate the benefits that the PCs can gain from an organization outside of its base of operations, the GM should decrease the PCs' effective influence rank appropriately, to a minimum of Rank 0 if the PCs are entirely beyond the organization's reach.

New Benefits: This section details the benefits the PCs can earn from the organization beyond those listed in the Common Benefits section.
