Depending on your campaign, a mythic monster might be unique-the only one of a kind in the entire world or on all the planes-rare, or even relatively common. The following are some examples of how frequently mythic monsters could appear in a particular campaign. <ul><li>Some say there is only one mythic red dragon-the oldest living ancestor of all red dragons-and it sleeps for centuries at a time. </li><li>A deadly pack of mythic trolls might rule over a hidden realm under the earth. Non-mythic trolls are the least of their kind, cast out because of their inborn weakness. </li><li>There may be only two mythic medusas, both mourning their third sister who was slain by a hero centuries ago. They now breed giant snakes (with a mythic simple template) to send after the hero's descendants. </li><li>A demon lord might imbue some of its servants with mythic power, making them captains and generals over the armies it's amassing to invade the mortal world.</li></ul> How prevalent you want mythic creatures to be in your campaign is up to you, and their mythic abilities can be permanent or temporary.
