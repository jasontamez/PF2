Healthy-Weakened-Impaired-Confused-Comatose-Dead



Weakened: A character whose awareness is weakened by Wisdom poison takes a -2 penalty on all Wisdom-based skill checks and ability checks, as well as on Will saves. A character with spellcasting based on Wisdom decreases her DCs by 2 and can no longer cast her highest level of spells. Impaired: A character impaired by Wisdom poison does not add her Wisdom bonus to the number of uses per day of pools and abilities (such as a ki pool) and does not gain bonus spells per day from her Wisdom. She takes an additional -2 penalty on the above Wisdom-based rolls. A Wisdom-based caster reduces her DCs by an additional 2, and can no longer cast her 2 highest levels of spells.

Confused: A character who's confused by Wisdom poison has difficulty processing reality and is dangerous to herself and others. Each round, she rolls on the chart from the <a href="spelldisplayee40.html?ItemName=confusion">confusion</a> spell to determine her actions.

Comatose: A character rendered comatose by Wisdom poison is no longer able to experience reality or receive sensory information. She can't be woken by any means as long as she remains in this state.

Dead: Forever lost in her own inner reality, the character's brain stops working, and she dies.
