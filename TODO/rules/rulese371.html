Just as effective (and less dramatic) is removing distractions directly. You're the GM-it's okay to tell players at the start of the game to put away the game system or music, cell phone or laptop. And it's also okay to tell them right at the start of the session that if they're not paying attention when it's their character's turn, you'll skip them that round. That usually does the trick, but if the carrot works better than the stick, you could also give additional XP to the players who are most engaged and prepared when it's their turn. You can also help them out by writing the initiative order down on the battlemat so the players know who's acting next, or using a GameMastery Combat Pad or initiative tracker that everyone can see.
