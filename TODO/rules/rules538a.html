Arcane Flux: An experimental ritual performed by the Cabal has granted you additional power. Roll 1d4; you gain a bonus arcane spell slot of that spell level (as if from a high ability score, up to a maximum of the highest-level arcane spell slot you can cast) for 24 hours.

Discovery: A member of your Cabal has produced some unexpected results. Roll d%. On a result of 01-75, the Cabal creates 1d6 random 1st-level arcane scrolls (add +1 scroll if you have the <a href="featdisplay6b63.html?ItemName=Scribe%20Scroll">Scribe Scroll</a> feat). On a result of 76-100, the Cabal creates 1d3 random 1st-level arcane potions (add +1 potion if you have the <a href="featdisplay2e88.html?ItemName=Brew%20Potion">Brew Potion</a> feat). You may keep these potions or sell them for full value.

Familiar Scraps: Several familiars belonging to members of your Cabal are causing problems with each other or with local animals. You must succeed at a DC 25 Diplomacy, Handle Animal, or Knowledge (arcana) check, or spend 1d4 points of Goods and Influence (divided as you see fit) to calm things down.

Image Problem: An influential person, such as a conservative noble, leader of a rival organization, or professor at a local academy tries to discredit your organization. Attempt a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Knowledge (arcana) check opposed by this person's Bluff, Intimidate, or Knowledge (arcana) check (1d20 + 5 if the GM doesn't have a specific person in mind). If you succeed, you weather the bad comments and the event ends with no negative repercussions. If you succeed by at least 5, you increase your acclaim, gaining 1 point of Influence or Labor. If you fail, you lose 1d3 points of Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic (divided as you see fit) because of vandalism or members leaving out of fear.

Portent: A cabalist discovers an upcoming alignment of magical forces, increasing the cabal's productivity. For 1d3 days, the organization gains a +10 bonus on its first check each day to generate Goods, Influence, or Magic.

Work Opportunity: A noble, merchant, or other patron hires your Cabal to assist with magical preparations for a ritual or festival. For 1d6 days, the organization gains a +5 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day. If you rolled a 6 for the number of days, there's a 20% chance this causes a discovery event as described above.
