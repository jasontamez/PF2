Damage taken during a pursuit follows all the normal rules for damage. A healer can use the <a href="rules111b.html?Name=Individual%20Tactics&amp;Category=Pursuit%20Tactics">recovery tactic</a> to take a break and cast healing spells (or spells that remove afflictions or conditions, for that matter).

The <a href="rules2755.html?Name=Group%20Tactics&amp;Category=Pursuit%20Tactics">forced march and hustle tactics</a> cause nonlethal damage, and can cause characters to become fatigued (or exhausted if they were already fatigued). This nonlethal damage goes away at a rate of 1 per hour, as normal, and a character can use the recovery tactic to remove more. However, a character who is fatigued or exhausted takes any penalties that apply before the nonlethal damage is healed and the conditions removed.

The following penalties apply to characters who become fatigued or exhausted.

Fatigued: A fatigued character reduces her personal progress by 1. This reduction applies before any multiplication or division due to the character tracking, hustling, or performing similar activities.

Exhausted: An exhausted character halves her personal progress. This stacks with tactics that halve her progress, leaving her at 1/4 of her normal personal progress, or tactics that double her progress, leaving her at her normal personal progress. A character that becomes fatigued by a tactic while already exhausted falls unconscious.

Unconscious: An unconscious character has a personal progress of 0, and can't increase it as long as she remains unconscious. As with fatigue and exhaustion, the character must take this penalty for the entire phase in which she recovers from unconsciousness.
