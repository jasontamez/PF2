As characters enter the larger cosmic struggles of morality and alignment, they are able to gain new tools to help them champion their philosophies.

<a href="feats4ad7.html?Category=Alignment">Alignment Feats</a>: If you have at least 10 Hit Dice, you can take any alignment feat that matches your alignment. You cannot have more than one alignment feat at any time, but after changing alignment, when you reach a new character level, you can freely switch your alignment feat to your new alignment's feat. Most alignment feats have a Residual entry that allows you to benefit from some part of the feat even when you no longer meet the alignment prerequisite for the feat, usually aiding you in a small way to regain that alignment. Most alignment feats also allow you to store <a href="rules6336.html?Name=Shifts%20and%20Affirmations&amp;Category=Alignment%20(Unchained)">affirmations</a> for later use. If you shift alignment and no longer have the ability to store affirmations, any affirmations stored by that feat are lost.
