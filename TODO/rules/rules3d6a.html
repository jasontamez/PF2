When designing any type of social conflict event, it's always best to allow the PCs to advance the plot even in the face of a critical failure. Of course, there should be consequences for failure, but that should never be the end the story. In other words, a success moves the PCs toward victory and a failure moves their adversaries toward victory, but you shouldn't plan a result that creates a deadlock and stalls the flow of the action. So long as a defeat doesn't lead to the entire party's death, it likely brings with it a variety of exciting ramifications'sometimes more so than a success might. Feel free to use the PCs' defeats as springboards into new plots and more rewarding future victories.
