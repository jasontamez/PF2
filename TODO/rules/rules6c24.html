Once a GM has decided to create a frightening adventure, what sort of terror should be included? As explained in the discussion of horror subgenres, there are many types of horror. A GM should be able to boil her horror story down to something basic, perhaps even a singular fear. This might be as primal as a fear of spiders or of losing one's teeth, or it could be more sophisticated, like the fear of abandonment or mechanical disasters. Once the GM has chosen a fear, then she can choose an avatar or incarnation of that fear. This might be a monster, person, or other threat that embodies that fear and proliferates it. For example, nothing exploits a fear of spiders quite like giant spiders or spider swarms, while representing the fear of abandonment might require a creature like an <a href="monsterdisplay81ca.html?ItemName=Attic%20Whisperer">attic whisperer</a> or the spirit of a bitter old man who waits for death but can't be convinced that he's dead. This avatar can be anything a GM wants. Feel free to make it more terrifying or unnatural if that helps-the giant spiders could actually be scheming <a href="monsterdisplay180f.html?ItemName=Leng%20Spider">Leng spiders</a>, or the attic whisperer might control an army of animated dolls. This can work as mere flavor, or a GM might search out rules (or designs of her own) to back it up. Remember that the chosen threat might not need to be a literal embodiment; for instance, a fear of alien abductions and experimentation is literally embodied by <a href="monsterdisplaye8ee.html?ItemName=Gray">grays</a> but also metaphorically embodied by <a href="monsterdisplayf42f.html?ItemName=Derro">derros</a>.
