Description

While there is nothing physically wrong with the afflicted character, some kind of mental trauma has forced her brain to shut down sensory or motor systems. Furthermore, magical effects that typically remove these conditions (such as <a href="spelldisplayd77a.html?ItemName=remove%20blindness/%20deafness">remove blindness/ deafness</a>) have no effect on this madness; the madness must be cured in order to regain the senses or motor skills.
