Of the afflictions wreaked upon Sarkoris by the Worldwound
and Deskari's host, the demonplague is perhaps the
most insidious. This vile sickness spreads through water,
affecting plant and animal life alike. In higher creatures, the
demonplague causes madness and then death, but in animals
and other unintelligent beasts, it continues beyond death,
animating them as undead horrors called plagued beasts
(see page 56). The plague also twists and corrupts plant life-
most of the hazardous plants detailed below are the results
of normal plants becoming corrupted by the demonplague.

An explorer in the Worldwound can be exposed to the
demonplague in a number of ways. Plagued beasts carry
the sickness, and contact with a living sufferer can result in
infection. In addition, each day a person attempts a Survival
check to live off the land in the Worldwound, there's a chance
he is exposed to the plague, as described on page 28 and
varying in likelihood by region. A creature suffering from
demonplague begins to grow paranoid, and is prone to
increasingly realistic hallucinations. Its body slowly decays
away, starting with the loss of fingernails, teeth, and hair,
but advancing to complete limb loss or gaping wounds in the
hours before death.

Beyond the Worldwound's borders, the plague is much
less virulent. Creatures gain a +4 bonus on saving throws
against demonplague outside of the Worldwound, and those
suffering from it aren't contagious (although creatures like
plagued beasts can still infect victims with it).
