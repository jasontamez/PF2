Known to take root in places long buried by supernatural cold, this affliction infects ruins and deep forests throughout Irrisen. It slowly freezes creatures from the inside out without dealing cold damage, so sufferers simply feel the weariness and fatigue of exerting themselves in a cold environment. The aff liction reduces an affected creature's range of movement and acts in many ways like very gradual petrification. A sufferer is unable to speak, is severely slowed, and takes Dexterity damage; if the victim's Dexterity score drops below 5, it is unable to move at all. Creatures suffering from this plague don't die from it, but it often strands them out in the cold where they die from exposure.
