Cure
Blood veil takes its name from its most apparent symptoms: a rash and mask of blisters that cover the face. In its initial stages, the disease is characterized by headache, fatigue, coughing, and the aforementioned rash. As it progresses, the cough becomes more obtrusive; the rash spreads to the neck, face, and limbs and develops into poxlike blisters; and the lymph glands swell into painful buboes. At its most advanced stage, the blisters grow to the size of grapes or larger, internal bleeding creates black patches on the skin, and the victim expectorates blood. Ultimately, a bloody, wheezing death occurs. If left untreated, blood veil kills the average human in 7 days.
