Type regional curse; Save Will DC 13
Effect Up to three hazards (see the <a href="rules14f3.html?Name=Horror%20Hazards&amp;Category=Horror%20Environments">Horror Environments</a> section), each of CR 3 or less, imperil creatures in the area, though never with more than one hazard at a time. If a creature places this curse, it can choose the hazards. The hazards must be appropriate to the type of terrain (at the GM's discretion). Any of the hazards that are rendered safe reset themselves and become dangerous again at each midnight.
