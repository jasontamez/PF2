Effect A building can take on a life of its own if enough memories, fears, or other strong emotions become bound up in it. Such a building seeks to force residents to stay and either keep it company, serve it, protect it, or feed its unearthly hungers. The jealous structure is similar to a building-sized intelligent magic item of any evil alignment with Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 16, fast healing 5, and the ability to use the following spell-like abilities at caster level 11th a minimum of the number of times per day listed below: 3/day-<a href="spelldisplay72da.html?ItemName=animate%20objects">animate objects</a> (furniture only), <a href="spelldisplaycd0c.html?ItemName=fear">heightened fear (DC 19)</a>, <a href="spelldisplay83a8.html?ItemName=telekinesis">heightened telekinesis</a> (unattended objects only; DC 19); 1/day-<a href="spelldisplaye025.html?ItemName=guards%20and%20wards">guards and wards</a>.
