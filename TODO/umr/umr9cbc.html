Creatures with this ability automatically detect and locate conscious creatures within the specified range (usually 60 feet). This ability functions similarly to blindsight. <a href="spelldisplayaa3c.html?ItemName=Nondetection">Nondetection</a>, <a href="spelldisplaybd0b.html?ItemName=mind%20blank">mind blank</a>, and similar effects can block thoughtsense. Thoughtsense can distinguish between sentient (Intelligence 3 or greater) and nonsentient (Intelligence 1-2) creatures, but otherwise provides no information about the creatures it detects.

Format: thoughtsense 60 ft.
Location: Senses.
