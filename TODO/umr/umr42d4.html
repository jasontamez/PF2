The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the <a href="spellsb18c.html?Class=Sorcerer">sorcerer/wizard spell list</a>. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses the higher of its Intelligence or Charisma modifiers to determine its spell DCs.

Format: simple arcane spellcasting
