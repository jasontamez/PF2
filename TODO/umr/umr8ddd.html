A creature with this special quality can attempt to capsize a boat or a ship by ramming it as a charge attack and attempting a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the creature attempting to capsize it, the creature attempting to capsize the ship takes a cumulative -10 penalty on its combat maneuver check.

Format: capsize
Location: Special Attacks.
