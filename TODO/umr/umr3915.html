All plants within a 1-mile radius of the creature grow at double their normal rate and don't suffer from any diseases or maladies. Allied plant creatures within 30 feet of the creature gain fast healing equal to the creature's mythic rank. If the creature uses <a href="spelldisplay5178.html?ItemName=plant%20shape%20I">plant shape</a> or wild shape to take the form of a plant, it gains this fast healing in plant form.
