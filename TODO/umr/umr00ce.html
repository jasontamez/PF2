The creature can inflict a curse upon its enemies. The effects, including its save, frequency, and cure, are included in the creature's description. If a curse allows a saving throw, it is usually a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the cursing creature's racial HD + that creature's Charisma modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text). Curses can be removed through <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> and similar effects.
