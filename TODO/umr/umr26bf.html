Formians are a spacefaring race of insectlike creatures from a forest world that aggressively colonize other worlds. A formian possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Darkvision 60 feet and blindsense 30 feet. </li><li>Hive Mind (Ex) Formians share a telepathic bond with other members of their hive that enhances their hive mates' perception. As long as a formian is within telepathic range of at least one hive mate, it gains a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks and Perception checks. If at least one formian disbelieves an illusion, all formians within its telepathic range are also considered to disbelieve that illusion. If one formian is aware of combatants, all other hive mates within the range of its telepathy are also aware of those combatants. </li><li>Resistance to sonic 10. </li><li>Telepathic Caster (Ex) Due to a formian's telepathic nature, if it casts spells it does so as spell-like abilities. </li><li>Telepathy 60 ft.</li></ul>
