A creature affected by the burn ability must also succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire, taking the listed damage for an additional 1d4 rounds at the start of its turn (DC = 10 + 1/2 burning creature's racial HD + burning creature's Constitution modifier). A creature suffering from this effect can attempt a new save as a fullround action. Dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +4 bonus on this save. Creatures that hit a burning creature with natural weapons or unarmed attacks take fire damage as though hit by the burning creature and must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid <a href="rulesb1a4.html?Name=Catching%20on%20Fire&amp;Category=Heat%20Dangers">catching on fire</a>.
