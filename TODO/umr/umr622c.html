A creature with a vulnerability takes half again as much damage (+50%) from a specific energy type, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed or the save is a success or failure. Creatures with a vulnerability that is not an energy type instead take a -4 penalty on saves against spells and effects that cause or use the listed vulnerability (such as spells with the light descriptor). Some creatures might suffer additional effects, as noted in their descriptions.

Format: vulnerable to fire
Location: Weaknesses.
