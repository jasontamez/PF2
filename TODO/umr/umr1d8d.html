This attack happens automatically when a melee or ranged attack hits. Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative levels (the creature's description specifies how many). If the creature confirms a critical hit with an attack that includes energy drain, it inflicts twice the listed number of negative levels. Unless otherwise specified in the creature's description, a draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it inflicts on an opponent. These temporary hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour. Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell such as <a href="spelldisplay1364.html?ItemName=restoration">restoration</a>. If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 draining creature's racial HD + draining creature's Charisma modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text). On a success, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative level becomes permanent. A separate saving throw is required for each negative level.

Format: energy drain (2 levels, DC 18)
