If the creature is killed, it returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of the condition of its body or the means by which it was killed. When it returns to life, it isn't treated as if it had rested, and doesn't regain the use of abilities that are restored with rest until it next rests. This ability doesn't apply if the creature is killed by a coup de grace or critical hit performed by either a mythic creature (or creature of even greater power) or a non-mythic creature wielding a weapon capable of bypassing epic damage reduction. If the creature is 10th mythic rank, it can be killed only by a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact. (This ability is called "immortal" in Mythic Adventures.)
