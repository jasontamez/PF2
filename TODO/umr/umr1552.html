The creature gains the ability to cast spells from the <a href="spells1fc9.html?Class=Cleric">cleric</a> or <a href="spellsa2e5.html?Class=Druid">druid</a> spell list. Select a number of spells with total spell levels equal to twice the creature's CR. No spell for this ability should have a level higher than 1 + 1/2 the creature's CR. A 0-level spell counts as 1/2 spell level toward this total. The creature can cast each of these spells once per day. Its caster level is equal to its Hit Dice. It uses its Wisdom or Charisma (whichever is higher) to determine its spell DCs.
