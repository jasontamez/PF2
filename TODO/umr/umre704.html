A qlippoth lord is a powerful, unique qlippoth that once ruled a region of the Abyss but has been forced to retreat to forgotten corners of reality deep in the Abyss. At the dawn of creation, qlippoth lords were powerful creatures, perhaps even on par with deities, but today they have dwindled to a pale shadow of that power. Still, they remain potent dangers to mortal life in the rare instances when they are encountered. All qlippoth lords are chaotic evil qlippoth in the range of CR 21 to CR 25. Qlippoth lords have a particular suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry), as summarized here. <ul><li>A qlippoth lord can grant spells to its worshipers as if it were a deity. A qlippoth lord's domains are Chaotic and Evil, plus two other domains and four subdomains relevant to its theme and interests. Like a deity, a qlippoth lord has a favored weapon. </li><li>A qlippoth lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Horrific Appearance (Su) This ability functions similarly to the typical qlippoth ability, save that a qlippoth lord's horrific appearance creates physical effects and changes in its victims. Despite these physical effects, a qlippoth lord's horrific appearance remains a mind-affecting effect. </li><li>Immunity to cold, death effects, mind-affecting effects, and poison. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex) Lawful damage interrupts a qlippoth lord's regeneration. </li><li>Resistance to acid 30, electricity 30, and fire 30. </li><li>Summon Qlippoth (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, a qlippoth lord can summon any combination of qlippoth whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the <a href="umread1.html?ItemName=Summon">summon</a> universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success, and it counts as a 9th-level spell effect. </li><li>Telepathy 300 feet.</li></ul>
