A Horseman is a powerful, unique daemon that rules a major portion of Abaddon and personifies Death, Famine, Pestilence, or War. All Horsemen are evil outsiders that are, at a minimum, CR 27. Horsemen have a particular suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry) as summarized here. <ul><li>A Horseman can grant spells to its worshipers as if it were a deity. A Horseman's domains are Evil and three other domains and four subdomains relevant to its theme and interests. Like a deity, a Horseman has a favored weapon. </li><li>A Horseman's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as epic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Apocalyptic Resurrection (Ex) If a Horseman is killed, its body withers away into rot and corruption, leaving behind any gear it held or carried, while it is immediately restored to life (as per <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a>) in a location of its choice in its domain. A Horseman can't use this ability again for 1 year and avoids direct combat if possible until that year has passed. If slain again within 1 year or if killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity, an artifact created for this purpose, or another Horseman), a Horseman is slain forever. When this occurs, the CRs of the three remaining Horsemen immediately increase by 1 (typically via gaining a few Hit Dice and perhaps increasing some ability scores by 2 to 4 points), while an entirely new Horseman ascends to the vacant role as a CR 27 demigod with its own unique abilities. </li><li>Frightful Presence (Su) A Horseman can activate its frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, spell-like ability, or special attack, or by speaking aloud. </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, acid, charm effects, compulsion effects, death effects, disease, energy drain, petrification, and poison. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex) Only mythic damage or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as an archdevil, a deity, an empyreal lord, a Great Old One, a Horseman, or a qlippoth lord) interrupts a Horseman's regeneration. </li><li>Resistance to cold 30, electricity 30, and fire 30. </li><li>Summon Daemon (Sp) Three times per day as a swift action, a Horseman can summon any daemon or combination of daemons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the <a href="umread1.html?ItemName=Summon">summon</a> universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success, and it counts as a 9th-level spell effect. </li><li>Telepathy 300 feet.</li></ul>
