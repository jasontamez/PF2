Some creatures can exhale a cloud, cone, or line of magical effects. A breath weapon usually deals damage and is often based on some type of energy. Breath weapons allow a Reflex save for half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 breathing creature's racial HD + breathing creature's Constitution modifier; the exact DC is given in the creature's descriptive text). A creature is immune to its own breath weapon unless otherwise noted. Some breath weapons allow a Fortitude save or a Will save instead of a Reflex save. Each breath weapon also includes notes on how often it can be used.

Format: breath weapon (60-ft. cone, 8d6 fire damage, Reflex DC 20 for half, usable every 1d4 rounds)
Location: Special Attacks; if the breath does more than just deal damage, it also appears under Special Abilities with its own entry.
