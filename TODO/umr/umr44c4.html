An archdevil rules a domain in Hell. Archdevils are lawful evil outsiders with a minimum CR of 26. Archdevils share the following traits and have the devil subtype (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>An archdevil can grant spells as if it were a deity. Each archdevil has a favored weapon and grants the Evil and Law domains, plus two other domains and four subdomains. </li><li>An archdevil's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as epic, evil, and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Frightful Presence (Su): An archdevil can activate its frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, special attack, or spell-like ability, or by speaking aloud. </li><li>Infernal Resurrection (Ex): If an archdevil is killed, its body crumbles into ashes, leaving behind any gear it held or carried, while it is immediately restored to life (as per <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a>) in a location of its choosing in its domain. An archdevil can't use this ability again for 1 year, and it avoids direct combat if possible until that year has passed. If slain again or killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose), an archdevil is slain forever. An archdevil who does not control a domain does not gain this ability (and is technically an infernal duke rather than a true archdevil). </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, charm, compulsion, death effects, energy drain, and petrification. </li><li>Language Mastery (Ex): An archdevil knows all languages, as though using a <a href="spelldisplay4d62.html?ItemName=tongues">tongues</a> spell, although this ability is not supernatural and cannot be dispelled. Linguistics is always a class skill for an archdevil. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex): Only mythic damage or damage from a creature of equal or greater standing (such as another archdevil, deity, empyreal lord, Great Old One, Horseman, or qlippoth lord) interrupts an archdevil's regeneration. </li><li>Resistance to acid 30 and cold 30. </li><li>Summon Devils (Sp): Three times per day as a swift action, an archdevil can summon any devil or combination of devils whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the <a href="umread1.html?ItemName=Summon">summon</a> universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success, and it counts as a 9th-level spell effect. </li><li>Telepathy 300 feet.</li></ul>
