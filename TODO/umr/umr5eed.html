Using nonvisual senses, such as sensitivity to vibrations, keen smell, acute hearing, or echolocation, a creature with blindsight can maneuver and fight as well as a sighted creature. Invisibility, darkness, and most kinds of concealment are irrelevant, though a creature with blindsight must have line of effect to an object or another creature to discern that object or creature. The ability's range is specified in the creature's descriptive text. The creature usually does not need to succeed at Perception checks to notice creatures within range of its blindsight ability. Unless noted otherwise, blindsight is continuous, and the creature doesn't need to do anything to use it. Some forms of blindsight, however, must be triggered as a free action. If so, this is noted in the creature's description. If a creature must trigger its blindsight ability, it gains the benefits of blindsight only during its turn.
