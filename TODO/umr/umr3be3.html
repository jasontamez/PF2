Constructs are immune to death effects, disease, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms), necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep, stun, and any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects or is harmless). Constructs are not subject to ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, or nonlethal damage. Constructs are not at risk of death from taking massive damage.
