These spells manipulate the lingering spiritual energy suffusing an area or surrounding an object into semi-autonomous magical effects. Haunted spells function like regular spells, but those with ongoing durations can be neutralized as though they were haunts as they take effect. The statistics for each spell's haunt-like manifestation are listed at the end of the spell's other statistics.

Events during a haunted spell's duration may cause its haunt-like manifestation to reoccur during that round, causing a surprise round if combat has not yet begun. These manifestations grant victims and their allies additional chances to notice and neutralize the haunted spell before it takes effect. These additional manifestations do not allow new saving throws to negate the spell.

Since haunted spells derive their power from ambient emotional energy, a given area or object can host only one haunted spell at a time. Most haunted spells have shapeable areas of effect, which can be molded to fit the areas where they are cast, and their effects target all creatures in the area when the haunted spell manifests. Once a haunted spell is cast on an area or object, it remains in place for 1 week or until it is activated, triggering its haunt-like manifestation. Once an area or object hosts a haunted spell, it cannot host another haunted spell for at least 7 days after the first one activates. A single area or object cannot host a haunted spell and a regular haunt at the same time. As long as a haunted spell remains latent in an area, its caster can't prepare a new spell in that slot or regain that spell slot. When the haunted spell triggers, the caster can sense it but gains no insight or information about what triggered the haunt beyond what he can directly observe. A caster can dismiss a haunted spell as a swift action in order to prepare a new spell in that slot or to regain a spell slot; doing so causes the haunted spell to dissipate.

Haunted spells don't have histories like regular haunts do, so effects that reveal such information merely expose that the haunted spell is a magical effect.
