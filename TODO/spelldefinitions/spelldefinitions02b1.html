Definition Type Descriptor
Spells with the draconic descriptor were created by dragons in ages long past, and still resonate within the blood of true dragons to this day. Creatures of the dragon type with 5 or more racial hit dice can select a draconic spell as a spell known regardless of the class spell list it's on. Each time such a creature gains an additional racial hit die, it can select a draconic spell in place of an existing spell known of the same or higher spell level.
