<a href="psitechdisplay3306.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Battery">Psychic Battery</a> (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 13</a>): You can expend an unused spell slot or a number of points from your phrenic pool as a swift action to power a technological device you are touching. Each spell level expended in this way grants the device 1 charge, and every 2 points from your phrenic pool spent grant 1 charge. Any charges unused at the end of the round are lost, and any charges used by the device that round that aren't provided by you must come from the device's own power reserves. You cannot use this ability to power timeworn technology. You can power only devices that use charges. You must be at least 7th level to select this discovery.
