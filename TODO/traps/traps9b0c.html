Effects

Trigger location; Reset manual
Effect Rigged to boulders, logs, or other heavy weights in canopies or on ledges, a trip line strung across an area can create a deadly trap. When a creature enters the deadfall's trigger square, the weights drop in a 20-foot line or a 10-foot-square area, affecting four 5-foot squares in all. Each creature in this area takes 4d6 points of damage and is knocked prone. With a successful DC 20 Reflex save, a target takes half the damage and avoids being knocked prone.
