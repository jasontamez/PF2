Because kobolds identify so passionately with dragons, they strive to reinforce their connection through names that reflect their draconic heritage. Kobold birth names are relatively short, usually consisting of two syllables, and are almost always faintly reminiscent of dragons' names.

To further emulate their draconic brethren, kobolds change their names to longer and more complex forms as they reach important age milestones, perform spectacular acts, or attain notable achievements. Kobold adventurers often add more syllables to their names upon reaching significant points in their careers-every 5 levels or so.

Kobolds rarely have surnames; most instead use clan names or honorifics to identify themselves. Those kobolds who do use surnames are most often reinforcing a claim to a hereditary throne or attempting to adhere to regional or cultural inf luences.

Male Names: Athraz, Dyrtrax, Fazij, Grytnok, Jekkajak, Kaidynn, Keegyn, Kirrok, Merlokrep, Nydryn, Nyktox, Ryzztyl, Torphrex, Varrann, Vreknog, Xahndyg

Female Names: Ahmmra, Azzlyn, Enga, Grymwyr, Gynnezz, Kregnaan, Jynnjun, Lyrtrahk, Melrynn, Petrahk, Ryzzntyg, Skyxa, Tyrrell, Varshez, Vregma, Zarrnyl

Kobold Alternate Racial Traits



Replaces Armor

Dragon Affinity
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 216</a>
Kobold sorcerers with the draconic bloodline or kobold bloodline (Advanced Race Guide 134) treat their Charisma scores as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. This racial trait replaces the armor trait.

Dragonmaw
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
Your draconic heritage makes you smile-
not just because it makes you happy, but also because
your powerful jaws and teeth are proof of your kinship to
a chromatic dragon. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4
points of damage. Once per day, you can deal 1d6 points
of additional energy damage with your bite attack. The
damage type depends on your scale color: acid damage
for black or green, electricity for blue, fire for red, or cold
for white. If you have a different scale color, you still gain
the bite attack, but can't do the additional energy damage.
This racial trait replaces the armor racial trait.


Dragon-Scaled
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 132</a>
Some kobolds are hatched with scales of such vivid color that their connection to a particular sort of chromatic dragon seems undeniable. Whether this coloration is just a quirk of a stray egg or a trait shared by all the members of a tribe, these kobolds gain a resistance that makes them especially suited to work alongside dragons matching the color of the kobold's scales. Black-scaled and green-scaled kobolds with this racial trait gain acid resistance 5. Blue-scaled kobolds with this racial trait gain electricity resistance 5. Red-scaled kobolds with this racial trait gain fire resistance 5. White-scaled kobolds with this racial trait gain cold resistance 5. This racial trait replaces the armor racial trait.

Frightener
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
Like the great dragons, you can strike fear
in the hearts of your foes with your majestic presence.
Few enemies suspect that you make yourself look more
dangerous with simple tricks you learned back when
you were newly hatched. You gain a +1 racial bonus to the
DC of saving throws against spells you cast with the fear
descriptor. This racial trait replaces the armor racial trait.


Prehensile Tail
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
Your tail is especially f lexible and
strong, so you've learned to use it for both movement and
simple tricks. You gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics
and Climb checks, and you can use your tail to draw a
hidden weapon as a move action instead of as a standard
action. This racial trait replaces the armor racial trait.



Replaces Crafty

Beast Bond
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 132</a>

Echo Whistler
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
By observing the noises in underground
tunnels, you learned to uncannily mimic any voice or sound
you heard. Three times per day, you can attempt to trick
someone in this way by making a Bluff check against the
listener's Sense Motive check. You get a +2 circumstance
bonus on this check if you're in tunnels or other structures
where your voice can echo. This racial trait replaces crafty.

Gliding Wings
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 133</a>
Some kobolds are born with wings that, while too weak for actual flying, do allow them to fall at a very slow and safe pace. A kobold with wings can use them to glide. It can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using feather fall. When falling safely, it may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet it falls. This racial trait replaces crafty.

Jester
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 133</a>
Some kobolds swallow their pride and survive by groveling, placating, and amusing the powerful. Kobolds with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Perform checks. Diplomacy and Perform are always class skills for them. This racial trait replaces crafty.

Secret Strider
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
You have the ability to traverse the
wilderness without a trace. Twice per day, you can move

Shoulder to Shoulder

Having lived and worked in close
quarters with your tribe-mates, you've learned how to
maneuver within their personal space without disturbing
them. You can occupy the same space as one other Small
ally without penalty. If you share a space with another
kobold who has this trait, you each gain a +1 circumstance
bonus to AC, as you help jostle one another out of the way
of incoming attacks. You also gain a +1 racial bonus on aid
another rolls. This racial trait replaces crafty.


Spellcaster Sneak
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
Traversing the tunnels near big, nasty,
hungry creatures, you learned to keep quiet-and to keep
your spells quiet too. You gain a +2 racial bonus on Stealth
checks, and once per day you can gain the benefit of the Silent
Spell feat on a spell you cast. This racial trait replaces crafty.

always class skills for you.

Wyrmcrowned
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
Your horns have grown to the extent
that they appear similar to those of a dragon who shares
your scale color, lending a draconic power or menace to
your dealings with others. Choose either Diplomacy or
Intimidate. You gain a +2 racial bonus on checks with that
skill, and it is always a class skill for you. This racial trait
replaces crafty.


Replaces Light Sensitivity, Darkvision

Day Raider
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Kobolds-of-Golarion">Kobolds of Golarion pg. 7</a>
You're one of the few kobolds born with a
greater tolerance for sunlight. You don't have light sensitivity,
and you have low-light vision instead of darkvision.
