Sometimes a samsaran perishes under especially dramatic emotional circumstances, causing its soul to wander the Ethereal Plane before finally reincarnating. This spirit journey frays the samsaran's connection to his past lives but strengthens his ability to read others' pasts and present.

Reborn Samsaran Racial Traits

Reborn samsarans are defined by their class levels-they don't have racial Hit Dice. All reborn samsarans have the following racial traits.

+2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Constitution: Reborn samsarans are insightful and learn quickly, but their bodies tend to be frail.
Medium: Reborn samsarans are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.
Normal Speed: Reborn samsarans have a base speed of 30 feet.
Low-Light Vision: Reborn samsarans can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.
Psychic Attunement: Reborn samsarans receive <a href="featdisplay0478.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Virtuoso">Psychic Virtuoso</a> as a bonus feat at 1st level. Those who can't use <a href="rules79d0.html?Name=Occult%20Skill%20Unlocks&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">occult skill unlocks</a> at 1st level instead gain the <a href="featdisplayfc3c.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Sensitivity">Psychic Sensitivity feat</a> as a bonus feat.
Reborn Magic: A reborn samsaran with a Charisma score of 11 or higher can cast the following spells (as per the psychic magic universal monster rule [see page 2], using his Charisma modifier to determine the DCs): burst of insight (1 PE), detect psychic significance (0 PE), object reading (2 PE), and psychic reading (1 PE). The caster level is equal to the reborn samsaran's level. The reborn samsaran has a reservoir of 5 PE per day.
Special Qualities: A reborn samsaran gains the following special qualities.
Aura Transparency: A reborn samsaran has difficulty hiding his psychic signatures. The DC of any skill check made to read his aura decreases by 5, and the check takes one-tenth as long as normal to perform.
Psychic Learning: When a reborn samsaran expends psychic energy to cast psychic reading to identify a humanoid's class, he temporarily treats two of the target's class skills as if they were class skills for him. He can use these skills untrained and gains a +2 insight bonus on such checks. These benefits last for 24 hours or until the reborn samsaran spends psychic energy to cast psychic reading again.
Languages: Reborn samsarans begin play speaking Common and Samsaran. Those reborn samsarans with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: any human language, Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, and Terran.
