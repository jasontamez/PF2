Early humans were far more primitive than their modern descendants. While they still had the capacity to create great works of art and solve complex problems, the reality of their existence meant that most had to fight for survival on a daily basis. As a result, primitive humans devoted more of their time to honing the basic skills of to avoid predators and gather food than to higher-minded pursuits. This prevented them from becoming as versatile as modern humans.

Physical Description: While quite varied in terms of height, skin tone, and body types, most primitive humans stand about 6 inches shorter than their modern descendants. In addition, most have a great deal of body hair and are generally unkempt. Most have a tan skin complexion due to an excessive amount of time spent outdoors, gathering food and hunting prey.

Society: Primitive humans live in small clans ruled over either by the clan's elders or its most brutal and warlike members. Such clans usually span only a few generations with members frequently mixing with those from other nearby clans. Occasionally a number of clans will band together or gather for a large moot, but such unifications are short-lived unless held together by a particularly powerful or charismatic leader.

Relations: Primitive humans are fearful of most other races, and this fear often drives them to violence when they come in contact with such outsiders. To them, there is little difference between an elf and a goblin; both are a threat to the clan. They view half-orcs and half-elves with distrust, but some have been known to accept such exotic kin into their fold, occasionally even viewing them as superior, thus placing them in a position of importance.

Alignment and Religion: Primitive humans rarely follow any set of laws other than those of the tribe, and even these are often quite flexible. Likewise, codified concepts of good and evil are somewhat extreme for these simple folk, who often spend most of their time just trying to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. There are exceptions of course'some primitive humans strive to help their fellows, and others embrace total barbarism and wanton destruction. Most primitive humans have only a simple understanding of religion, worshiping the forces of nature and spirits of the world around them. They are known to make offerings and sacrifices to placate their deities and garner their favor.

Adventurers: While most primitive humans stay with their clans, some set out on their own to explore the world, and still others are forced out due to some conflict or misdeed. These outcasts sometimes join up with others to improve their chances of survival or to form a group more capable of taking on dangerous challenges.

Male Names: Arn, Bak, Farg, Gon, Merd, Oog, Tral, Ugg.

Female Names: Ala, Desa, Fola, Ili, Hoda, Marg, Sus, Ula.
