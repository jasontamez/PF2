Kitsune, or fox folk, are vulpine shapeshifters known for their love of both trickery and art. Kitsune possess two forms: that of an attractive human of slender build with salient eyes, and their true form of an anthropomorphic fox. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, kitsune prize loyalty and make true companions. They delight in the arts, particularly riddles and storytelling, and settle in ancestral clans, taking their wisdom from both the living and spirits.

Quick-witted and nimble, kitsune make excellent bards and rogues. It is not uncommon for one to pursue sorcery, while those few born with white fur and pale eyes usually become oracles.

Keen Kitsune

Although amiable, kitsune are notoriously clever and cunning, often far more than they seem. Such characters gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence instead of Dexterity and Charisma. This racial trait alters the kitsune's ability score modifiers.


Replaces Agile

Gregarious (Ex)
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 192</a>
Even among your own kind, your gift for making friends stands out. Whenever you successfully use Diplomacy to win over an individual, that creature takes a -2 penalty to resist any of your Charisma-based skill checks for the next 24 hours. This racial trait replaces agile.


Replaces Agile, Kitsune Magic

Skilled

Although most kitsune speak only Common, some quickly learn other human languages in order to give themselves an edge when dealing with humanity. They speak Common, Senzar, and the racial language of their human form's ethnicity, and they can learn any language they want (except Druidic and other secret languages) if they have high Intelligence scores. This racial trait replaces agile as well as a kitsune's normal languages.


Replaces Kitsune Magic

Duplicitous

Some talented kitsune take more naturally to shapeshifting than magic, and develop that gift. They gain Fox Shape (Pathfinder Player Companion: Dragon Empires Primer 5) as a bonus feat at 1st level, ignoring its prerequisites. This racial trait replaces kitsune magic.
