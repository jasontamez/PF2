Monster Entry Link
Born of mysterious origins and raised by unknowing foster parents, changelings are the children of hags and their tricked lovers. Most do not know of their monstrous origins, but there comes a time in every changeling's life when these roots begin to call out to their host, urging the confused girl toward some end she cannot identify.

Changelings are always female, tall, and slender. A changeling's hair is typically dark and her skin abnormally pale, but she otherwise looks for all practical purposes like a member of her father's race. A frequent but not universal trait of changelings is their mismatched, different-colored eyes. Upon reaching puberty and adulthood, the average changeling stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 110 pounds.

Crawling Skin (Blood Hag): The changeling gains a +2 bonus on Disguise checks made to look like specific individuals.
Dead Eyes (Mute Hag): One of the changeling's eyes is a solid, dead black (with no whites even at its edges); this gives her a +2 bonus on all saves against gaze attacks and visual illusions.

Changeling Covens

The hag blood coursing through changelings' veins makes them especially adept at coven magic. Changeling witches with the coven hex can form covens of three changelings without the usual need for a hag member. But as a changeling draws upon the power of her heritage, the call to wander into her hag mother's clutches becomes more persistent; changelings who form a coven only with other changelings take a -1 penalty on Will saving throws due to this increased stress.

Changeling witches with the coven hex who wish to form a coven must perform a 1-hour ritual. When the ritual is complete, the changeling coven gains access to the following spell-like abilities based on the witch level of their lowestlevel participant.

1st Level: disguise other, fog cloud; 3rd Level: bestow curse; 5th Level: speak with dead; 7th Level: baleful polymorph; 9th Level: mirage arcana; 11th Level: forcecage; 13th Level: commune; 15th Level: control weather; 17th Level: vision; 19th Level: mind blank.

Coven spells use the caster level of the coven's most powerful witch. They require each member of the coven to participate simultaneously, taking a full-round action or the spell's normal casting time to cast, whichever is longer. A changeling coven can cast a total of three coven spells each day, regardless of the spell level.

Some changelings develop a gift for spellcasting instead of their mothers' overtly fearsome traits. A changeling with this trait displays one or more stark white streaks in her hair as a child. The DCs of any saving throws against enchantment spells she casts increase by 1, and if her Charisma score is 11 or higher, she also gains the following spell-like abilities, usable once per day each: dancing lights, detect magic, disguise self, and pass without trace. The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the changeling's character level.

The following options are available to all Changelings who have the listed favored class.

Oracle (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 184</a>): Add +1/2 to the oracle's level for the purpose of determining the effects of the oracle's curse ability.
