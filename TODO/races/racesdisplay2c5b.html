Deep one hybrids are the spawn of humans and deep ones. They are most comfortable with others of their kind, and typically cluster in small, insular settlements where they can assume positions of authority. They keep any humans within their towns subservient and cowed, making sure those other residents know better than to act against local laws. Though deep ones are devoutly religious, they usually cloak their true beliefs under a facade of more conventional worship, believing that by doing so they can avoid suspicion from visitors and nearby societies.

Deep One Hybrid Racial Traits

Deep one hybrids are defined by their class levels-they don't possess racial Hit Dice. All deep one hybrids have the following racial traits.
+2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Dexterity: Deep one hybrids are hearty and devout, but tend to be somewhat slow and awkward in their movements.
Slow: A deep one hybrid's base speed is 20 feet, as it walks with a shuffling gait.
Low-Light Vision: A deep one hybrid can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of dim light.
Natural Armor: A deep one hybrid's thick skin and dense fatty tissues grant it a +1 natural armor bonus to AC.
Final Change (Su): A deep one hybrid ages at the same rate as a half-orc. A mere 1d12 months after a deep one hybrid reaches venerable age (at 60 years old), it dies a painful, agonizing death, only to have its body transform into that of a mature deep one. This transformation functions as the reincarnate spell, with the newly formed deep one gaining the following modifications to its physical ability scores: +6 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and +6 Constitution.
Sea Longing (Ex): Every 24 hours a deep one hybrid spends in an area more than 10 miles from the sea, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 1 point of Wisdom drain.
Take to the Water (Ex): A deep one hybrid can hold its breath 10 times longer than a human can, and gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks and Reflex saving throws while swimming. A deep one hybrid has a swim speed of 30 feet, and gains a +8 racial bonus on all Swim checks.
Languages: Deep one hybrids begin play speaking Aklo and Common. Hybrids with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Undercommon.
