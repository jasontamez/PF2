Acrobatic

Vanaras are often extraordinarily agile, capable of dancing around slower-moving humans with playful grace. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Escape Artist checks. This racial trait replaces nimble.

Change Size (Su)

One vanara in every 500 is gifted with limited shapeshifting ability. Such a creature can adjust her size at will. She gains the change shape ability and the shapeshifter subtype. Instead of changing appearance, she can use change shape to reduce her size category to Small. Her ability scores don't change, only her size (and thus her weapon damage); normal size penalties and bonuses to AC and CMD and on attack and skill rolls apply. Changing size or returning to her true size is a fullround action. This racial trait alters the vanara's type and replaces nimble.


Replaces Normal Speed

Some vanaras have spent their lives among humans in centers of learning instead of traditional treetop homes. These vanaras treat all Knowledge skills as class skills, but lose their climb speed racial trait.


Replaces Prehensile Tail

Risky Troublemaker

Vanara families who seek to emulate the Monkey King teach their members that unexpected opportunities are worth taking great risks. These vanaras can choose to roll twice on Use Magic Device checks. If they do, they take the higher result unless either die roll is a natural 1, in which case the check automatically fails. This racial trait replaces prehensile tail.

Whitecape

The rare whitecape vanara clans have more in common with savanna-dwelling baboons than the jungle-dwelling monkeys that most vanaras resemble. Their stooping build grants them a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip. These vanaras usually have a thick mane of hair on the head and shoulders (called a "cape") and shorter tails. This racial trait replaces prehensile tail.
