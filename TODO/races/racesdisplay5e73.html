The nagaji are a race of ophidian humanoids with scaled skin that mimics the dramatic appearance of true nagas. Like serpents, they have forked tongues and lidless eyes, giving them an unblinking gaze that most other races find unnerving. Their physical forms are otherwise humanlike, raising wary speculation about their origins. It is widely believed that true nagas created them as a servitor race, through crossbreeding, magic, or both, and indeed nagaji revere nagas as living gods. Nagaji often inspire awe and fear among other humanoids, as much for their mysterious ancestry as for their talent for both swords and sorcery.

Nagaji clerics with this racial trait and the Scalykind domain (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 216) use their domain powers and spells at +1 caster level. This increase is a racial bonus. This racial trait replaces resistant.


Replaces Serpent's Sense

Hypnotic Gaze (Sp)
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 196</a>
The nagaji's gaze is so intense it stops others in their tracks. Once per day, it can attempt to hypnotize a single target, as per the spell hypnotism (caster level equal to the nagaji's Hit Dice). The DC of this effect is equal to 11 + the nagaji's Charisma modifier. The effects of the hypnotic gaze only last a single round. This racial trait replaces serpent's sense.


Nagaji Favored Class Options

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, Nagaji have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.

The following options are available to all Nagaji who have the listed favored class.

Alchemist (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 196</a>): Add +1 on Craft (alchemy) checks to craft poison and +1/3 on the DCs of poisons the alchemist creates.
Cavalier (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 16</a>): Add 1 foot to the base speed of the cavalier's mount. This has no effect in combat unless the cavalier has selected this reward five times (or another increment of five). If the cavalier ever replaces this mount, the new mount gains this bonus to its speed.
Fighter (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 196</a>): Add +1 to the fighter's CMD when resisting a grapple or trip attempt.
Mesmerist (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 16</a>): Add 1/5 to the Hit-Die limit and the total number of Hit Die affected with each enchantment or illusion spell the mesmerist casts. This bonus stacks with the mesmerist's mental potency class feature and is applicable under the same conditions as that ability.
Monk (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 196</a>): Add +1/4 point to the monk's ki pool.

Ranger (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 16</a>): Add 1 skill rank to the ranger's constrictor snake or viper snake animal companion.

Summoner (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 196</a>): Add +1 hit point to the summoner's eidolon.
Warpriest (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 16</a>): Add 1/2 to the number of times per day the warpriest can use blessings, although he can use these additional blessings only for Charm, Magic, Nobility, Rune, or Scalykind (Pathfinder Player Companion: Advanced Class Origins 25) blessings.
