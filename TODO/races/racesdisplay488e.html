From lofty monastery-cities entrenched in soaring cliff sides and high mountain valleys, the syrinx seek to bring peace to all lands that fall within sight of their marbled spires. Erudite and aloof, the owl-like scholars embrace art, philosophy, and nebulous faiths, seeking to distance themselves from a history of barbarism and ruin. To this end, they seek to enslave all lesser races, especially those without wings. Their elitist culture rests upon thousands of backs in an elaborate hierarchy of slaves. Directly below the syrinx are the strix, a race they magically modified in the distant past to serve as warriors and slave masters.

Syrinxes often have a natural talent for sensing how to unsettle and oppress other creatures. As a swift action, a syrinx can attempt a Sense Motive check against a DC of 10 + a creature's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier or a DC of 10 + the creature's Bluff modifier, whichever is higher. On a success, syrinx gains a +4 racial bonus on Intimidate checks against that target and a +1 racial bonus to the DC of any fear effects she uses against that target. This racial trait replaces nocturnal and pride.
