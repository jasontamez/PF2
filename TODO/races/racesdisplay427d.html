Writing Eye

Some vine leshys can grow thin vines that serve as sensory organs. Growing or controlling the vine is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The vine can extend up to 15 feet and is small enough to pass through a keyhole. A leshy can perceive, using all of her senses, within 20 feet of the vine's tip.

This replaces darkvision and low-light vision.


Replaces Pass without Trace, Plantspeech

Curosity
Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01w1y">Wilderness Origins pg. 14</a>
Vine leshys bearing gregarious spirits are more suited to learn about other cultures. They always treat Diplomacy and Linguistics as class skills, and they gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Linguistics checks.

This replaces pass without trace and plantspeech.


Replaces Plantspeech; Change Shape

Poisonous
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 21</a>
Vine leshys made from poison ivy vines carry natural poison in their bodies. As a swift action, the leshy can imbue its vines with this irritating substance. The next time the leshy hits a creature with an unarmed strike, the creature is affected by the following poison.

Vine Leshy Toxin: Unarmed strike-injury; save Fort DC 10 + half the vine leshy's Hit Dice + the leshy's Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect sickened for 1 round; cure 1 save.

The leshy can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). A vine leshy is immune to its own poison, but not to those of other vine leshys.

This replaces plantspeech and change shape.
