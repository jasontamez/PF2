Sahuagin (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 239) are well known and feared among aquatic races. These piscine predators are cruel and vicious, and they see all other creatures as either competitors or prey. The sole exception is the shark- sahuagin are rarely found without semidomesticated sharks nearby, as they feel a close bond with these other predators of the sea and both creatures are used to hunting ruthlessly alongside each other.

Although sahuagin usually gather together in tight-knit tribes, an individual sahuagin might decide to pursue glory on her own, perhaps seeking a powerful artifact or a richer hunting ground.

Outsear Sahuagin

The settlement of Outsea is a bizarre environment: a saltwater oasis for merfolk and sahuagin in the freshwater River Kingdoms. Centuries ago, a sahuagin nation from the Inner Sea mobilized a city-sized saltwater bolus for an overland assault on a merfolk state located near modern-day Korvosa. The merfolk learned of this ambitious plan and sent an elite group of soldiers in saltwater tanks to intercept the ocean-bubble. The two sides clashed in Lake Encarthan and eventually worked their way up into what is now the River Kingdoms. In this battle, many of the wizards maintaining the sahuagin's briny mobile fortress perished, and the two sides ended up stranded hundreds of miles from any ocean. Begrudgingly putting aside their grievances, the merfolk and sahuagin worked together to prevent their mutual extinction, holding back the fresh water with spells and building the settlement of Outsea to serve as a permanent home. Now Outsea is a thriving city, home to all kinds of peoples. Centuries of coexistence have worn down the merfolk and sahuagin's hatred for each other, and now they live and work together in peace. Outsear sahuagin can take the sahuagin song and stoic defender alternate racial traits described below.
