Kasathas are a nomadic humanoid race from a desert world that orbits a red sun far beyond Golarion's own solar system. The kasathas of Golarion have a cultural tradition of exploration, and when they come of age, they leave their clan, usually for 1 year, then return to their people with any riches or knowledge acquired during their journeys. This ritual "tempering" allows young adults to undergo a period of self-discovery before they assume their adult responsibilities.

No one is quite sure how kasathas first came to Golarion-even the kasathas have differing accounts. The fact that they are primarily found in the wilds and hidden places of Numeria suggests that they have some relation to the androids and other strange beings of that savage land. Whether there is any truth to this, however, may never be known, thanks to the kasathas' secretive nature and lack of cultural memory.
