Sylph - Races







Smokesoul (Fume Sylph)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9z15?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-PlaneHopper-s-Handbook">Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 21</a>
Veiled and surreptitious, smokesoul sylphs are natural deceivers, always concealing their true intentions.

Typical Alignment CE
Ability Modifiers +2 Dex, +2 Cha, -2 Con
Alternate Spell-Like Ability Smokesouls gain <a href="spelldisplay6f6c.html?ItemName=blurred%20movement">blurred movement</a> as a spell-like ability.
Smoke Affinity This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base sylph's air affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the shadow bloodline and spellcasters with the Smoke subdomain.

Obfuscation, secrecy, and the shape of things not there: all these are the natural realms of smokesouls. They are experts at concealing both their bodies and motivations, and at making the insubstantial seem as real as any physical object. Smokesouls are drawn to areas of dangerous politics and intrigue, and many can be found in Nidal and Brevoy pursuing whatever machinations amuse them.

With few distinguishing features save ashen skin and dark hair, smokesouls can be mistaken for any number of other races. Smokesouls often change their clothing, cosmetics, or style to keep their appearance in a constant state of flux.



Stormsoul (Lightning Sylph)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9z15?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-PlaneHopper-s-Handbook">Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 21</a>
With an abundance of confidence and a shortage of patience, stormsoul sylphs are personalities who cannot be ignored.

Typical Alignment CN
Ability Modifiers +2 Dex, +2 Cha, -2 Wis
Alternate Spell-Like Ability Stormsouls gain <a href="spelldisplayd972.html?ItemName=shocking%20grasp">shocking grasp</a> as a spell-like ability.
Lightning Affinity This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base sylph's air affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the stormborn bloodline and spellcasters with the Weather domain.

When a stormsoul moves, either in word or in action, the world notices. Unafraid to speak their minds, they are both direct and unsubtle, and they make fierce allies. When friends are in need, stormsouls act without thinking and are always the first to leap to their aid.

A stormsoul sylph has hair that always seems to move, even when there is no breeze, and acts with a sudden intensity that can seem out of control. Their eyes are the color of stormy water or lightning-lit skies, and even a casual glance from a stormsoul can seem severe.



Sylph Alternate Racial Traits



Replaces Air Affinity

Air Insight
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 156</a>
Sylph spellcasters sometimes find that their elemental heritage makes creatures of air more willing to serve them. Summon monster and summon nature's ally spells that the sylph casts last 2 rounds longer than normal when used to summon creatures with the air subtype. This racial trait replaces air affinity.

Breeze-Kissed
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 156</a>
Breezes seem to follow most sylphs wherever they go, but some sylphs are better able to control these winds than others. A sylph with this racial trait surrounds herself with swirling winds, gaining a +2 racial bonus to AC against nonmagical ranged attacks. The sylph can calm or renew these winds as a swift action. Once per day, the sylph can channel this wind into a single gust, making a bull rush or trip combat maneuver attempt against one creature within 30 feet. Whether or not the attempt succeeds, the winds are exhausted and no longer provide a bonus to the sylph's AC for 24 hours. This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces air affinity.

Storm in the Blood
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 157</a>
A sylph with this racial trait gains fast healing 2 for 1 round anytime she takes electricity damage (whether or not this electricity damage gets through her electricity resistance). The sylph can heal up to 2 hit points per level per day with this ability, after which it ceases to function. This racial trait replaces air affinity.

Replaces Energy Resistance

Like the Wind
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 156</a>
A sylph with this racial trait gains a +5 foot bonus to her base speed. This racial trait replaces energy resistance.

Thunderous Resilience
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 157</a>
Sylphs with this racial trait gain sonic resistance 5. This racial trait replaces energy resistance.


Replaces Energy Resistance, Spell-Like Ability

Secretive
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 216</a>
Sylphs gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment and divination spells and effects. This racial trait replaces energy resistance and the spell-like ability racial trait.


Replaces Languages, Subtype, Type

Mostly Human
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 215</a>
A few ifrits, oreads, sulis, sylphs, and undines have appearances much closer to those of their human ancestors; in fact, they may not even realize their true race. Such geniekin appear to be human, save perhaps minor features like unusual eye color, and they count as humanoid (human) as well as outsider (native) for all purposes (such as humanoid-affecting spells such as charm person or enlarge person). These geniekin do not automatically gain their associated elemental language (but may select it as a bonus language if their Intelligence is high enough). This ability alters the geniekin's type, subtype, and languages.


Replaces Spell-Like Ability

Sky Speaker
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 156</a>
Sylphs with this racial trait feel kinship toward the creatures of the air, and can use speak with animals once per day to speak to birds or other flying animals. Her caster level for these effects is equal to her level. This racial trait replaces the sylph's spell-like ability racial trait.

Weather Savvy
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 157</a>
Some sylphs are so in tune with the air and sky that they can sense the slightest change in atmospheric conditions. Sylphs with this trait can spend a full-round action to predict the weather in an area for the next 24 hours. The sylph's prediction is always accurate, but cannot account for spells or supernatural effects that might alter the forecast. This racial trait replaces the sylph's spell-like ability racial trait.

Whispering Wind
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 157</a>
Some sylphs are especially thin and wispy, as though they were made more of air than flesh. Sylphs with this racial trait gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks. This racial trait replaces the sylph's spell-like ability racial trait.

The following options are available to all Sylphs who have the listed favored class.
