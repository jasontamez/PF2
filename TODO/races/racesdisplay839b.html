Death is more terrifying for those who have the best of life. Many rulers obsess over their mortality, the most brazen turning to the mystical arts, pouring their fears into splendid vessels, fashioning simulacra of themselves to bear the scourge of Pharasma's judgment. In the mortal world, these icons are nothing but gold with a ruler's face and name, but in death, they are shabti.

Existing as something between mortal souls, fabricated beings, and true children of the planes, shabti are immortal facsimiles of death-obsessed nobles. They serve out the sentences of their mortal twins, whether it be an infinity of torture or an eternity wandering the planes. Most never emerge from such trials, but some manage to find their own paths upon the planes.

Shabti typically look like idealized humans with perfect physiques and flawless features. They usually stand just over 6 feet tall and weigh between 150 and 210 pounds.

Shabti Racial Traits

+2 Constitution, +2 Charisma: Shabti have powerful bodies and presences to match.

Native Outsider: Shabti are outsiders with the native subtype.

Medium: Shabti are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Darkvision: Shabti can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Immortal (Ex): Shabti do not age naturally and can't die of old age. While some might come into being at age categories other than adulthood, they never leave their original age categories. Spells and effects that cause aging affect a shabti as normal.

Immune to Undeath (Ex): Shabti can't become undead. Spells and abilities that would transform a shabti into an undead creature have no effect.

Past Life Knowledge (Ex): Shabti remember bits of their past lives. As a result, they treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.

Resist Level Drain (Ex): A shabti takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though it can still be killed if it accrues more negative levels than it has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a shabti takes are automatically removed without the need for additional saving throws.

Shattered Soul (Ex): Shabti who are killed are exceptionally difficult to return to life. Anyone who attempts to return a shabti to life using <a href="spelldisplay0d07.html?ItemName=raise%20dead">raise dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayd65d.html?ItemName=resurrection">resurrection</a>, or a similar spell must succeed at a caster level check whose DC is equal to 10 + the shabti's Hit Dice. If it fails, the spell fails and the caster can't return the shabti to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period).

Normal Speed: Shabti have a base speed of 30 feet.

Spell-Like Ability: A shabti can use <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to the shabti's class level.

Languages: Shabti begin play speaking Common. Those with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).

Shabti Alternate Racial Traits



Replaces Immune to Undeath, Native Subtype

A few shabti are made with such skill they are nearly perfect copies of a mortal. Shabti with this racial trait appear to be human, save perhaps for minor features like unusual skin color. They count as humanoid (human) as well as outsider (native) for all purposes (such as humanoid-affecting spells like <a href="spelldisplay0d65.html?ItemName=charm%20person">charm person</a>).

This racial trait replaces immune to undeath and alters the native subtype.


Replaces Past Life Knowledge

Blank Slate

Some shabti are bereft of memories of their past lives but can accomplish great improvisations. Shabti with this racial trait can, once per day as a free action, treat any skill as though they had a number of ranks equal to half of their character levels for one skill check (minimum 1 rank).

This racial trait replaces past life knowledge.


Replaces Resist Level Drain

Soul Sympathy

Crafted to suffer punishments intended for their masters, some shabti can use this mortal connection to serve as reciprocal conduits. As an immediate action after being afflicted by temporary negative levels, a shabti with this racial trait can force the creature that inflicted the negative levels to suffer the same cumulative penalties, hit point loss, and caster level reduction. The shabti can use this ability only on an enemy within 60 feet and can share penalties with only one creature at a time. The shabti can sever this link as a free action.

This racial trait replaces resist level drain.


Replaces Spell-Like Ability

Pharaonic Will

Rather than working to influence others, some shabti focus inward. Once per day as an immediate action after failing a save against a charm, compulsion, or fear effect, a shabti with this racial trait can reroll the save with a +2 racial bonus.

This racial trait replaces spell-like ability.


Shabti Favored Class Options
