The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to fey creatures, though with key differences. While fey are truly linked to the flora and fauna of their homes, existing as the nearly immortal voices and guardians of the wilderness, elves are instead mortals who are in tune with the natural world around them. Elves seek to live in balance with the wild and understand it better than most other mortals. Some of this understanding is mystical, but an equal part comes from the elves' long lifespans, which in turn gives them long-ranging outlooks. Elves can expect to remain active in the same locale for centuries. By necessity, they must learn to maintain sustainable lifestyles, and this is most easily done when they work with nature, rather than attempting to bend it to their will. ??

However, their links to nature are not entirely driven by pragmatism. Elves' bodies slowly change over time, taking on a physical representation of their mental and spiritual states, and those who dwell in a region for a long period of time find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on coloration that reflects the local environment. ??

Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is accepted as a comrade, the resulting alliances can last for generations. Elves take great joy in forging alliances with races that share or exceed their long lifetimes, and often work to befriend dragons, outsiders, and fey. Those elves who spend their lives among the short-lived races, on the other hand, often develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of companions age and die before their eyes. ??

Physical Description: Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves as a whole varies wildly, and is much more diverse than that of human populations. However, as their coloration often matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones. ??

While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves who live in cities tend to bedeck themselves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling elves encounter other urbanites, the elves are often fashion trendsetters. ??

Society: Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Although, like most, elves prefer bountiful lands where resources are plentiful, when driven to live in harsher climates, they work hard to protect and shepherd the region's bounty, and learn how to maximize the benefit they receive from what little can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take pride as a society in the accomplishment. While this can make them excellent guides to outsiders they befriend who must travel through such lands, their disdain of those who have not learned to live off the scant land as they have makes such friends rare. ??

Elves have an innate gift for craftsmanship and artistry, especially when working in wood, bone, ivory, or leather. Most, however, find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful, and prefer to avoid forging, stonework, and pottery. When such work must be done within a community, a few elves may find themselves drawn to it, but regardless of their craftsmanship, such "dirt-wrights" are generally seen by other elves as being a bit off. In the most insular of elven societies, they may even be treated as lower class. ??

Elves also have an appreciation for the written word, magic, and painstaking research. Their naturally keen minds and senses, combined with their inborn patience, make them particularly suited to wizardry. Arcane research and accomplishment are seen as both practical goals, in line with being a soldier or architect, and artistic endeavors as great as poetry or sculpture. Within elven society, wizards are held in extremely high regard as masters of an art both powerful and aesthetically valued. Other spellcasters are not disdained, but do not gain the praise lavished upon elven wizards. ??

Relations: Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another race, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing the race as a whole. If called on this behavior, the elf often doesn't understand why his "special friend" is upset the elf has noticed the friend is "so much better than the rest of his kind." Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking. ??

Elves are not foolish enough, however, to dismiss all aspects of other races and cultures. An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge dwarves' skill at smithing and their tenacity in facing orc threats. Elves regard gnomes as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, but regard their magical talent as being worthy of praise and respect. Halflings are often viewed with a measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, who seem to live in a few short years as full a life as an elf manages in centuries. In fact, many elves become infatuated with humans, as evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world. Elves have difficulty accepting crossbreeds of any sort, however, and usually disown such offspring. They similarly regard half-orcs with distrust and suspicion, assuming they possess the worst aspects of orc and human personalities. ??

Alignment and Religion: Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic good, wishing all creatures to be safe and happy, but unwilling to sacrifice personal freedom or choice to accomplish such goals. serving as an example of personal artistry and freedom of expressions, rather than seeking some base physical gratification. ??

Adventurers: Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded realms to reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their ancestors. This need to see a wider world is accepted by their societies as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced individuals. Such elves are expected to return in some few decades and take up lives in their homelands once more, enriched both in treasure and in worldview. For those elves raised among humans, however, life within their homes-watching friends and family swiftly age and die-is often stifling, and the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds a natural appeal. ??

Elves generally eschew melee because of their relative frailty, preferring instead to engage enemies at range. Most see combat as unpleasant even when needful, and prefer it be done as quickly as possible, preferably without getting close enough to smell their foes. This preference for making war at a distance, coupled with their natural accuracy and grasp of the arcane, encourages elves to pursue classes such as wizards and rangers. ??

Male Names: Caladrel, Heldalel, Lanliss, Meirdrarel, Seldlon, Talathel, Variel, Zordlon. ??

Female Names: Amrunelara, Dardlara, Faunra, Jathal, Merisiel, Oparal, Soumral, Tessara, Yalandlara.

Subraces



Aquatic Elves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 10</a>
Aquatic elves are the oceanic cousins of landborn elves. These elves have developed gills and webbed fingers and toes that allow them to survive and navigate the waters of Golarion, and often have blue, coral, or seaweed-black skin to blend into their environment. A significant number of aquatic elves live in the Steaming Sea near Mordant Spire, and in the Arcadian Ocean. Aquatic elves typically live secluded lives, either on their own or in small communities, though groups of aquatic elves that interact with land-dwelling communities are not uncommon. These elves are as varied as their land-dwelling kin, with unique cultures and customs scattered throughout the oceans and seas of Golarion. Aquatic elves often have the aquatic mastery alternate racial trait described below.



Arctic Elf

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 23</a>
These elves were born and raised in the frozen lands of the far north or south, and have dealt with freezing deserts, nights that last for weeks, and the horrors that roam the cold terrain. These elves have the darkvision, desert runner, and elemental resistance alternate racial traits.



Dusk Elf

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 23</a>
Rather than being tied to the terrain around them, some elves are linked to the night itself. Though not tied to demon worship and evil as drow are, these elves are similarly attuned to the magical concepts of darkness and shadow. These elves have the arcane focus, darkvision, dreamspeaker, and silent hunter alternate racial traits.



Ekujae Elves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 10</a>
Though the Ekujae clans are often mistaken for unaffiliated tribes, they are in fact a united nation and still hold vestiges of the power that their ancient kingdom once wielded. Ekujae elves reside within the Mwangi Expanse in hidden jungle villages so interwoven with the surrounding trees that the buildings there are overlooked even by travelers passing within a few hundred feet them. Unlike many of the elves of Avistan, the Ekujae remained on Golarion despite the calamity of Earthfall and tell tales of having defeated a "Great Darkness" after the disaster. They still hone their skills for war and are ever ready to fight the Darkness if it returns. Due to this ancient responsibility, Ekujae hold to strict traditions in many matters, including the burying of their fallen and the act of swearing oaths and ritualized agreements.

Like other elves, Ekujae have keen intellects and are skilled in magical lore, including what has been passed down through their oral traditions and the numerous secrets of the Mwangi Expanse. They often journey to the Magaambya to study magic or to share their knowledge with that academy's students. Ekujae frequently have the long-limbed alternate racial trait and either the woodcraft, silent hunter, or light against darkness alternate racial traits, as well as the sense thoughts alternate racial trait described below.



Forlorn Elves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 11</a>
Forlorn elves rarely refer to themselves by that name; instead, other elves use the term to refer to elves who reside among shorter-lived races. Forlorn elves often watch many of their friends and family die before their first century is past. Some Forlorn have adopted a variety of unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result, such as recklessness or substance abuse; others develop antisocial tendencies and keep others at arm's length to avoid the pain of loss. Still others learn to accept the brevity of the lives around them, cherishing what time they have with friends while they still have it.

Forlorn are the most common wanderers of elvenkind, whether they're traveling widely to avoid attachment or relishing travel with short-lived companions, and many become adventurers. Some find their way to elven lands, where their kin sympathetically welcome them, while others avoid such places out of bitterness or fear of rejection. Forlorn elves frequently have the envoy and urbanite alternate racial traits; some also have the devoted companion alternate racial trait described below.



Jininese Elves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 11</a>
The elves of Jinin are descended from those who traveled underground millennia ago to escape Earthfall. Led by the oracle Jininsiel and guided by a vast, treelike vein of mithral, these elves emerged in Tian Xia, where they founded the nation of Jinin. Jininese elves have adopted many of the customs of their human and samsaran neighbors-Jinin's culture places great emphasis on artistic pursuits, especially those involving mithral, which serves as a national symbol, lucrative export, and treasured cultural relic for Jininese elves. The elves of Jinin are far less isolationist than many other elven cultures, freely permitting outsiders into Jinin; likewise, while most Jininese elves remain there, many travel or settle across the Dragon Empires and beyond.

Jininese elves frequently have the dreamspeaker and envoy alternate racial traits, as well as the Jininese weapon mastery alternate racial trait described below.



Savage Elf

In lands where every day is a constant struggle to survive and the niceties of civilization are rare, elves adapt to depend on swift strikes and lifelong vigilance to keep their families alive. These elves have the eternal grudge and fleet-footed alternate racial traits.



Snowcaster Elves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 11</a>
The Snowcaster tribes of the far north are extraordinarily reclusive, hiding their settlements in icy caverns, mountain valleys, the hearts of snow-shrouded pine forests, and other difficult-to-reach places. Their loyalty to their homes borders on religious reverence, whether they are ancestral burial grounds, ancient elven ruins, or simply places they've chosen as their own. Snowcasters rarely journey outside their homes or meet with outsiders. The primary exceptions to this are the twilight speakers, who serve as emissaries to the outside world. Less commonly, Snowcasters who have been exiled, who have lost their homes to monsters, or who are simply overcome with wanderlust may journey to the outside world to seek a new life.

Snowcasters frequently have the desert runner, elemental resistance (cold), and fleet-footed alternate racial traits; a few have the frostmelding alternate racial trait described below.



Spiresworn Elves

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 11</a>
The Mordant Spire's elves, with their eerie masks and off-putting mannerisms, are a mystery to most Avistani. These elves have sworn to prevent exploration of Azlant in order to preserve and isolate the remnants of the Azlanti culture and protect Golarion from another Earthfall. The reclusive Spiresworn use enchantment and water magic to dissuade explorers; they resort to violent or deadly means only with utmost reluctance. In recent years, some younger Spiresworn have begun to question their isolationist traditions. While their commitment to protecting Azlant remains firm, a growing segment of Spiresworn believe that there is much to gain from interaction with the wider world. These elves sometimes leave the Spire to seek knowledge and experience.

Spiresworn frequently have the keeper of secrets alternate racial trait, as well as the crossbow training, natural swimmer, and tongue of the sea alternate racial traits; some also have the moonkissed alternate racial trait described below.



Tower Elf

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 23</a>
Some elven institutions of magical learning date back centuries, and entire clans of elves have lived for generations as caretakers, students, and instructors of these self-sufficient schools of wizardry. These elves have the arcane focus and urbanite alternate racial traits.
