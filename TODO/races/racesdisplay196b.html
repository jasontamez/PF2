Aquatic elves can live either in or out of the water, but most prefer homes in the watery depths of oceans and seas. They establish small communities, uniting with other aquatic elves as needed for protection but remaining largely independent. Some of these communities are built partly above and partly below the water, with half-elves of aquatic descent living in the open air, while their aquatic kin make their homes below. An example of such a settlement is Acisazi, off the coast of the Chelish archduchy of Ravounel.

Aquatic elves consider themselves an enlightened people capable of appreciating life in more dimensions than other creatures. When they do interact with other races, they often appear aloof and dismissive, as though bored or distracted, though this is not necessarily the case. Aquatic elves are simply thinking of what wonders they might find during their explorations of their watery environs.

Aquatic elves living in the Arcadian Ocean maintain cordial relations with the elves of the Mordant Spire-the guardians of the ruins of ancient Azlant. Mordant Spire elves trust their aquatic kin to explore the ruins and recover valuable historical artifacts while leaving the dangerous ones undisturbed. These elves take pride in the faith placed in them, and to maintain good relations with their surface cousins, they refuse to share their knowledge of the Azlanti ruins with others.

Considered beautiful by many elves, humans, and similar surface races, aquatic elves are a graceful and quick-witted people. Their skin can be the pale white or gold of beach sand, the russet of living coral, or the greenblack of deepwater kelp. Often, aquatic elves' coloration adjusts to their usual environment over time, sometimes changing over the course of a few generations. Their hair is long and silky, rippling with shades of blue and green. Aquatic elves have delicate, translucent webbing between their fingers and toes, allowing them to swim adroitly through the water.

Adventurers: Groups of aquatic elves are known to specialize in searching ruins for pieces of art, historical records, and magical artifacts from sunken and forgotten empires. Those exploring the submerged debris of long-lost cities sometimes partner with adventurers of other races to overcome dangerous traps or guardians. Prideful as they are, aquatic elves know that other creatures can contribute specialized abilities to an expedition, though they are happiest working with gnomes, halflings, and surface elves, as these creatures are likely to return to the surface when their business beneath the waves is done. Some aquatic elves distrust humans, who they believe conceal expansionist motives and have a reckless disregard for danger- especially as concerns ancient and dangerous magic. Aquatic elves ally with gillmen only when necessary, as they worry that any such collaboration could be a part of some deeper aboleth scheme.

Aquatic elves believe that life is more vivid underwater than on land and that exceptional possibilities-both material and spiritual-exist for aquatic explorers. Aquatic elf adventurers, particularly those with no obligations to family or community, seek out hidden caverns, new species of plants or animals, and undiscovered ruins in the deepest reaches of the ocean, believing that their journeys lead to personal spiritual evolution.

As with surface elves, aquatic elves often have an aptitude for arcane magic, and the lure of lost power can draw aquatic elf adventurers far from familiar environments. Arcane practitioners venture into submerged abandoned sites associated with other races, such as cecaelias or merfolk, hunting for lost magic items or forgotten spells; these expeditions often bring the aquatic elves into conflict with the races that consider the ruins their own. Aquatic elf adventurers may even leave the ocean and travel on dry land to pursue rumors of particularly powerful treasures, no matter how thinly substantiated. When they do so, they prefer to ally with surfacers who know the area well (or hire one or more guides or specialists), as they harbor an unnatural fear of getting lost while on land and being unable to return to their vibrant ocean homes, even though they suffer no physical detriments from being on land for extended periods of time.

Aquatic Elf Favored Class Options

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, Aquatic Elves have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.

The following options are available to all Aquatic Elves who have the listed favored class.

Arcanist (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qjp?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Sea">Blood of the Sea pg. 5</a>): Add 1/4 to the arcanist's caster level when casting spells with the water descriptor.
Cavalier (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qjp?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Sea">Blood of the Sea pg. 5</a>): Add 1 skill rank to the cavalier's mount. If the cavalier ever replaces his mount, the new mount gains these bonus skill ranks.
Druid (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qjp?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Sea">Blood of the Sea pg. 5</a>): Add 1 hit point to the druid's animal companion. If the druid ever replaces her animal companion, the new animal companion gains these bonus hit points. For a druid whose nature bond gives her a cleric domain, select one cleric domain power at 1st level that is normally usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the druid's Wisdom modifier. The druid adds 1/2 to the number of uses per day of that domain power.
