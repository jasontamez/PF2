Monster Entry <a href="monsterdisplayd0bd.html?ItemName=Oread">Link</a>
Oreads are humans whose ancestry includes the touch of an elemental being of earth somewhere along the line, often that of a shaitan genie. Stoic and contemplative, oreads are a race not easily moved, yet almost unstoppable when spurred to action. They remain a mystery to most of the world thanks to their reclusive nature, but those who seek them out in their secluded mountain hideaways find oreads to be quiet, dependable, and protective of their friends.

Physical Description: Oreads are strong and solidly built, with skin and hair colored stony shades of black, brown, gray, or white. While all oreads appear vaguely earthy, a few bear more pronounced signs of their elemental heritage-skin that shines like polished onyx, rocky outcroppings protruding from their flesh, glowing gemstones for eyes, or hair like crystalline spikes. They often dress in earthy tones, wearing practical clothing well suited to vigorous physical activity and preferring fresh flowers, simple gemstones, and other natural accents to complex manufactured jewelry.

Society: As a minor offshoot of the human race, oreads have no real established society of their own. Instead, most oreads grow up in human communities learning the customs of their parents. Adult oreads have a well-deserved reputation among other races for being hermits and loners. Few take well to the bustle of city life, preferring instead to spend their days in quiet contemplation atop some remote mountain peak or deep below the earth in a secluded cavern. Oreads with a greater tolerance for life among humans often join the city watch, or find some other way to serve their community in a position of responsibility.

Relations: Oreads feel comfortable in the company of dwarves, with whom they have much in common. They find gnomes too strange and many halflings far too brash, and so avoid these races in general. Oreads gladly associate with half-orcs and half-elves, feeling a sense of kinship with the other part-human races despite inevitable personality conflicts. Among the elemental-touched races, oreads have few friends but no true enemies.

Alignment and Religion: Oreads are, perhaps above all else, set in their ways, and any disruption of their routine is met with quiet disapproval. Oreads are fiercely protective of their friends, but don't seem particularly concerned with the well-being of those outside their small circle of acquaintances. As such, most oreads are lawful neutral. Religious life comes easily to the earth-touched. They appreciate the quiet, contemplative life of the monastic order, and most dedicate themselves to the worship of earth- or nature-related deities.

Adventurers: Oreads are initially hesitant adventurers. They dislike leaving their homes and don't handle the shock of new experiences well. Usually it takes some outside force to rouse oreads into action, often by threatening their homes, lives, or friends. Once the initial threat is dealt with, however, oreads often find they've grown accustomed to the adventuring life, and continue to pursue it through the rest of their days. Oreads make good monks and fighters thanks to their prodigious strength and self-discipline.

Male Names: Andanan, Jeydavu, Mentys, Oret, Sithundan, Urtar.

Female Names: Besthana, Echane, Ghatiyara, Irice, Nysene, Pashe.

Subraces



Gemsoul (Crystal Oread)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9z15?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-PlaneHopper-s-Handbook">Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 20</a>
With scintillating personalities to match their captivating appearances, gemsoul oreads command attention-and prefer it that way.

Typical Alignment N
Ability Modifiers +2 Str, +2 Cha, -2 Wis
Alternate Spell-Like Ability Gemsouls gain <a href="spelldisplayc403.html?ItemName=color%20spray">color spray</a> as a spell-like ability.
Crystal Affinity This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base oread's earth affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the deep earth bloodline and spellcasters with the Charm domain.

Gemsouls tend to have large egos and are flashy in their relationships. They gravitate towards artistic pursuits, most frequently of a performative nature, though they also have a strong tradition of symmetric poetry. Gemsouls prefer to make their homes in flamboyant societies or places where they can make meaningful personal contributions, as well as in nations that appreciate cultivated beauty, like Kyonin.

Gemsouls typically have dazzling, faceted skin, along with a cluster of crystalline formations instead of hair and pupil-less eyes of vivid colors. Some favor tattoos in complex, branching geometric shapes, and they can frequently be seen wearing silks or brightly dyed linen to contrast their complexions.



Ironsoul (Metal Oread)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9z15?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-PlaneHopper-s-Handbook">Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 20</a>
Stolid and indomitable, ironsoul oreads undertake great works, both physical and conceptual, with unwavering determination.

Typical Alignment LN
Ability Modifiers +2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Dex
Alternate Spell-Like Ability Ironsouls gain <a href="spelldisplay9438.html?ItemName=unerring%20weapon">unerring weapon</a> as a spell-like ability.
Metal Affinity This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base oread's earth affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the shaitan bloodline and spellcasters with the Metal subdomain.

Possessed of patience and a sense of self-refinement through struggle, ironsouls reflect their ancestry in their continuous and determined efforts towards self-improvement. Ironsouls are most at home in areas that reflect that same sense of directed and intentional growth, and they operate best within existing formal structures.

Ironsouls wear their elemental heritage on their skin, with most having some amount of metallic sheen. Their skin tone varies, with colors ranging from gold and silver to copper-green and dull, oxide gray.

Earth Insight
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 144</a>
Oread spellcasters sometimes find that their elemental heritage makes creatures of earth more willing to serve them. Summon monster and summon nature's ally spells that such oreads cast last 2 rounds longer than normal when used to summon creatures with the earth subtype. This racial trait replaces earth affinity.

Oread Gem Magic
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978p?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Elements">Blood of the Elements pg. 8</a>
The following alternate racial trait can be selected instead of an oread's default earth affinity racial trait. More information on alternate racial traits can be found on page 8 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.

Oreads' proclivity for long spans of study and concentration makes them natural wizards, witches, and oracles. Oreads with this racial trait can augment their earth-related spells and spell-like abilities through the use of precious and semiprecious gemstones as additional material components. The gems are destroyed in the process, granting the spell the listed effects in addition to its normal effects unless otherwise noted. Only one instance of oread gem magic can be applied to a spell at a time; excess expended gems do not stack.

Binding Earth: +1 damage; +1 to DC of Strength checks. Cost: Garnet worth 50 gp.

Binding Earth, Mass: As binding earth augmentation, affecting all targets of the augmented spell. Cost: Garnets worth 250 gp.

Calcific Touch: +1 Dexterity damage. Cost: Aquamarine worth 250 gp.

Clashing Rocks: +1 damage per damage die. Cost: Emeralds worth 1,500 gp.

Earthquake: +2 Reflex save DC in whatever application the spell is used; area increases to 100-foot-radius shapeable spread. Cost: Jet worth 500 gp.

Elemental Body: Duration increases to 10 minutes/level. Cost: Amber worth 250 gp for elemental body I, +100 gp per spell level for greater versions.

Magic Stone: Range increment increases by 10 feet. Cost: Moonstone worth 25 gp.

Meld into Stone: Can bring up to 200 pounds of equipment with you; you can see as normal out of the stone. Cost: Peridots worth 150 gp.

Mighty Fist of Earth: Increase unarmed strike damage by one step (to 1d4 in most instances). Cost: Sard or sardonyx worth 25 gp.

Raging Rubble: Rubble deals +1 damage; distraction DC increases by 1. Cost: Tourmaline worth 80 gp.

Shifting Sand: Move area of sands up to 15 feet as a move action. Cost: Turquoise worth 125 gp.

Soften Earth and Stone: Creatures can move only at a quarter their normal speed (minimum 5 feet) in areas of mud and loose dirt. Cost: Fluorite worth 100 gp.

Spike Stones: +1 piercing damage; spikes deal 1 point of bleed damage. Cost: Topaz worth 300 gp.

Stone Shape: Shapes that include moving parts have only 5% chance of not working. Cost: Opal worth 250 gp.

Stone Shield: If your opponent's attack strikes the stone shield, its full damage roll is also applied to its weapon. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks are not affected. Cost: Jade worth 75 gp.

Stoneskin: The cost of this spell's expensive material component can be reduced or increased to affect the spell's power accordingly. With reduced components, the spell grants DR 10/silver (instead of adamantine); with increased components, the spell absorbs 15 points of damage per caster level before it's discharged. Cost: Diamonds worth 150 gp (reduced); diamonds worth 500 gp (increased).

Stone in the Blood
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 145</a>
Oreads with this racial trait mimic the healing abilities of the mephits, gaining fast healing 2 for 1 round anytime they are subject to acid damage (the acid damage does not need to overcome the oread's resistances or immunities to activate this ability). The oread can heal up to 2 hit points per level per day with this ability, after which it ceases to function. This racial trait replaces earth affinity.


Replaces Energy Resistance

Granite Skin
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 144</a>
Rocky growths cover the skin of oreads with this racial trait. They gain a +1 racial bonus to natural armor. This racial trait replaces energy resistance.


Replaces Energy Resistance, Languages

Isolated
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 216</a>
Many oreads are loners and raise their families in isolated groups, either in deep caverns or high mountains. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks and Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks, and they can use Knowledge (dungeoneering) untrained. They begin play speaking only Terran, rather than Common and Terran. This racial trait replaces energy resistance and alters the oread's starting languages.


Replaces Languages, Subtype, Type

Mostly Human
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 215</a>
A few ifrits, oreads, sulis, sylphs, and undines have appearances much closer to those of their human ancestors; in fact, they may not even realize their true race. Such geniekin appear to be human, save perhaps minor features like unusual eye color, and they count as humanoid (human) as well as outsider (native) for all purposes (such as humanoid-affecting spells such as charm person or enlarge person). These geniekin do not automatically gain their associated elemental language (but may select it as a bonus language if their Intelligence is high enough). This ability alters the geniekin's type, subtype, and languages.


Replaces Spell-Like Ability

Ferrous Growth
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 144</a>
Oreads with this racial trait learn how to mimic the magic of their shaitan ancestors. Once per day, such an oread can cause a touched piece of nonmagical iron or steel to grow into an object up to 10 pounds in weight, such as a sword, crowbar, or light steel shield. This object remains in this form for 10 minutes or until broken or destroyed, at which point it shrinks back to its original size and shape. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Mountain-Born
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 144</a>
Oreads are drawn to mountains and other high places, and after many generations they've grown well suited to their environment. Oreads with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to cross narrow ledges and on saves against altitude fatigue and sickness. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Treacherous Earth
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 145</a>
Once per day, an oread with this racial trait can will the earth to rumble and shift, transforming a 10-foot-radius patch of earth, unworked stone, or sand into an area of difficult terrain, centered on an area the oread touches. This lasts for a number of minutes equal to the oread's level, after which the ground returns to normal. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.
