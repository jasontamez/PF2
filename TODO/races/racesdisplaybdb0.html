The wayangs are a race of small supernatural humanoids who trace their ancestry to the Plane of Shadows. They are extremely gaunt, with pixielike stature and skin the color of deep shadow. Deeply spiritual, they follow a philosophy known as "The Dissolution," which teaches that in passing they may again merge into the shadow. They readily express their beliefs through ritual scarification and skin bleaching, marking their bodies with raised white dots in ornate spirals and geometric patterns. Shy and elusive, they live in small, interdependent tribes. Wayangs rarely associate with outsiders.

Wayang Alternate Racial Traits



Replaces Light and Dark, Lurker, Shadow Resistance

Poison Minion
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 5</a>
Drow sometimes augment their slaves and frontline warriors by making them toxic, causing their bodies to internally produce mawbane poison (see below). The resulting poisonous creature makes a potent weapon in the effort to discourage neighboring monsters. Any creature that hits such a character with a bite attack is immediately exposed to its poison. The save DC for this poison is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's Hit Dice + the character's Constitution modifier.

Mawbane Poison-ingested; save Fortitude as above; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Constitution damage; cure 1 save.

Dwarves can take this trait in place of defensive training and hardy. Elves can take this trait in place of elven magic and weapon familiarity. Gnomes can take this trait in place of defensive training, gnome magic, and illusion resistance. Half-elves can take this trait in place of elven immunities and keen senses. Half-orcs can take this trait in place of orc ferocity and weapon familiarity. Humans can take this trait in place of skilled. Halfling physiology prevents them from taking this trait. Drow can take this trait in place of drow immunities, light blindness, spell resistance, and weapon familiarity. Wayangs can take this trait in place of light and dark, lurker, and shadow resistance.


Replaces Light and Dark, Shadow Resistance

Scion of Shadows
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 10</a>
Some wayangs retain an uncommonly powerful connection to the Plane of Shadow. A wayang with this racial trait counts as an outsider (native) and a humanoid (wayang) for any effect related to race, including feat prerequisites and spells that affect humanoids. In addition, attacks made against such a wayang in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of the normal 20% miss chance. This ability doesn't grant total concealment; it only increases the miss chance. This racial trait replaces light and dark and shadow resistance.


Replaces Lurker

In the Shadows
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 217</a>
Many wayangs perform a variety of unusual roles and tasks in wayang society. They gain a +2 racial bonus on their choice of two of the following skills: Appraise, Bluff, Craft, Profession, and Sleight of Hand. This racial trait replaces lurker.


Replaces Shadow Magic

Dissolution's Child
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 210</a>
Once per day, you may change your appearance to look as if you were little more than a 4-foot-tall area of shadow. Your physical form still exists and you are not incorporeal-only your appearance changes. This works like invisibility, except it only lasts 1 round per level (maximum 5 rounds). This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces shadow magic.

Shadow Inheritor (Su)
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 10</a>
Wayangs with exceptional ties to their shadowy heritage have great skill at manipulating shadows. A wayang with this trait treats his caster level as being 1 higher for all level-based calculations of illusion spells he casts with the darkness or shadow descriptor, powers of the Darkness domain, bloodline powers of the shadow bloodline, and revelations of the oracle's shadow mystery (see page 12). This trait doesn't give wayangs early access to level-based powers; it affects their effective level only for powers they could already use without this trait. This racial trait replaces shadow magic.

Shadow Speaker (Su)
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j6s?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Shadows">Blood of Shadows pg. 10</a>
Countless whispers of powerful beings from the Shadow Plane-long since dead or deeply dreaming-echo in the minds of wayangs with strong spiritual connections to the darkness. These faint voices hint at revelations of things to come and suggest actions for receptive listeners to undertake. Three times per day as a free action, but no more than once per turn, a wayang with this racial trait can heed these uncanny whispers to gain a +2 insight bonus on an ability check, attack roll, caster level check, concentration check, saving throw, or skill check. The wayang must choose to use this ability before making the appropriate die roll. This racial trait replaces shadow magic.
