Mysterious humanoids with pale blue flesh and transparent blood like the waters of a trickling brook, samsarans are ancient creatures even in their youth. A samsaran's life is not a linear progression from birth to death, but rather a circle of birth to death to rebirth. Whenever a samsaran dies, it reincarnates anew as a young samsaran to live a new life. Her past memories remain vague and indistinct-and each new incarnation is as different a creature and personality as a child is to a parent.

Samsarans appear similar to humans, with dark hair and solid white eyes with no pupils or irises. Skin tones are generally shades of light blue.

Samsaran Racial Traits

+2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, -2 Constitution: Samsarans are insightful and strong-minded, but with frail bodies.
Samsaran: Samsarans are humanoids with the samsaran subtype.
Medium: Samsarans are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

Samsaran Magic: Samsarans with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day- <a href="spelldisplayf5cf.html?ItemName=Comprehend%20Languages">comprehend languages</a>, <a href="spelldisplay35be.html?ItemName=Deathwatch">deathwatch</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayc7b0.html?ItemName=Stabilize">stabilize</a>. The caster level for these effects equals the samsaran's character level.
Shards of the Past: A samsaran's past lives grant her bonuses on two skills. The samsaran chooses two skills-she gains a +2 racial bonus on both, and they are always class skills for her. Once made, this choice can't be altered.
Languages: Samsarans begin play speaking Common and Samsaran. Samsarans with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: any human language, Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Draconic, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, Nagaji, Tengu, and Terran.

Samsarans, often from Zi Ha, who live their lives in the mountains are immune to altitude sickness and do not lose their Dexterity bonus to AC when making Climb checks or Acrobatics checks to cross narrow or slippery surfaces. This racial trait replaces lifebound.

You can add spells from another spellcasting class to the spell list of your current spellcasting class. You add a number of spells equal to 1 + your spellcasting class's key ability score bonus (Wisdom for clerics, and so on). The spells must be the same type (arcane or divine) as the spellcasting class you're adding them to. For example, you could add divine power to your druid class spell list, but not to your wizard class spell list because divine power is a divine spell. These spells do not have to be spells you can cast as a 1st-level character. The number of spells granted by this ability is set at 1st level. Changes to your ability score do not change the number of spells gained. This racial trait replaces shards of the past.


Samsaran Favored Class Options

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, Samsarans have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.

The following options are available to all Samsarans who have the listed favored class.

Monk (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 198</a>): Add a +1/2 bonus on the monk's saving throws to resist death attacks.
Oracle (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 198</a>): Add one spell known from the oracle spell list. This spell must be at least one level below the highest spell level the oracle can cast.
Rogue (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 198</a>): The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.
