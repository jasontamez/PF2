Cleave (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 119</a>
You can strike two adjacent foes with a single swing.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a single attack at your full base attack bonus against a foe within reach. If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus) against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn.

When using the Cleave or Great Cleave feat, you can spend 4 stamina points to negate the -2 penalty to Armor Class until your next turn.

Mythic Cleave

You can cleave any foe within your reach.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2107.html?ItemName=Cleave">Cleave.</a>

Benefit:  Whenever you use Cleave or Great Cleave, one of your attacks can be made against a foe that is within your reach, but not adjacent to the foe you attacked. You can expend one use of mythic power when you use Cleave or Great Cleave to continue making attacks against foes within your reach, regardless of their position, as long as you continue to hit each foe. You can't use this ability to attack a foe more than once per round.
