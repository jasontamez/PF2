Savage technologists exhort Kellids to rise up against the depredations of the Technic League. But rather than rejecting technology, they wield the League's own weapons against it. A savage technologist has the following class features.

Class skills:  Acrobatics (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive Wis), Ride (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  A savage technologist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, all firearms, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Rage (Ex):  A savage technologist can enter rage as a barbarian, except she gains a morale bonus to Strength and Dexterity instead of Strength and Constitution, and she does not take a penalty to Armor Class. She retains the bonus on Will saving throws. When a barbarian ability would increase the savage technologist's Strength while raging, it increases her Dexterity instead. This ability alters rage.

Sword and Gun (Ex):  At 2nd level, when a raging savage technologist wields a one-handed firearm in one hand and a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other, she can make ranged attacks with the firearm without provoking attacks of opportunity. She also gains the benefits of the <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat, but only if all attacks are made with those weapons. This ability replaces Uncanny Dodge.

Primal Magnetism (Ex):  At 3rd level, a savage technologist adds her Strength modifier on Diplomacy checks when interacting with tribal cultures. She can expend 2 rounds of rage (even if not raging) to add a bonus equal to 1/2 his barbarian level on a Diplomacy check.

Crack Shot (Ex):  At 5th level, a savage technologist adds her Dexterity modifier to her damage rolls when making ranged attacks with a firearm while raging. This ability replaces Improved Uncanny Dodge.
