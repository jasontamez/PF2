Impaling Charge

Your charge impales opponents on your deadly horns.

Prerequisites: Gore attack, powerful charge.

Benefit: When you hit an opponent with a gore attack as part of a charge, you might also start a grapple as a free action. You do not need to make an additional touch attack to start this grapple and you do not provoke an attack of opportunity. Do not add your size modifier (if positive) to the initial grapple check made to start the grapple. Your size modifier applies as normal on all subsequent checks.
