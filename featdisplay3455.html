You've trained at swimming in combat and over long distances for so long that you can move through the water like a native.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Swim)</a>, Swim 10 ranks.

Benefit: You gain a swim speed of 30 feet or your unmodified base land speed, whichever is slower; your racial bonus on Swim checks for having a swim speed is +2, instead of +8.
