When making an attack using this feat, you can spend a number of stamina points up to the number of dice in your channel energy. For each stamina point you spend in this way, add an additional 1d6 points of positive or negative energy damage to your Channel Smite attack. This damage is also halved if the target succeeds at its Will save against the Channel Smite attack.
