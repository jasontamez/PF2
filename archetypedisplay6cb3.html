As part of studying the secret methods the original Jistkan artificers used to build golems, these magi graft construct parts onto their own arms.

Diminished Spellcasting: A Jistkan artificer has one fewer spell slot of each level than a regular magus. If this reduces his number of spell slots of a particular level to zero, he can cast spells of that level only if his Intelligence allows bonus spells of that level.

This alters the magus's spellcasting.

Golem Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer begins play with a golem arm grafted in place of one of his arms. The golem arm is a masterwork weapon that is treated as an unarmed strike and deals damage as if he were a monk 2 levels lower than his class level (minimum 1st level). The golem arm is made from basic parts and mundane materials that grant no additional benefits. A Jistkan artificer can recreate his golem arm from other materials by spending 1 day and paying an additional +50% of the normal cost of the special material used in the creation of this new golem arm. For the purposes of determining the weapon type and weight for special materials, the golem arm is treated as a heavy mace. If a Jistkan artificer recreates his golem arm, any previously used special materials are destroyed. The arm gains no benefits from items that enhance unarmed strikes, such as an amulet of mighty fists.

At 1st level, a Jistkan artificer can use his arcane pool to enhance his unarmed strikes as if they were manufactured weapons. At 5th level, he can use this ability to add any of the following special abilities to his unarmed strikes: corrosive, corrosive burst, defending, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, impact, shock, shocking burst, or thundering. At 11th level, he gains access to the following special abilities: brilliant energy and speed.

This alters arcane pool.

Improved Unarmed Strike: A Jistkan artificer gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. He prepares one fewer cantrip per day than normal.

This alters cantrips.

Empowered Arm (Ex): At 3rd level, a Jistkan artificer's golem arm is treated as a magic weapon and gains a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, to a total bonus of +5 at 19th level.

This replaces the magus arcana gained at 3rd level.

Unarmed Spellstrike (Su): A Jistkan artificer can use spellstrike to deliver spells only when attacking with his unarmed strikes.

This alters spellstrike.

Magus Arcana: A Jistkan artificer gains access to the following arcana in addition to those normally available to the magus. He cannot select any arcana more than once.

Break Spell (Ex): A Jistkan artificer can use his arm to disrupt spells targeted at him. When a ranged attack generated by a spell effect targets the Jistkan artificer, he can spend a point from his arcane pool to attempt a melee attack roll as an attack of opportunity. If the result is greater than the total attack roll of the ranged attack, the attack is negated. Spell effects that do not require attack rolls cannot be deflected. The magus must be at least 13th level and have the shielding arm arcana before selecting this arcana.

Flurrying Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer can improve his golem arm to attack faster. He gains the flurry of blows monk class ability, treating his class level as his monk level. A Jistkan artificer makes only one additional attack when he uses flurry of blows. The magus must be at least 11th level to select this arcana.

Sharpened Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer can rework his arm to more closely resemble a blade. He can choose to deal piercing or slashing damage with his golem arm. When he does so, the golem arm threatens a critical hit on 19-20. The artificer also adds keen and wounding to his list of arcane pool weapon abilities.

Shielding Arm (Ex): A Jistkan artificer learns to deflect blows with his arm. If he is not wielding any other weapons, he gains a shield bonus to his AC equal to his golem arm's enhancement bonus.
