Description

This +1 keen spear has a crimson haft made of petrified redwood, and its blackened stone head sports numerous vicious barbs on each side. Once per day when the wielder confirms a critical hit against a creature with this weapon, in addition to dealing damage, he can command the spear to turn the struck creature to stone. The creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or instantly become a mindless statue as flesh to stone. This effect traps the bloodstone impaler in the process, making it unusable as long as it remains embedded in the statue. A bloodstone impaler may be removed from a lapidified creature by a humanoid capable of wielding it who succeeds at a DC 25 Strength check; doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Removing a bloodstone impaler from a petrified victim instantly changes the creature back to its original form.
