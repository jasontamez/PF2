You can use your tail to help you maneuver more adroitly on the battlefield.

Prerequisites: Dragon creature type, tail attack.

Benefit: If you don't use your tail to make an attack, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD and on any combat maneuver checks you attempt until the beginning of your next turn.
