Description

The blade of this weapon, which is also called an injection spear, contains a thin tube or bore that connects to a hollow container just beneath the crosspiece. A successful hit with the spear injects the liquid contents of the container (typically poison or a potion) into the target. Refilling a syringe spear takes 1 minute.
