Description

This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that
can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions.
Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of
up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty,
and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused
for a decade.


A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of
the passage of as many as a dozen humanoids and horses to be
obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the
dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward
from this use of the dust. Survival checks made to track a quarry
across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than
normal.
