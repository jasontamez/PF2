Description

Sewn from deep purple fabric, an Anaphexis robe appears to be a plain version of Pharasmin holy vestments. A creature wearing this robe can speak directly into the minds of other creatures wearing Anaphexis robes or carrying an unholy symbol of Norgorber within 100 feet, as long as they share a common language. The robes grant a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a monk of Pharasma and a +10 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal weapons. Once per day, a wearer with the death attack class ability can reduce the number of rounds required to study a target for a death attack by 1.
