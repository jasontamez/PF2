Description

These travel-stained boots of stout brown leather enable
the wearer to traverse great distances without tiring. When
making a forced march (Core Rulebook 171), for each hour of
marching beyond 8 hours, the wearer needs only to make a
Constitution check (DC 10, +1 per extra hour) instead of the
normal check. Furthermore, if the wearer fails the check,
she only takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage and does not
becomes fatigued the first time she takes nonlethal damage
in this way.
