Description

This small sheath attaches to the wrist with a leather strap. The sheath can accommodate any single light weapon, wand, or piece of ammunition weighing no more than 5 pounds. While sheathed, the weapon is hidden in an extradimensional space and is weightless. As a swift action, the wearer can flex her wrist, ejecting the weapon into her hand. If her hand is not empty, the weapon remains sheathed. Stowing a weapon in the sheath requires a move action. The wearer gains a +4 bonus on any Sleight of Hand check to oppose the Perception check of someone observing or frisking the wearer in search of a weapon in the sheath.

Vanishing sheaths can be worn in pairs-one on each arm. A person wearing two vanishing sheaths can eject either or both weapons with a single swift action.
