Description

This bulky, key-wound, pocket-sized clock has three faces, each with its own hour hand. Each face can be wound and calibrated separately to account for up to three different time zones (for local use) or even different day lengths (for interstellar use). It is accurate to within half an hour per day and must be wound daily.
