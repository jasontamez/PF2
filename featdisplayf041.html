Your movement spells make allies swifter than normal.

Prerequisites: Dex 13+.

Benefit: You can alter spells that grant a creature a movement type it doesn't normally have to increase the speed for that movement type by 10 feet. A brisk spell uses a spell slot equal to the spell's normal spell level.
