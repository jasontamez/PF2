You can coax greater power out of
magical devices.


Prerequisites: Use Magic Device 12 ranks.

Benefit:  If you exceed the Use Magic
Device DC to activate a spell completion or
spell trigger item by 5 or more, you can increase the
item's caster level by 1 for determining the spell's effect.
Alternatively, if you exceed the Use Magic Device DC by
10 or more when activating a magic item with charges,
you can expend an additional charge to increase the
caster level by 2 levels. Regardless, you can't increase an
item's caster level to one that is higher than your own
caster level.
