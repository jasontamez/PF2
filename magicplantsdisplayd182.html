Description

The needles of this bitter, black herb grow in Numeria and are used to alleviate the effects of radiation poisoning. A creature that drinks tea made from the needles of cleanthistle is affected by a <a href="spelldisplay3bc2.html?ItemName=neutralize%20poison">neutralize poison</a> effect (CL 9th) except that the effect can neutralize only the oldest poison affecting the creature.

A cleanthistle stalk has a single 26-week growing period, through spring and summer. During this period, enough needles for a single dose of tea regrow 4 days after being harvested. The needles remain potent enough to brew for 1 week after being harvested.
