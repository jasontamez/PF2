<a href="monsterdisplayc5e1.html?ItemName=Lion%20Alebrije">Alebrijes</a> travel through dreams, visiting creatures as they sleep in hopes of answering questions, jogging memories, or providing inspiration. Alebrijes can take the shape of any animal or magical beast found throughout the Material Plane, though they have unique colorations and patterns all over their bodies, and some grow wings. These colorations typically include bright, vibrant hues and decorative patterns like spirals and stripes.

"Alebrije" is an acquired template that can be added to any animal or magical beast (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An alebrije uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR + 2.

Size: An alebrije with 8 Hit Dice or more increases in size by one category.

Type: The creature's type changes to magical beast (extraplanar). Do not recalculate its base attack bonus, saves, or skill ranks.

Senses: The creature gains darkvision with a range of 120 feet, dreamsight, and scent.

Dreamsight (Su): Alebrijes are able to notice and locate sleeping creatures within 500 feet, as well as creatures engaged in similar rest, such as meditation or resting trances.

Armor Class: Natural armor bonus increases by 2.

Hit Dice: Change all the creature's racial Hit Dice to d10s. Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.

Defensive Abilities: An alebrije with 5 Hit Dice or more gains DR 5/magic (or DR 10/magic if it has 11 Hit Dice or more) and SR equal to its new CR + 6 (or SR equal to its new CR + 11 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more). In addition, an alebrije gains cold resistance 5 and fire resistance 5 (or cold resistance 10 and fire resistance 10 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more).

Speed: An alebrije with 5 Hit Dice or more grows wings and gains a fly speed of 20 feet (average). If the alebrije has 11 Hit Dice or more, it gains a fly speed of 40 feet (average) instead. An alebrije that already has a fly speed improves its maneuverability by one step instead.

Melee: An alebrije's natural attacks grow mighty and fantastical. Increase the damage die of the base creature's primary natural attacks by one step. An alebrije's natural attacks are considered magical for the purposes of damage reduction.
