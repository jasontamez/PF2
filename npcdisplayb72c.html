One does not step lightly on the path to becoming a Hellknight. A Hellknight is not simply a disciplined warrior, nor is she just a strict supporter of a lawful society. A Hellknight is an instrument of unyielding, inevitable order. Every Hellknight knows that she and her fellows are the tools by which society will be broken and remade in accordance with the teachings of their code, which they call "The Measure and the Chain." By that code, all who live must be forced to obey the law. Only by imposing order can the Hellknights establish justice; only by overcoming the most difficult trials can a mortal be made worthy and able to impose that order.

A Hellknight armiger has chosen to subject herself to the Measure and to bear the Chain. She has not yet earned a rank or title from her chosen order and instead serves one or more Hellknights as a squire or banner bearer while she prepares herself to undertake the tests of knighthood. An armiger strives to emulate her betters by mastering the order's favored weapons'such as the glaive for those among the Order of the Pyre- and learning the Measure's seemingly endless list of infractions and violations and the required punishments for each.

An armiger also studies the lore of Hell of the infernal realms. This study serves two purposes. First, it allows her to understand and apply infernal law without mercy-valued because that infernal realm is an unf linching example of absolute order. Second, it prepares her to do battle with Hell's minions. These battles are required for admittance into the ranks of the Hellknights, but they continue throughout a knight's development, as her courage and strength are constantly tested to ensure that she remains worthy.

Hellknight armigers are most likely to be found in the lands and towns surrounding their order's citadel. Because they are not yet full Hellknights, they may not travel outside of the areas controlled by their order without permission. When they do travel with a contingent of Hellknights, it is usually as part of a test of discipline, loyalty, or courage. Those who fail are subjected to the same terrible punishments as any who break the law.
