Description

This kit for a heavy wagon provides a water tank, platform pump, and a rotating nozzle. If the operator succeeds at a DC 20 Strength check, the fire pump releases a stream of water that reaches up to 30 feet away. Each person assisting with the pump lowers the DC by 5. Operating or assisting is a full-round action. The pump extinguishes 5 square feet of nonmagical fire per round. The water tank holds enough water for 10 rounds of pumping and takes 10 minutes to refill from a stream, pond, lake, or other body of water.
