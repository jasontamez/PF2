You let your shield absorb some of the damage from a fall.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, base attack bonus +6 or fighter level 4th.

Benefit: When you fall 10 or more feet, you can direct half of the falling damage you would take to your shield. This damage ignores the shield's hardness.
