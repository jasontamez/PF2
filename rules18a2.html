As an alternative to altering the rules, you can do what fantasy authors do-establish magic as rare and remarkable, then portray the protagonists (the PCs) and their opponents as the few people who have access to it. In this model, you have high-magic PCs operating in a low-magic world. They retain ready access to magic items, but that doesn't mean that every wealthy or accomplished NPC they meet is likewise dripping with them. People gasp in awe when they see the heroes walk down the street. The open display of these items in public makes the PCs a target for thieves. Be careful not to overdo this last point, however; having rare items should make the players feel special, not hounded.

High-magic PCs in a low-magic world can't easily trade items and wouldn't dream of selling them. Use the wish list method of magic treasure allocation, described above, to ensure that players get the gear they need and want.
