You have a knack for placing yourself between your enemies and those they wish to harm.

Prerequisites: Con 17, <a href="featdisplay1698.html?ItemName=Toughness">Toughness.</a>

Benefit: During your action, designate an ally within your reach. When you fight defensively or use Combat Expertise, your ally gains a natural armor bonus to AC equal to the dodge bonus you gain from fighting defensively or Combat Expertise. You can select a new ally on any action. Allies who move out of your reach lose this natural armor bonus.
