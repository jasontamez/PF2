To make your own loci spirit like the examples below, follow these steps.

Step 1-Determine Base CR: A loci spirit's base CR is equal to 1 + the level of the spell it duplicates.

Step 2-Determine Actual CR: Select the elements you want the loci spirit to have and add up the adjustments to its CR to arrive at the loci spirit's final CR (see Table 6-1: CR Modifiers for Loci Spirits).

Step 3-Determine Caster Level: A loci spirit's caster level is equal to its CR.

Step 4-Determine Hit Points: A loci spirit's hit points are equal to twice its CR.

Step 5-Determine Ceremony DC: The ceremony check DC is equal to 20 + the loci spirit's CR.

Step 6'Save DCs: If a loci spirit's ceremonial effect allows a saving throw to resist or negate the effect, the save DC is equal to 10 + the level of the spell + the ability modifier of the minimum ability score needed to cast that level of spell. Normally, the ceremonial effect is harmless and thus applies only if a creature voluntarily wishes to resist or negate the effect.

Step 7-Determine Corruption Effect, Attack, and Save DCs: A corrupted loci spirit manifests a mind-affecting fear effect with the same spell level as its unique effect. A corrupted loci spirit's attack bonus (if needed) is usually equal to its CR.
