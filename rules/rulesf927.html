You might create a monster that should use the statistics for a character class, either because the monster would normally be created by adding class levels to the monster or because you think the monster's abilities are similar enough to those of a character class that it would be quicker to start with the class. In this case, look ahead to the <a href="rules5763.html?Name=Class%20Grafts&amp;Category=Step%202:%20Creature%20Type%20or%20Class%20Graft">class grafts</a> and use the array required by the class you desire. Keep in mind that a monster with class levels typically has a CR equal to its class level - 1, so if you want your monster to have particular level-dependent class abilities, you'll want to use the statistics for a CR that's 1 lower than the target class level.

As mentioned before, a monster that primarily relies on its racial or innate abilities with only a small number of class levels might be built differently. You can create the monster using its <a href="rules7ec1.html?Name=Creature%20Type%20Grafts&amp;Category=Step%202:%20Creature%20Type%20or%20Class%20Graft">creature type graft</a>, then refer to the related class graft for ideas of which monster options to select.
