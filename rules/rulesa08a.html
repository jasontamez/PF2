Teleportation effects have a big impact on your game because they can foil situations such as being tracked or followed, and can bypass protections, such as locks and walls. These kinds of effects often only enter the game during mid-level play.

<a href="spelldisplay84e4.html?ItemName=Dimension%20Door">Dimension Door</a>: <a href="spelldisplayb8a7.html?ItemName=Dimension%20door">Dimension door</a> works by specifying a distance within long range, and then the character and any passengers suddenly appear at that spot. This is useful for bypassing obstacles, which means that any vault-maker who plans to keep out characters with access to teleportation magic needs to consider this and plan accordingly. <a href="spelldisplay2c00.html?ItemName=Forbiddance">Forbiddance</a> is an excellent effect for hedging out teleportation effects such as <a href="spelldisplay0446.html?ItemName=dimension%20door">dimension door</a>, and tying a <a href="spelldisplaye3ec.html?ItemName=hallow">hallow</a> or <a href="spelldisplaydb22.html?ItemName=unhallow">unhallow</a> to <a href="spelldisplaybbc0.html?ItemName=dimensional%20anchor">dimensional anchor</a> also works well for this. Remember that the caster of the spell can take no further actions after arriving at their destination unless she has the <a href="featdisplay815b.html?ItemName=Dimensional%20Agility">Dimensional Agility</a> feat.

<a href="spelldisplay99e2.html?ItemName=Teleport">Teleport</a>: <a href="spelldisplay99e2.html?ItemName=Teleport">Teleport</a> is like <a href="spelldisplay0446.html?ItemName=dimension%20door">dimension door</a>, but adds considerably to the range and versatility. However, it is important to note that <a href="spelldisplaya488.html?ItemName=teleport">teleport</a> has several special limitations built into the spell. For one thing, the caster needs to know both the layout of the destination as well as where it is physically located. If the caster has managed to use divinations to see the layout of a secret hideout, it still won't do any good unless she knows where it is. Second, areas of strong physical and magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. Many GMs forget this important component, which actually gives the villain a good in-game reason to establish a secret volcano lair or build her fortress on a ley line. This advice applies equally well to <a href="spelldisplaydada.html?ItemName=teleport,%20greater">greater teleport</a>, although the results of a failed teleportation are less dire.
