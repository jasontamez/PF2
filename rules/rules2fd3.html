The character gains three legendary gifts at 19th level and five more at 20th level. (If you're using the variant with no magic treasure, characters gain seven more legendary gifts when their effective level reaches 21 and eight more when it reaches 22.) Select these legendary gifts from the following list.

Legendary Ability: Gain a +1 inherent bonus to any ability score. You can select this legendary gift multiple times, and it stacks up to +5 in any one ability score.

Legendary Armor: Your enhancement bonus from armor attunement increases by 2. If you are attuned to a suit of armor and a shield, you can either increase both bonuses by 1 or increase one bonus by 2. The enhancement bonus on a single attuned item can't exceed +5, but you can use the excess to add special abilities to the armor or shield (see <a href="rules429f.html?Name=Magic%20Weapons%20and%20Armor&amp;Category=Automatic%20Bonus%20Progression">Magic Weapons and Armor</a>. You can select this legendary gift multiple times; it stacks up to +10 on any one suit of armor or shield.

Legendary Body: Increase your bonuses from physical prowess to +6/+6/+4. This counts as two legendary gifts.

Legendary Body 2: Increase your bonuses from physical prowess to +6/+6/+6. You must already have legendary body to select this legendary gift.

Legendary Mind: Increase your bonuses from mental prowess to +6/+6/+4. This counts as two legendary gifts.

Legendary Mind 2: Increase your bonuses from mental prowess to +6/+6/+6. You must already have legendary mind to select this legendary gift.

Legendary Shieldmaster: Gain a +5 enhancement bonus from armor attunement for both your armor and your shield. You can select this legendary gift multiple times, choosing a different attuned suit of armor or shield each time.

Legendary Twin Weapons: Gain a +5 enhancement bonus from weapon attunement for two weapons at the same time. This counts as two legendary gifts. You can select this legendary gift multiple times, adding an additional attuned weapon with a +5 enhancement bonus each time.

Legendary Weapon: Your enhancement bonus from weapon attunement increases by 1. If you are attuned to more than one weapon, you can increase only one weapon's enhancement bonus in this way. The enhancement bonus on a single weapon can't exceed +5, but you can use the excess to add magic abilities to weapons (see <a href="rules429f.html?Name=Magic%20Weapons%20and%20Armor&amp;Category=Automatic%20Bonus%20Progression">Magic Weapons and Armor</a>, below). You can select this legendary gift multiple times, and it stacks up to +10 for any one weapon.
