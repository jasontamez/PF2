Conjuration spells fill a wide array of needs. This school of magic encompasses enhancement effects, teleportation effects, the conjuration of allies, and even the creation of permanent or temporary areas of terrain. Most of these spells really begin to show their usefulness at the middle levels of spellcasting.

<a href="spelldisplay35ba.html?ItemName=Heroes%e2%80%99%20Feast">Heroes' Feast</a>: Those partaking in a <a href="spelldisplay8706.html?ItemName=heroes%e2%80%99%20feast">heroes' feast</a> receive powerful bonuses in addition to the normal benefits of eating and drinking. The combination of <a href="spelldisplay3bc2.html?ItemName=neutralize%20poison">neutralize poison</a> and <a href="spelldisplay96a6.html?ItemName=remove%20disease">remove disease</a> in this spell is a particularly useful given the number of long-onset diseases and poisons in the wilderness. The spell does require a long casting time and consumption period to be effective; casting and consuming a <a href="spelldisplay8706.html?ItemName=heroes%e2%80%99%20feast">heroes' feast</a> takes at least 70 minutes. The flaws of this spell become apparent when the PCs ambush enemies partaking in this spell or are attacked while consuming their own feast.

<a href="spelldisplay47f5.html?ItemName=Transport%20via%20Plants">Transport via Plants</a> and <a href="spelldisplay8454.html?ItemName=Tree%20Stride">Tree Stride</a>: A dependable means of transportation within a forested environment, <a href="spelldisplaydc68.html?ItemName=tree%20stride">tree stride</a> combines the best of several spells, with temporary protection and stealth akin to <a href="spelldisplaya3a0.html?ItemName=meld%20into%20stone">meld into stone</a> or <a href="spelldisplayceba.html?ItemName=tree%20shape">tree shape</a>. It also offers a wide array of travel distance, with even coniferous trees allowing for transportation range in excess of <a href="spelldisplay0446.html?ItemName=dimension%20door">dimension door</a>, assuming a suitable tree is within range. <a href="spelldisplay8551.html?ItemName=Transport%20via%20plants">Transport via plants</a> is similar to an upgraded <a href="spelldisplaydc68.html?ItemName=tree%20stride">tree stride</a>, as it allows for theoretically limitless traveling distance on the same world, and it requires only a suitably sized plant with a matching species at the destination.

<a href="spelldisplay3354.html?ItemName=Wall%20of%20Stone">Wall of Stone</a> and <a href="spelldisplayb5f2.html?ItemName=Wall%20of%20Thorns">Wall of Thorns</a>: Both of these spells allow for the creation of walls to divide a battlefield. Walls made of stone have the benefit of adjoining to existing stone-a plentiful terrain feature in most wilderness environs. Since this spell has a duration of instantaneous, <a href="spelldisplayd7a5.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20stone">wall of stone</a> creates long-lasting defenses. Such walls can cut off tight-knit groups in confined areas, though creatures in the path of a forming wall can attempt a Reflex save to avoid entrapment. <a href="spelldisplay15ff.html?ItemName=Wall%20of%20thorns">Wall of thorns</a> creates a temporary effect, and while it doesn't block off terrain as dependably as <a href="spelldisplayd7a5.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20stone">wall of stone</a>, it covers twice the space of a stone wall and doesn't allow a Reflex save. <a href="spelldisplay15ff.html?ItemName=Wall%20of%20thorns">Wall of thorns</a> can be used to deadly effect when sculpted to cover larger area. These walls can be combined with area effects, such as <a href="spelldisplay23db.html?ItemName=cloudkill">cloudkill</a> or <a href="spelldisplayc71a.html?ItemName=insect%20plague">insect plague</a>, to devastate foes.
