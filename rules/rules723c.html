Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table 6-4).

Cost: This value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon, such as a scabbard or quiver. This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.

Dmg: These columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled -Dmg (S)- is for Small weapons. The column labeled -Dmg (M)- is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given, then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon's extra attack. Table 6-5 gives weapon damage values for Tiny and Large weapons.

Table 6-5: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage

<tr><td>Medium Weapon Damage</td><td>Tiny Weapon Damage</td><td>Large Weapon Damage</td></tr><tr><td>1d2</td><td>-</td><td>1d3</td></tr><tr><td>1d3</td><td>1</td><td>1d4</td></tr><tr><td>1d4</td><td>1d2</td><td>1d6</td></tr><tr><td>1d6</td><td>1d3</td><td>1d8</td></tr><tr><td>1d8</td><td>1d4</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>1d10</td><td>1d6</td><td>2d8</td></tr><tr><td>1d12</td><td>1d8</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><td>2d4</td><td>1d4</td><td>2d6</td></tr><tr><td>2d6</td><td>1d8</td><td>3d6</td></tr><tr><td>2d8</td><td>1d10</td><td>3d8</td></tr><tr><td>2d10</td><td>2d6</td><td>4d8</td></tr></table>

Critical: The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.

Extra damage over and above a weapon's normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.

??2: The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.

??3: The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.

??3/??4: One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

??4: The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.

19-20/??2: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit.

18-20/??2: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit.

Range: Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative -2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof ) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a -4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.

Weight: This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons. Some weapons have a special weight. See the weapon's description for details.

Type: Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.

Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; all damage caused is of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon.

In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.

Special: Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.

Brace: If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character (see Chapter 8).

Disarm: When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy.

Double: You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way-only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

Monk: A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows (see Chapter 3).

Nonlethal: These weapons deal nonlethal damage (see Chapter 8).

Reach: You use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.

Trip: You can use a trip weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.
