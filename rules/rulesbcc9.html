Arcane Flux: An experimental ritual performed by the Cabal has granted you additional power. Roll 1d4; you gain a bonus arcane spell slot of that spell level (as if from a high ability score, up to a maximum of the highest-level arcane spell slot you can cast) for 24 hours.

Discovery: A member of your Cabal has produced some unexpected results. Roll d%. On a result of 01-75, the Cabal creates 1d6 random 1st-level arcane scrolls (add +1 scroll if you have the <a href="featdisplay6b63.html?ItemName=Scribe%20Scroll">Scribe Scroll</a> feat). On a result of 76-100, the Cabal creates 1d3 random 1st-level arcane potions (add +1 potion if you have the <a href="featdisplay2e88.html?ItemName=Brew%20Potion">Brew Potion</a> feat). You may keep these potions or sell them for full value.

Familiar Scraps: Several familiars belonging to members of your Cabal are causing problems with each other or with local animals. You must succeed at a DC 25 Diplomacy, Handle Animal, or Knowledge (arcana) check, or spend 1d4 points of Goods and Influence (divided as you see fit) to calm things down.

Image Problem: An influential person, such as a conservative noble, leader of a rival organization, or professor at a local academy tries to discredit your organization. Attempt a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Knowledge (arcana) check opposed by this person's Bluff, Intimidate, or Knowledge (arcana) check (1d20 + 5 if the GM doesn't have a specific person in mind). If you succeed, you weather the bad comments and the event ends with no negative repercussions. If you succeed by at least 5, you increase your acclaim, gaining 1 point of Influence or Labor. If you fail, you lose 1d3 points of Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic (divided as you see fit) because of vandalism or members leaving out of fear.

Portent: A cabalist discovers an upcoming alignment of magical forces, increasing the cabal's productivity. For 1d3 days, the organization gains a +10 bonus on its first check each day to generate Goods, Influence, or Magic.

Work Opportunity: A noble, merchant, or other patron hires your Cabal to assist with magical preparations for a ritual or festival. For 1d6 days, the organization gains a +5 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day. If you rolled a 6 for the number of days, there's a 20% chance this causes a discovery event as described above.

Apostate: A member of your Cult leaves and badmouths you to outsiders. For 1d6 days, the organization takes a -5 penalty on checks to generate capital. If you rolled a 6 for the number of days, there's a 50% chance the end of this event causes an image problem event as described below. Silencing the apostate (through threats, violence, or bribes worth 1d6 points of Goods or Influence) ends this penalty early.

Blasphemy: Someone in your Cult has broken a serious taboo. All divine casters in the Cult treat their caster level as 1 lower than normal for 1d3 days.

Divine Flux: Treat this as an arcane flux event on the <a href="rules4635.html?Name=Cabel%20Events&amp;Category=Organization%20Events">Cabal Events</a> table (see page 127), except the bonus spell slot is divine instead of arcane.

Image Problem: An influential person, such as a conservative noble or leader of a rival church, attempts to discredit your organization. Attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check opposed by this person's Bluff or Intimidate check (1d20 + 5 if the GM doesn't have a specific person in mind). Success means you weather these attempts and the event ends with no negative repercussions. If you win by at least 5, you increase your fame, gaining your choice of 1 point of Influence or Labor. If you fail, you lose 1d3 points of Goods, Influence, and Labor (divided as you see fit) because of vandalism or members leaving out of fear.

Popular Ritual: One of your unusual customs, such as frequent use of hallucinogens or naked dancing, increases the Cult's popularity. For 1d8 days, the building gains a +5 bonus on its first check to generate Influence or Labor each day. If you rolled an 8 for the number of days, there's a 50% chance the end of this event causes an image problem event as described above.

Portent: One of your members has a vision or interprets something as a religious sign, increasing religious fervor among the other followers. Choose Goods, Influence, or Labor. For 2d6 days, the Cult gains a +5 bonus on its first check to generate that type of capital each day.

Schism: A popular member of your Cult tries to steal some of your people and create her own Cult. Attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Knowledge (religion) check against a DC equal to 20 + the number of teams in the organization. If you succeed, treat this as an apostate event as described above. If you fail by less than 5, you lose 1d2 points of Influence and 1d2 points of Labor. If you fail by 5 or more, you lose one team for every 5 full points by which you failed the DC. These lost teams go with the apostate.

Brawl: This functions like the <a href="rules2b57.html?Name=Tavern%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">bar brawl in Tavern Events</a>, except you may attempt a Profession (soldier) check instead of an Intimidate check, and a failed check causes a loss of Influence and Labor.

Duel: This functions like the <a href="rules2355.html?Name=Military%20Academy%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">duel event from the Military Academy Events section</a>, except you may attempt a Profession (soldier) check instead of a Diplomacy or Intimidate check.

Impressive Results: Your mercenaries perform admirably, eliminating a problem quickly or defeating a more powerful opponent with ease. You gain 1d4 points of Influence and 1d2 points of Labor, and for 1d6 days the organization gains a +10 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day.

Mutiny: A member tries to take over the group, either by challenging you to a fight or by an underhanded method like attacking you while you sleep. You may handle this as a combat encounter or attempt a DC 25 Bluff, Intimidate, or Profession (soldier) check. If you succeed, the instigator leaves and you lose 1 point of Labor but gain 1d2 points of Influence. If you fail, you lose control of the Mercenary Company as if from <a href="rules15bd.html?Name=Upkeep%20Phase&amp;Category=Downtime%20Phases">business attrition</a>.

Rivalry: Another mercenary group is stealing jobs from your organization. Treat this as the <a href="rules0609.html?Name=Generic%20Building%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">rivalry event from Generic Building Events</a>), except you can also end the rivalry and gain 1d4 points of Influence by beating the leader in a duel (as the <a href="rules2355.html?Name=Military%20Academy%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">duel Military Academy event</a> on page 122, but not necessarily to the death).

Scandal: Some sort of scandal strikes your company-a member is accused of murder or one of your teams injures locals in a bar fight. For 2d4 days you lose 1d2 points of Influence each day and the organization takes a -5 penalty on checks to generate capital. Once per day, you can attempt to repair the damage to your reputation and end the event with a DC 20 Bluff or Diplomacy check. Failure extends the duration of the scandal's fallout by another 1d4 days.

Schism: This functions as the <a href="rulesad08.html?Name=Cult%20Events&amp;Category=Organization%20Events">schism from the Cult Events section</a>, except that the skills you can use to attempt to end it are Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Profession (soldier), and that succeeding at the check means you lose 1 point of Labor and the event ends.

Windfall: Your organization is rewarded handsomely for its recent efforts, either with payment from a grateful employer or rich spoils from looting an enemy. You gain 1d10 ?? 10 gp, 1d6 points of Goods, and 1 point of Magic.

Big Heist: You have the opportunity to take on a risky but profitable job. If you accept, attempt a DC 30 Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check. If you succeed, the guild gains a +20 bonus on its next check to generate capital and you gain 1d4 points of Influence. If you fail, the guild automatically rolls a 1 on all checks to generate capital for 1 day, and you lose 1 point of Influence. If you fail by 10 or more, there's a 25% chance that a team involved in the heist is captured (treat this as the entrapment event).

Crackdown: Local authorities are going out of their way to stifle crime. For 1d6 days, your guild takes a -5 penalty on checks to generate capital, and if you fail a DC 20 Stealth check by 10 or more, one of your teams is captured (as the entrapment event described below).

Crime Spree: Lady Luck has her eye on the settlement's criminals. For 1d4 days, your guild gains a +5 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day. Each of these days you use the guild to generate capital, there's 10% chance you have to deal with a meddling adventurers event as described below.

Entrapment: A lucrative job turns out to be a plot by the city guard to catch thieves, and one of your teams is arrested. You must spend 5 points of Influence or 1d10 ?? 5 gp to get the team out of jail; if you don't, the team members are imprisoned, or (depending on the local laws against thievery) are executed 1d10 days later. Either result costs you the entire team and 1d6 points of Influence for letting it happen. Alternatively, you can attempt to break the team out of jail-the GM should create a combat encounter or short adventure if you try this solution.

Meddling Adventurers: Unusually competent do-gooders sniff around your territory and spar with your teams. You must succeed at a DC 25 Disable Device, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth check or lose 1d6 points of Goods because of their activities. If you succeed by 10 or more, you gain 1d3 points of Influence for trouncing the adventurers. If you fail by 10 or more, one of your teams is captured (treat this as the entrapment event described above).

Mutiny: This functions like the <a href="rulesf542.html?Name=Mercenary%20Company%20Events&amp;Category=Organization%20Events">mutiny event in the Mercenary Company Events table</a>, except you may resolve the event with a different kind of challenge (such as racing through a gauntlet of traps instead of a duel, requiring several skill checks) and you can't attempt a Profession (soldier) check to end the event.

Rivalry: Another guild is moving in on your territory. Treat this as the <a href="rules0609.html?Name=Generic%20Building%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">rivalry event from Generic Building Events</a>, except you can also end the rivalry and gain 1d4 points of Influence by beating the leader in a duel (as the <a href="rulesf542.html?Name=Mercenary%20Company%20Events&amp;Category=Organization%20Events">duel event on the Mercenary Company Event table</a>, but not necessarily to the death) or a thieving challenge.
