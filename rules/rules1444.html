When you flash from the main party scene to a secondary view (a lone PC scouting, or events happening somewhere else entirely) you can create tension by flipping back and forth between the two. This works especially well if one scene is fraught with danger and mayhem, or if there's a race against the clock.

While this might seem like an ideal way to handle split parties and introduce historical events, it doesn't work for all groups. Impatient players might want to "get back to the adventure" rather than learn about events happening 1,000 miles away.
