You can roll on Table 4-29: Cloud Cover to determine the cloud cover for the day. Light and medium cloud cover mainly serve as thematic elements. Overcast conditions grant concealment for creatures flying at high altitudes. Overcast conditions without precipitation increase the temperature in fall and winter by 10?? F and decrease the temperature in spring and summer by the same amount. If precipitation occurs, the cloud cover functions as overcast.
