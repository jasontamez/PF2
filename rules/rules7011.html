All outsiders have vulnerabilities, and those who deal with them must know what these vulnerabilities are. Some binders even use weapons composed of anathematic substances to create or draw their magic circles, or may even grind such valuable weapons up to create the powder to make the circles.

For every 5,000 gp of an anathematic substance used, the caster gains a +1 bonus on the opposed Charisma check to bargain with the outsider. This destroys the substance.

Anarchic: Infused with the power of chaos, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7ea1.html?ItemName=Anarchic">anarchic</a> weapons are anathema to many lawful outsiders, even those who are not specifically vulnerable to the weapons.

Axiomatic: Empowered by law, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay10ea.html?ItemName=Axiomatic">axiomatic</a> weapons are harmful to chaotic outsiders, dealing extra damage even if the outsider is not particularly vulnerable to its effect.

Alchemical Silver: While a weapon made of alchemical silver reduces damage by 1, with a minimum of 1 point of damage, it may be more effective than other weapons against certain outsiders. It has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.

Cold Iron: Effective against daemons, demons, and fey, cold iron has been drawn from deep beneath forbidding mountains and forged with the least heat possible. Because of the delicacy and difficulty of the process, a weapon made of cold iron costs twice as much to make, and every magical enhancement increases its price significantly. It has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.

Holy: A <a href="magicweaponsdisplay86e5.html?ItemName=Holy">holy</a> weapon is any weapon imbued with holy power, which allows it to bypass damage reduction for specific evil creatures and inflict an additional 2d6 points of damage on those monsters. Evil outsiders that do not have a specific vulnerability to holy weapons still take that additional damage if the weapon overcomes the creature's damage reduction.

Mithral: Most outsiders react to mithral in the same way that they do to actual silver.

Silver: Long revered for its purity and ability to harm lycanthropes and devils, silver is also used to trap certain kinds of good outsiders.

Unholy: The opposite of the holy weapon, an <a href="magicweaponsdisplay85c0.html?ItemName=Unholy">unholy</a> weapon inflicts its damage on good-aligned outsiders, but is in other respects the same.
