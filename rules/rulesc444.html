Perks are beneficial adjustments to an item, often gained from critical success at a challenge. The strongest perks tend to have the highest numbers on the table below. Reroll duplicates and perks that don't fit the item. Feel free to invent your own perks or apply an appropriate perk without rolling.

2 Item must be one that delivers effects upon touch, such as a staff or a wand.
3 Item must be a weapon.
4 Item must be a weapon, armor, or an activated item.
5 Item must be activated by a command word.

Draconic: Determine a random type of chromatic or metallic dragon. The item has a sheen in the color of that dragon's scales, and grants its bearer 3 points of energy resistance against the damage type that dragon's breath weapon deals.

Durable: The item has twice as many hit points as it normally would.

Eager: The item always wants to be worn or held by its owner. The owner can draw an eager weapon or handheld item as a swift action, don eager armor in half the time, and don any other eager item as a swift action, though it takes twice as long as normal to remove eager armor and 1 full round to remove or stow any other eager item. The DC to disarm or steal an eager item increases by 5.

Egoistic: All of the bearer's feats and class features that affect a specific weapon or weapon group change to affect the egoistic weapon's type or group as long as she possesses the weapon. If the bearer can specify more than one type or group, she can choose which weapon or group she retains and which switch to the egoistic weapon's type or group.

Enemy Glow: The item glows when a specific type of creature is nearby. Either choose an appropriate type or roll one randomly on the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger's favored enemy list</a>.

Energetic: The item deals 1 additional point of damage of an energy type randomly determined upon creation. This damage isn't multiplied on a critical hit.

Energy-Kissed: The item is immune to a random type of energy, but doesn't grant this immunity to its bearer.

Exemplar: The item is a perfect example of its kind, granting advantages against similar items. Exemplar weapons grant a +1 AC bonus against other weapons of that type (such as longswords), armors grant a +1 bonus on attack rolls against enemies wearing that type of armor (such as breastplates), and activated items grant a +1 bonus on saving throws against other items of that exact function (so a <a href="magicstavesdisplay9aca.html?ItemName=Staff%20of%20Fire">staff of fire</a> would grant its benefit against other staves of fire, but not against any other staves).

Faithful: The item's caster level is treated as 1 higher when its effects benefit the faithful of its creator's patron deity or when used against worshipers of one faith hated by that deity (selected by the creator if the patron hates multiple faiths). The item also gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls against hated worshipers. If more than one creator qualifies, the creators must choose one of their patrons.

Hated Foe: The weapon deals 1 additional point of damage when it hits a specific type of creature. Either choose an appropriate type or roll one randomly on the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger's favored enemy list</a>.

Healthful: The bearer of this item regains 1 additional hit point from any magical effect that causes her to regain hit points.

Impervious: The item's hardness is 5 higher than usual.

Inscribed: The item's bearer can spend a full-round action to inscribe a hidden message up to 25 words long on the item's surface. This message remains invisible until either the next time a creature holds the item or a specific passphrase is spoken. Inscribing a new message erases the previous one.

Lightweight: The item weighs half as much as normal.

Lucky: Each day, there's a 50% chance the item grants its bearer a +1 luck bonus on a random type of saving throw for that day.

Lunar: While exposed to moonlight, this item causes any enemy adjacent to the bearer to take a -1 penalty on saving throws against sleep and similar effects.

Messenger: Once per week, the item can transform into an animal and deliver a message as the <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a> spell.

Mindlinked: The item is linked to the owner, who can command it mentally. The action cost is the same, but it doesn't make noise and the activation is purely mental.

Potent: The item's caster level is 1 higher than intended.

Resizing: This item automatically resizes itself to match the size of its bearer. The size change takes 1 minute.

Sacred: The item glows with the image of its creator's holy or unholy symbol, counting as a holy or unholy symbol for all purposes. If more than one creator qualifies, the creators choose one of their patrons' holy or unholy symbols.

Shielding: This item negates the first <a href="spelldisplay2658.html?ItemName=magic%20missile">magic missile</a> directed at it or its bearer each day. If a caster directs multiple missiles at the bearer simultaneously, reduce the number of missiles that strike the bearer by one.

Skillful: The item grants a +1 competence bonus on checks with a random skill.

Solar: While exposed to sunlight, this item causes an enemy adjacent to the bearer to become dazzled for as long as the two remain adjacent.

Spying: The item transmits sensory information to its owner, as if it were the sensor for a <a href="spelldisplayb3d4.html?ItemName=clairaudience/clairvoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a> spell. The owner must concentrate on receiving this information instead of her own visual or auditory information as a standard action to gain this benefit, and the effect becomes inert while she isn't concentrating. Determine randomly upon the item's creation whether the item relays visual or auditory information.

Tentacled Touch: As the aberrant quirk, but the tentacles can extend, allowing the item to deliver any touch effects with an additional 5 feet of reach. This does not increase the weapon reach of a magic weapon.

Unassuming: The item registers as though it were nonmagical, as though affected by a <a href="spelldisplay8593.html?ItemName=magic%20aura">magic aura</a> spell.
