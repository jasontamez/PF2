The monstrous four-armed demon spoke in a surprisingly pleasant tenor voice. "And what, pray tell, is it you so desire"? Seltyiel paused, steeling his resolve. "I wish suffering for my family, tenfold for each wrong visited upon myself. I wish the lord mayor's daughter and rank, and his head resting beneath my boot. I wish for such wealth that even a Qadiran merchant would weep with envy." The demon's laugh boomed throughout the cavern. "And what, pray tell, is it you so desire"?

More so than almost any other ability, <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> and its cousin <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> have the potential to drastically change a campaign. When your players reach the upper echelons of the game at 15th level and beyond, you should consider whether or not you want to allow your players access to <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a>, as even if they can't buy them, they'll soon enough be able to cast the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell themselves.

The easiest way to control wish is to restrict it to those options listed in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. None of these uses are game-breaking. However, by expanding the boundaries of <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> and <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a>, you open up roleplaying and story opportunities that can keep your high-level game fresh and exciting for many adventures to come.

Types of Wishes: One of the first boundaries to set is whether or not all wishes are created equal, and have similar constraints. Treating all <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> the same has the virtues of consistency and simplicity, and helps keep your game under control. Having a hierarchy of <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> gives fodder for the story in your game, letting PCs alter their local reality with their wishes, but leaving the option of seeking out higher powers to grant the wishes spoken of in legends. A suggested hierarchy is <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> from spells or magic items, followed by <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a>, <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> granted by artifacts and relics, <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> granted by powerful outsiders like the efreet and djinn, and finally those <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> bestowed directly by gods and other entities beyond mortal ken.

Making Good Wishes: The best <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> are short, unambiguous, related to matters immediately at hand, and usually aimed at a simple (if powerful) task. A <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> for a sundered <a href="magicwondrousdisplaybae6.html?FinalName=Mirror%20of%20Mental%20Prowess">mirror of mental prowess</a> to be made whole or a <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> to reveal the identity of the thief of the crown jewels is unlikely to go awry.

Making Bad Wishes: <a href="spelldisplay6e27.html?ItemName=Wishes">Wishes</a> born of greed or vengeance have a way of turning sour. Attempts to guard against mishap with a list of conditions and qualifiers are rarely successful, most often resulting in partial fulfillment of the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a>. <a href="spelldisplay6e27.html?ItemName=Wishes">Wishes</a> that stretch the limits of the power granting them are always ill advised. If the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> is from a spell or magic item, failure or backlash is likely, while if the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> is from an outside source, the granter of the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> may be angered by mortal temerity and twist the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> or otherwise seek retribution against the wisher.

Twisting Wishes: Folklore is filled with tales of <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> gone awry, bringing heartbreak, misery, and perhaps eventually wisdom to the hapless wisher. The <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> most likely to be perverted away from the wisher's intent are <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> granted by hostile outsiders, <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> from cursed objects, and bad <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> as described above. Evil outsiders in particular are loath to grant <a href="spelldisplay17ed.html?ItemName=wishes">wishes</a> that don't serve evil ends, and take every opportunity to twist them toward harm and suffering. A <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> for eternal life may leave the wisher imprisoned in a decrepit yet still undying body. A <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> for a powerful magic item can be granted by stealing the item from a powerful and vengeful lord. <a href="spelldisplay6e27.html?ItemName=Wishes">Wishes</a> are best turned awry by adhering closely to the letter of the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a>, but violating the spirit.

Deferred Results: Rather than denying a particularly powerful <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a>, such as for the throne of a kingdom, the <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> can be granted over an extended period. The <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> subtly reshapes reality, guiding the wisher through seeming coincidence, good fortune, and the timely appearance of helpful NPCs. Success is not assured unless the PC takes advantage of her opportunities.
