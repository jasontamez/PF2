This chapter features numerous examples of races designed with the race builder. Sidebars early in the chapter offer detailed examples of races found in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, Bestiary 2, and Bestiary 3 that would normally have racial Hit Dice, skills, and other abilities. PC members of such races, however, calculate these benefits based solely on their class. Note that these races are only an approximation of their monstrous counterparts and may not match exactly. Later in the chapter, sidebars detail entirely new races created using the race builder rules. Lastly, the final section of the chapter breaks down the points and abilities of core races and many of the featured and uncommon races.
