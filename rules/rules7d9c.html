When your character's current hit points drop to a negative amount equal to his Constitution score or lower, or if he succumbs to massive damage, he's dead. A character can also die from taking ability damage or suffering an ability drain that reduces his Constitution score to 0 (see Appendix 1).

Certain types of powerful magic, such as raise dead and resurrection, can restore life to a dead character. See Chapter 9 for more information.
