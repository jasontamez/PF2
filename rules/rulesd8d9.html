If there's no effect in <a href="rules3cd2.html?Name=Magic%20Item%20Gold%20Piece%20Values&amp;Category=Magic%20Item%20Creation">Table 15-29</a> that matches the new item's powers, try looking through existing magic items for something that's close. For example, Seltyiel wants to add the bladethirst ability to his longsword, a power he's come up with that lets him draw the weapon as a free action. This is essentially the <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a> feat, but tied to a single weapon. Even though it's a weapon enhancement, Seltyiel wants it as a flat cost, like adding fire resistance to a suit of armor. Looking over the ability, the GM decides that this fits well, since it doesn't really scale up with a more powerful weapon. <a href="magicwondrousdisplay8b1e.html?FinalName=Gloves%20of%20Arrow%20Snaring">Gloves of arrow snaring</a> are a 4,000 gp item that grants a feat, so the GM uses this as the base price. Multiple different abilities on a magic item would normally increase this cost by 50%, but since the <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a> feat would allow drawing items other than just a single weapon, the GM splits the difference and makes it a 5,000 gp weapon enhancement.
