While smaller settlements like towns and forts can sometimes exist in barely tenable situations, often for strategic military reasons, most realistic cities have a few basic requirements that must be met. <ul><li>Access to sufficient food and fresh water (for both drinking and sanitation). </li><li>Centralized authority, whether king or council, to provide protection, and taxes levied by those authorities to help pay for walls, guardsmen, weaponry, and other defenses against invasion. </li><li>Infrastructure to provide food and basic necessities. </li><li>Craftsmen and specialists, and importation of raw materials for those artisans. </li><li>A reason to exist: Why is the city here, and not 20 miles down the road? Does it have strategic importance or natural resources, or is it a crossroads for trade?</li></ul>
