Aside from the players, every other person encountered in the game world is a nonplayer character (NPC). These characters are designed and controlled by the GM to fill every role from noble king to simple baker. While some of these characters use player classes, most rely upon basic NPC classes, allowing them to be easily generated. The following rules govern all of the NPC classes and include information on generating quick NPCs for an evening's game.

The world that the player characters inhabit should be full of rich and vibrant characters with whom they can interact. While most need little more than names and general descriptions, some require complete statistics, such as town guards, local clerics, and wizened sages. The PCs might find themselves in combat with these characters, either against them or as allies. Alternatively the PCs might find themselves relying on the skills and abilities of the NPCs. In either case, the process for creating these NPCs can be performed in seven simple steps.

<a href="rulesec78.html?Name=Step%201:%20The%20Basics&amp;Category=Creating%20NPCs">Step 1: The Basics</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 450</a>
The first step in making an NPC is to determine its basic role in your campaign. This includes its race, class, and basic concept.

<a href="rules8e2f.html?Name=Step%202:%20Determine%20Ability%20Scores&amp;Category=Creating%20NPCs">Step 2: Determine Ability Scores</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 450</a>
Once the character's basic concept has been determined, its ability scores must be assigned. Apply the NPC's racial modifiers after the scores have been assigned. For every four levels the NPC has attained, increase one of its scores by 1. If the NPC possesses levels in a PC class, it is considered a heroic NPC and receives better ability scores. These scores can be assigned in any order.

Basic NPCs: The ability scores for a basic NPC are: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 8.

Heroic NPCs: The ability scores for a heroic NPC are: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8.

Preset Ability Scores: Instead of assigning the scores, you can use Table 14-6 to determine the NPC's ability scores, adjusting them as necessary to fit. Use the Melee NPC ability scores for characters whose primary role involves melee combat, such as barbarians, fighters, monks, paladins, rangers, and warriors. The Ranged NPC ability scores are for characters that fight with ranged weapons or use their Dexterity to hit, such as fighters, rangers, and rogues. Use the Divine NPC ability scores for characters with divine spellcasting capabilities, such as adepts, clerics, and druids. The Arcane NPC ability scores should be used by characters with arcane spellcasting capabilities, such as bards, sorcerers, and wizards. Finally, the Skill NPC ability scores should be used for characters that focus on skill use, such as aristocrats, bards, commoners, experts, and rogues. Some NPCs might not fit into one of these categories and should have custom ability scores.

Table 14-6: NPC Ability Scores

<a href="rules974d.html?Name=Step%203:%20Skills&amp;Category=Creating%20NPCs">Step 3: Skills</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 451</a>
To assign skills precisely, total up the number of skill ranks possessed by the character and assign them normally.

Remember that the number of ranks in an individual skill that a character can possess is limited by his total HD. For simpler skill generation, refer to Table 14-8 to determine the total number of skill selections the NPC possesses. After selecting that number of skills, mostly from the class skills lists of the NPC's class, the NPC receives a number of ranks in each skill equal to his level. If the NPC has two classes, start by selecting skills for the class with the fewest number of skill selections. The NPC receives a number of ranks in those skills equal to his total character level. Next, find the difference in the number of selections between the first class and the other class possessed by the NPC. Select that number of new skills and give the NPC a number of ranks in those skills equal to his level in the second class. For example, a human fighter 3/monk 4 with a +1 Intelligence modifier can select four skills for his fighter class (since it receives fewer selections). These four skills each have seven ranks (equal to his total level). Next, he selects a number of skills equal to the difference between the fighter and the monk classes, in this case two skills. These two skills each have four ranks (his monk level).

If the NPC has three or more classes, you must use the precise method for determining his skills.

Once all of the NPC's ranks have been determined, assign class skill bonuses and apply the bonus or penalty from the NPC's relevant ability score.<table class="inner"><tr><td>PC Class</td><td>Skill Selections*</td><td>NPC Class</td><td>Skill Selections*</td></tr><tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>4 + Int Mod</td><td>Adept</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td></tr><tr><td>Bard</td><td>6 + Int Mod</td><td>Aristocrat</td><td>4 + Int Mod</td></tr><tr><td>Cleric</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td><td>Commoner</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td></tr><tr><td>Druid</td><td>4 + Int Mod</td><td>Expert</td><td>6 + Int Mod</td></tr><tr><td>Fighter</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td><td>Warrior</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td></tr><tr><td>Monk</td><td>4 + Int Mod</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>Paladin</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>Ranger</td><td>6 + Int Mod</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>Rogue</td><td>8 + Int Mod</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>Sorcerer</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>Wizard</td><td>2 + Int Mod</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr></table>* Humans receive one additional skill selection.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 452</a>
After skills have been determined, the next step is to assign the NPC's feats. Start by assigning all of the feats granted through class abilities. Next, assign the feats garnered from the NPC's total character level (one feat for every two levels beyond 1st). Remember that humans receive an additional feat at 1st level. For simplified feat choices, select feats from the lists provided for the following character types.

After determining feats, the next step is to fill in all the class features possessed by the NPC. This is the time to make decisions about the NPC's spell selection, rage powers, rogue talents, and other class-based abilities.

When it comes to spells, determine how many spell selections you need to make for each level. Choose a variety of spells for the highest two levels of spells possessed by the NPC. For all other levels, stick to a few basic spells, prepared multiple times (if possible). If this NPC is slated to appear in only one encounter (such as a combat), leaving off lower-level spells entirely is an acceptable way to speed up generation, especially if the NPC is unlikely to cast those spells. You can always choose a few during play if they are needed.

<a href="rulesd93e.html?Name=Step%206:%20Gear&amp;Category=Creating%20NPCs">Step 6: Gear</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 453</a>
After recording all of the NPC's class features, the next step is to outfit the character with gear appropriate to his level. Note that NPCs receive less gear than PCs of an equal level. If an NPC is a recurring character, his gear should be selected carefully. Use the total gp value found on Table 14-9 to determine how much gear he should carry. NPCs that are only scheduled to appear once can have a simpler gear selection. Table 14-9 includes a number of categories to make it easier to select an NPC's gear. When outfitting the character, spend the listed amount on each category by purchasing as few items as possible. Leftover gold from any category can be spent on any other category. Funds left over at the end represent coins and jewelry carried by the character.

Note that these values are approximate and based on the values for a campaign using the medium experience progression and a normal treasure allotment. If your campaign is using the fast experience progression, treat your NPCs as one level higher when determining their gear. If your campaign is using the slow experience progression, treat the NPCs as one level lower when determining their gear. If your campaign is high fantasy, double these values. Reduce them by half if your campaign is low fantasy. If the final value of an NPC's gear is a little over or under these amounts, that's okay.

Weapons: This includes normal, masterwork, and magic weapons, as well as magic staves and wands used by spellcasters to harm their enemies. For example, a wand of scorching ray would count as a weapon, but a staff of life would count as a piece of magic gear.

Protection: This category includes armor and shields, as well as any magic item that augments a character's Armor Class or saving throws.

Magic: This category includes all other permanent magic items. Most rings, rods, and wondrous items fit into this category.

Limited Use: Items that fall into this category include alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands with few charges. Charged wondrous items fall into this grouping as well.

Gear: Use the amount in this category to purchase standard nonmagical gear for the character. In most cases, this equipment can be omitted during creation and filled in as needed during play. You can assume that the character has whatever gear is needed for him to properly use his skills and class abilities. This category can also include jewelry, gems, or loose coins that the NPC might have on his person.

Once you have assigned all of the NPC's gear, all that remains is to fill out the details. Determine the character's attack and damage bonuses, CMB, CMD, initiative modifier, and Armor Class. If the character's magic items affect his skills or ability scores, make sure to take those changes into account. Determine the character's total hit points by assuming the average result. Finally, fill out any other important details, such as name, alignment, religion, and a few personality traits to round him out.

Looking over your notes for the evening's game, you discover that you need a mysterious forest character for the PCs to interact with on their way to town. If things go poorly, they might have to f ight him. Since your party consists of 4th-level characters, you decide to make this forest guardian an elven ranger 4/rogue 2. You want him to be skilled at f ighting with ranged weapons, but you also want him to be competent with a rapier. Taking this into account, you use the heroic ability scores for a ranged NPC found on Table 14-6. Since he is an elf, you apply the racial modifiers to Dexterity, Constitution, and Intelligence. Since he is 6th level, you put his bonus attribute point gained at 4th level into his Dexterity, raising it up to 18. Moving on to skills, you see that rangers receive fewer skill selections than rogues, so you start by selecting skills for the ranger. You add two for his Intelligence modifier for a total of eight skills at six ranks each. After selecting these eight skills, you move on to the rogue skills. The difference between the ranger and the rogue is two, meaning that you can select two more skills, with two ranks in each. After selecting his skills, you move on to his feats. Starting with his class feats, you select Rapid Shot as his ranger combat style feat. In addition, the forest guardian receives three additional feats for his class levels. Since you want him to be skilled at archery, most of these feats come from the ranged list, including Deadly Aim and Point Blank Shot. To ensure that he is good with a rapier, you spend his final feat selection on Weapon Finesse. Next you note all of his class and racial features, making whatever selections are necessary, such as favored enemy, favored terrain, hunter's bond, and rogue talents. Moving on to gear, you assign gear using the line for a 6th-level heroic NPC, giving him a +1 longbow, a masterwork rapier, +1 studded leather armor, a potion of invisibility, a potion of cure moderate wounds, and a pack full of nonmagic gear. Although he has a bit more gp in weapons than the chart allows, he has spent a bit less in armor, roughly balancing him out. With your task nearly completed, you add all of his statistics and details, naming him Kiramor. Your forest shadow is then ready to face off against the PCs.
