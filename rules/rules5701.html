Though the rules on when to use wild magic are deliberately vague to give the GM leeway, here are some suggestions, presented in order from simplest to most complex.

Failed Concentration: When a caster fails a concentration check, and thereby loses a spell, some of the spell's energy escapes in a wild magic surge.

Dispel and Counterspell: When a spell or magical effect is dispelled or counterspelled, it triggers a wild magic surge on the caster or subject.

Wild Zones: Some places are magically unstable. When a creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item in such an area, it causes a wild magic surge.

Boost Casting: A caster can attempt to use a <a href="featsc9d0.html?Category=Metamagic">metamagic feat</a> she has with a spell she's casting without expending a higher-level spell slot, needing to prepare the spell at a higher level (if a prepared caster), or increasing the casting time (if a spontaneous caster). To do so, she must attempt a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level + 5 for every increase in spell level the metamagic feat would normally cause. If she succeeds, her spell gains the metamagic feat's benefit and she causes a wild magic surge. If she fails, she still rolls on Table 4-4, but subtracts from the result a number equal to the amount by which she failed the check.
