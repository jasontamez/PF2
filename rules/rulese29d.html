High-Constitution monsters beef up their resistance to being hurt with tough combat options.

Damage Reduction: The monster gains damage reduction. Cross-reference the monster's CR band and the type of damage that bypasses the reduction to find the value of the monster's DR on the table below. For DR that requires more than one damage type to bypass, the DR equals the lower value - 5. (If this reduces it to 0, this type of DR is probably too strong.)

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>CR</td><td>Type*</td><td>Material</td><td>Magic</td><td>Alignment</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>0-5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>6-10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>11-15</td><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>16-20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>15</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>21+</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>30</td><td>20</td><td>15</td></tr></table> * A bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing weapon.

Diehard: When reduced to below 0 hit points, this monster automatically stabilizes and can remain conscious.

Energy Resistance: The monster gains resistance 10 against two energy types. For every 5 CR the monster has, increase the amount of energy resistance by 5, or increase the number of resistances by one. For example, a CR 17 monster might have three resistances at 10 or two resistances at 15.

Extra Armor: Increase the monster's AC by 2 and its flat-footed AC by 4. Decrease its touch AC by 6. Reduce the monster's speed by 10 feet if this change comes from manufactured armor.

Extra Hit Points: Increase the monster's hit point total by 20%.

Immunity: The monster gains immunity from one energy type, affliction, condition, or spell of your choice, plus one additional immunity for every 5 CR it has.

Spell Resistance: The monster gains spell resistance equal to its CR + 11.

Stalwart: When the monster succeeds at a Fortitude or Reflex saving throw against an effect that normally has a reduced effect on a successful save, the monster instead avoids the effect entirely. At CR 8, it also takes only the reduced effect if it fails its save.
