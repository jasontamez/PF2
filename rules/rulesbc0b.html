Sanity damage can be reduced in a number of ways. The first is with time and rest. For every 7 full days of uninterrupted rest, you can reduce the sanity damage you have taken by amount of equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Instead of relying on your own strength of personality to reduce the effects of sanity damage, you can seek out a single confidante, mentor, priest, or other advisor. You must meet with that person regularly (at least 8 hours per day) and gain guidance during the 7 days of rest. At the end of the rest period, the ally can attempt a Wisdom or Intelligence check (whichever score is higher) with a DC of 15 if your sanity damage is below your sanity edge or 20 otherwise. If the ally succeeds at this check, you can add the ally's Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher) to the amount of sanity damage you remove.

Sanity damage can also be reduced with magic. A single casting of <a href="spelldisplayc2fb.html?ItemName=restoration,%20lesser">lesser restoration</a> reduces sanity damage by 1d2 points up to once per day; <a href="spelldisplay1364.html?ItemName=restoration">restoration</a> reduces sanity damage by 2d4 points up to once per day; and <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> reduces the amount of sanity damage by 3d4 points up to once per day. <a href="spelldisplay7255.html?ItemName=restoration,%20greater">Greater restoration</a>, <a href="spelldisplayfca1.html?ItemName=psychic%20surgery">psychic surgery</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay6497.html?ItemName=limited%20wish">limited wish</a> reduce your total sanity damage to 0 if your total sanity damage was already below your sanity edge; otherwise, these spells reduce your total sanity damage to 1 point below your sanity edge. <a href="spelldisplay2e34.html?ItemName=Miracle">Miracle</a> and <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> instantly reduce your sanity damage to 0, regardless of whether your total sanity damage was below your sanity edge.



Tenacious Sanity

In a particularly horror-themed game, the GM may consider removing some or all of the magical options to reduce sanity damage, relying on rest alone to recover sanity. For the most terror, she could even make sanity damage irrecoverable. In these cases, the GM should consider increasing the characters' sanity scores and sanity edges to ensure the heroes can make it through enough of the adventure before they snap.
