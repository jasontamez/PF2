There are three levels of power among the divine, although divinities of all levels wield vast power, especially when compared to a lowly mortal.

<a href="rules772a.html?Name=Deity&amp;Category=Divine%20Power">Deity</a>

The most powerful category among the divine are full-fledged deities. These divinities exist beyond the concept of rules, do not have stat blocks, and thus cannot be slain in simple combat. A deity can change reality, undo any mortal magic, restore or snuff out life, or do any other thing required for the story you wish to tell.

Deities grant their clerics access to five domains.

Unlike a deity, a demigod is represented in game with statistics, ranging in power from CR 26 to CR 30. <a href="monsterfamilies8675.html?ItemName=Archdevil">Archdevils</a>, <a href="monsterfamilies79a6.html?ItemName=Demon%20Lord">demon lords</a>, <a href="monsterfamiliescd5b.html?ItemName=Empyreal%20Lord">empyreal lords</a>, and <a href="monsterfamilies287c.html?ItemName=Great%20Old%20One">Great Old Ones</a> are all examples of demigods. A demigod who controls a planar realm can effect physical change in that realm by thought, but such changes are not instantaneous. Beyond the reach of its realm, a demigod must rely upon its own abilities and magic to effect such changes.

Demigods grant their clerics access to four domains.

Quasi deities are the least powerful of the divine, and the most eclectic in their nature. A quasi deity has a stat block, and can be of any CR (although the vast majority lie in the CR 21-25 range). Nascent demon lords, the malebranche, and qlippoth lords are all examples of quasi deities, as are creatures like <a href="monsterdisplay89e8.html?ItemName=Deep%20One,%20Elder">deep one elders</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay802e.html?ItemName=Conqueror%20Worm">conqueror worms</a>, and <a href="monsterdisplay9fa8.html?ItemName=Green%20Men">green men</a>, who have the ability to grant spells to clerics. Mythic characters who take the <a href="pathabilities61d3.html?Path=Universal">divine source path ability</a> are also quasi deities.

Quasi deities have no inborn ability to shape and alter reality by thought alone, even if they somehow gain control of a planar realm, and must rely upon their own abilities and magic to effect changes of this nature.

A quasi deity grants from one to four domains to its clerics.
