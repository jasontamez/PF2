<a href="rules06c0.html?Name=Reading%20a%20Deity%20Stat%20Block&amp;Category=The%20Core%20Pantheon">Reading a Deity Stat Block</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpya1am">Planar Adventures pg. 73</a>
Each of the core pantheon's deities are presented below in stat block format for ease of reference.

Name and Title: The deity's name and its common title.

Alignment, Gender, and Areas of Concern: The gender of a deity is indicated by use of "god" or "goddess" in this entry. A deity's areas of concern represent those aspects of reality in which it has the most interest and influence.

Realm: This entry gives the name of the deity's realm, followed by the plane on which that realm is located.

Allies: This entry lists deities among the core pantheon who have allied with the god or goddess in question.

Relations: If the deity is related in some way to another deity of the core pantheon, that information is presented here. Although many deities are related to deities or demigods outside the core pantheon, those relationships are not listed in this book. A special relationship that deserves additional clarification is "ascended sibling." Three of the core deities (<a href="deitydisplay3a22.html?ItemName=Cayden%20Cailean">Cayden Cailean</a>, <a href="deitydisplay813c.html?ItemName=Iomedae">Iomedae</a>, and <a href="deitydisplaycd2c.html?ItemName=Norgorber">Norgorber</a>) ascended from mortality via a harrowing quest known as the Test of the Starstone, and while these three deities are often at odds, they share an unshakable bond in that all three became deities in the same way.

Enemies: This entry lists deities among the core pantheon who are active enemies to the god or goddess in question.

Symbol: A description of the deity's symbol.

Temples: This describes typical places of worship.

Sacred Animal: With the exception of <a href="deitydisplayc8b7.html?ItemName=Gozreh">Gozreh</a> (whose faith holds all animals as sacred), each of the core deities' faiths holds a specific animal as particularly sacred. A deity's sacred animal often appears with the deity in artistic depictions, and some are kept as pets or guardians on temple grounds.

Sacred Colors: With the exception of <a href="deitydisplay13ee.html?ItemName=Shelyn">Shelyn</a> (whose faith sees beauty and sacred significance in all colors), worshipers of the core pantheon typically associate two colors as sacred for each deity. These colors are typically incorporated into holy raiment or clothing worn by worshipers.

Holy Days: The days listed here are held as particularly sacred by the faith, and reasons for each day's significance to the faith along with the time of year at which the holy day occurs are listed in parentheses. Most faiths maintain several less important or regional holy days as well, but these are not listed here. These dates are listed using real-world days and months to avoid confusion. The names of days and months can vary in your campaign, as they do in the world of Golarion.

Domains, Subdomains: The domains and subdomains the deity grants to its clerics are listed here.

Favored Weapon: This lists the deity's favored weapon.

Worshipers: The worshipers listed here are the most common agents of the deity in question, but this list is not exhaustive. Because all 20 faiths count clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests among their worshipers, these four classes are not listed so as to avoid repetition.

Minions: As opposed to those that typically worship the deity, minions are the outsider races that often serve the deity. A deity's minions can often be encountered in temples and other places sacred to the deity, but more often they enter play when a worshiper of the deity calls upon one of the minions using magic like <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a> or <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a>.

Herald: This lists the name of the deity's herald. A deity's herald is a unique creature who serves as a messenger and emissary. Heralds are typically CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available via greater planar ally (<a href="deitydisplaya42b.html?ItemName=Rovagug">Rovagug's</a> herald, the <a href="monsterdisplay0340.html?ItemName=Tarrasque">Tarrasque</a>, is a significant exception to this rule).

Divine Gift: These gifts are thematically appropriate boons the deity might grant, but are certainly not the only types of gifts the deity might hand out. Unless otherwise noted, any abilities granted by a divine gift can be used only once per gift.
