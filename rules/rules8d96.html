Monsters can be truly memorable and entertaining, but they can also be a lot of work if the GM needs to customize them or create new ones. The standard methods for creating monsters and NPCs are similar to those for creating player characters, but striking the right power balance can be challenging.

The simple monster creation system presented here lets you create a monster and have it ready for your table quickly. This means bending the normal rules to cut out time-consuming steps, such as picking a ton of 1st-level spells a monster is unlikely to cast, selecting magic items according to an NPC's budget, or recalculating statistics based on spell effects. Rather than making you build a monster from scratch, this system uses baselines derived from Table 1-1: Monster Statistics by CR on page 291 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. This gives you the flexibility to start off with almost-final statistics and make a few adjustments as needed to create a formidable unchained monster.

<a href="rulesaa9f.html?Name=Step%201:%20Array&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 1: Array</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 196</a>
The arrays presented in this chapter allow you to quickly derive the statistics for three broad types of monsters. Each one allows for a fair amount of customization-especially through monster options-but the monster's statistics stay close to the baselines set by PC progressions and Table 1-1 in the Bestiary. The options roughly correspond to the combat, skill, and spell roles used for monster advancement in the normal monster creation system. Therefore, if you were to recreate a monster with the combat role (such as an ogre or vrock), you would start with the combatant array. You can choose whichever array you prefer, unless the monster is meant to mimic an NPC created with a character class from <a href="rules7ba1.html?Name=Step%202:%20Creature%20Type%20or%20Class%20Graft&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 2</a> or a template from <a href="rules3941.html?Name=Step%204:%20Template%20Graft&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 4</a>. The three arrays are as follows.

Combatant: Any monster that focuses primarily on its physical power uses the combatant array. High attack bonuses, hit points, and defenses are the defining traits of this array. A combatant's skills are weak, and the majority of its options are in the combat category. Most creatures of low or no Intelligence should be combatants, as should intelligent monsters with combat training.

Expert: A monster uses the expert array if it's focused on skills, interaction, or cunning tactics. This array provides moderate statistics in most areas, but strong skills and extensive monster options. The expert array is the ideal way to replicate skill-based NPCs such as rogues or bards. In many cases, expert monsters are more likely to attempt tricking or befriending the PCs than fight.

Spellcaster: If a monster relies primarily on spells, it uses the spellcaster array. Though the monster's statistics are typically weak overall, it gains access to a sizable number of spells from the lists in <a href="rulesba5c.html?Name=Step%206:%20Spells&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 6</a>. Because this system uses benchmark numbers instead of calculating individual statistics, a monster that uses its spells primarily to increase its own abilities (so that it can become a strong melee combatant, for instance) should use the array that best matches the way it will be used in the game rather than using the spellcaster array just because it can cast magic.

<a href="rules7ba1.html?Name=Step%202:%20Creature%20Type%20or%20Class%20Graft&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 2: Creature Type or Class Graft</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 204</a>
With the normal monster creation system, foundational statistics such as base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and hit points are calculated from a monster's creature type and class levels. In this system, a monster's array sets its main statistics based on the broad role and CR it fits into. Creature types and classes then adjust those statistics to better resemble a particular monster concept.

Creature types and character classes are represented by "grafts"-groups of adjustments applied to an array's statistics. A monster made with this system is primarily defined either by its creature type or a character class. For example, a ghoul that is a powerful cleric would most likely use the cleric class graft rather than being defined primarily as undead. A fire giant with 3 levels in bard, on the other hand, should use the humanoid creature type graft and later choose some monster options that grant bardlike abilities.

If the focus is on a creature type, choose the appropriate creature type graft and apply the adjustments in that graft as described in the next section. If the focus is on a class, still choose a creature type graft but only apply its "automatic traits" entry, then apply the class graft. Even if a dragon has 20 levels in rogue (thus using the rogue class graft), for example, it still gets a dragon's normal vision types and immunities.

<a href="rules3bae.html?Name=Step%203:%20Subtype%20Graft&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 3: Subtype Graft</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 214</a>
Find the monster's subtype (if any) in the list below and apply all abilities listed there. For monsters that replicate common PC races (such as humans or elves), the subtype includes the equivalent of their important racial traits as well. These entries don't always include all the abilities a creature gains from the subtypes as they appear in Bestiary volumes; they omit rules that are only relevant for creating the creature, those that cover the monster's noncombat abilities (such as whether it eats or sleeps), and abilities that aren't as useful for NPCs as they would be for PCs (such as a dwarf's stonecunning ability).

Subtype graft entries use a short format. After the name, each subtype entry has one to three sections listing its abilities, separated by category. Some grafts grant a monster additional senses, movement types, bonuses, or other statistic adjustments. Abilities listed under the options and skills sections are found on Step 7 and 8, respectively.

All subtype abilities are added automatically; none are optional. They're meant to be included in addition to all the skills and options you can choose for the monster based on its CR and array. Likewise, subtype entries might tell you to add particular monster options or skills. These don't count against the monster's normal number of options or skills.


<a href="rules3941.html?Name=Step%204:%20Template%20Graft&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 4: Template Graft</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 216</a>
These optional grafts replicate popular monster templates, and are applied on top of the creature type or class graft chosen for the monster. Template graft entries follow a format similar to creature type grafts.

Minimum or Maximum CR: This entry indicates what the lowest or highest possible CR for the monster can be. A header that says "CR 2+- indicates the monster's CR must be 2 or higher, and -CR 9?"?? means its CR can't be higher than 9.

Required Creature Type or Subtype: For templates that change a creature's type or subtype in the normal monster creation system, this entry shows which creature type or subtype the monster must be in order to apply the template graft.

Suggested Array: This indicates the monster array the template is most closely associated with, if any. Liches, for example, are almost always spellcasters.

Automatic Traits: All creatures with this graft gain these abilities. The automatic traits might tell you to add particular monster options or skills. These count against the monster's normal number of options, skills, and so forth, replacing them (unlike subtype grafts, which grant options and skills for free). However, even if the automatic traits would cause a monster to exceed its maximum number of options or skills, the monster still gains all of them. If the monster has a class graft, use your best judgment when replacing options to maintain the feeling of both the class and template.

Suggested Ability Modifiers: This section lists the recommended assignments for the monster's high ability scores, in order from highest to lowest. For instance, the graveknight lists "Strength, Charisma, Wisdom," meaning that when making a CR 10 graveknight, you would give it a +7 Strength modifier, a +5 Charisma modifier, and a +3 Wisdom modifier. Not all entries list modifiers for all abilities. A ghost, for example, lists only Charisma since the remaining statistics can vary, and a half-dragon doesn't have an entry at all as half-dragons are so varied.

<a href="rules57d8.html?Name=Step%205:%20Size%20Graft&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 5: Size Graft</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 217</a>
If your monster isn't Medium, apply a size graft. Because there are many other ways to alter a creature's AC, hit points, attack bonuses, and damage, these grafts don't adjust those values like size changes do in the core rules. Most headers list a minimum CR or maximum CR, as described in the previous step. Use caution if your monster is outside the minimum or maximum CR range. Touch and flat-footed AC never increase above the monster's total AC, and never decrease below 1.

<a href="rulesba5c.html?Name=Step%206:%20Spells&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 6: Spells</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 218</a>
This step is only for monsters that use the spellcaster array. For monsters that know only a few spells (rather than being focused primarily on spellcasting), choose an array other than spellcaster and give the monster the secondary spellcasting universal option in <a href="rules09c3.html?Name=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 7</a>.

The spell choices for a spellcaster monster are intentionally limited compared to those of a full NPC, since a monster created using the simple monster creation system is designed to have enough spells to last though a single battle or session. If a monster created this way ends up appearing in multiple sessions, you can swap out the spells each time, assuming that doing so fits the nature and theme of the monster.

The spells you choose for the monster during this step represent its total spellcasting arsenal for an encounter. If you want to treat some of the spells as being cast from scrolls, wands, or staves, implement them as such during play. Regardless of the source, additional spells still count against the total number the monster can cast.

You'll also notice that some types of spells don't appear on these lists-especially spells that solely increase statistics, such as <a href="spelldisplay8386.html?ItemName=bull%e2%80%99s%20strength">bull's strength</a>,<a href="spelldisplay83fd.html?ItemName=%20false%20life"> false life</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay8272.html?ItemName=mage%20armor">mage armor</a>. That's because such spells are often cast before combat, and the simple monster creation system assumes the effects of those spells are already in the monster's base numbers.

Spell DCs: To determine the DC of a spell cast by a monster, add the spell's level to the number listed in the spell DC column of the monster's array. Use the spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard level if multiple classes can cast it. If neither of those classes has the spell, use the highest spell level listed in the spell's description.

<a href="rules09c3.html?Name=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 7: Monster Options</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 228</a>
Options are the main way to specialize your monster. They represent feats, universal monster rules, magic items, and all the other abilities a monster has at its disposal beyond its statistics. There are a large number of monster options to choose from, especially compared to the number of choices you make during the other steps of the simple monster creation process. Some are active abilities (such as those that give the monster a special attack), others adjust statistics (such as the power attack option, which has the same purpose as the <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a> feat), and still others grant conditional modifiers (such as combat casting's bonus to concentration checks). Unless specified otherwise, saving throw DCs in this section use the Ability DC from the monster's array, modified by the monster's grafts.

<a href="rules7b69.html?Name=Step%208:%20Skills&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 8: Skills</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 240</a>
Skill bonuses in simple monster creation are divided into two categories: good and master. A good skill is one the monster has a significant bonus in, representing what would normally come from a moderate ability modifier and a decent number of skill ranks. A master skill is one the monster is incredibly talented with, representing a high ability modifier, full skill ranks, and possibly a significant racial bonus.

Any skills that don't have a good or master rating default to the monster's appropriate ability modifier. Monsters automatically use the good modifier for Perception without needing to spend a good skill slot on it, though they can still increase this by taking Perception as a master skill.

Each weapon and type of natural attack has a damage dice value associated with it. The values in the monster arrays from Step 1 give only the total amount of damage each attack deals. Assigning the right damage dice to each of a monster's attacks helps make it fit more naturally with the rest of the game's rules. For damage dice for natural attacks, reference Table 3-1: Natural Attacks by Size on page 302 of the Bestiary.
