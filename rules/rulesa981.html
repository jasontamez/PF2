These options are primarily useful to spellcasters, though combatants and experts blessed with magic can take them.

These options improve a monster's ability to bring minion creatures into the fight.

Children of the Night: Once per day as a standard action, the monster can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or 2d6 wolves. (If the monster is not terrestrial, it might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the monster for 1 hour.

Phantom Mount: Once per hour, the monster can summon a horse similar to a <a href="spelldisplay1cee.html?ItemName=phantom%20steed">phantom steed</a>. This mount is more substantial than a typical <a href="spelldisplay1cee.html?ItemName=phantom%20steed">phantom steed</a>, and can carry one additional rider. The mount's powers are based on the monster's total CR rather than caster level.

Powerful Summons: Increase the duration of the monster's conjuration (summoning) spells by a number of rounds equal to the monster's CR. Any creature summoned by such a spell also gains temporary hit points equal to 1/2 the monster's CR and a +2 bonus on damage rolls.

Undead Mastery: As a standard action, the monster can choose one undead creature within 50 feet. That creature must succeed at a Will save or fall under the monster's control. This control is permanent for unintelligent undead; an undead creature with an Intelligence score can attempt an additional saving throw each day to break free. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw cannot be affected again by the same monster's undead mastery for 24 hours.

A monster can control a number of undead creatures with a combined CR equal to its own CR. If this limit is exceeded, the excess undead become uncontrolled in order from longest-controlled to most recently controlled.

These magic options are most useful for aggressive monsters that use their spells to deal damage.

Bestow Major Condition: As a standard action, the monster makes a melee touch attack against one creature it can reach. On a hit, the target gains the condition (dazed, paralyzed, or stunned) that was chosen when the monster gained this option. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to end the condition.

Bestow Minor Condition: As a standard action, the monster makes a melee touch attack against one creature it can reach. On a hit, the target gains the condition (dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened) that was chosen when the monster gained this option. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to end the condition.

Bestow Moderate Condition: As a standard action, the monster makes a melee touch attack against one creature it can reach. On a hit, the target gains the condition (blinded, exhausted, frightened, or nauseated) that was chosen when the monster gained this option. Each round, the target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to end the condition.

Bypass DR: The monster's attacks count as being magic, of a particular alignment, or of a particular material for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Each time the monster gains this option, choose two from the following: adamantine, chaotic, cold iron, evil, good, lawful, magic, or silver.

Channel Destruction: Choose one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The monster's weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of the chosen type for every 4 CR the monster has.

Energy Explosion: Choose one of the following: acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic. Once per day as a standard action, the monster can create a 20-foot-radius burst of energy within 60 feet. This deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + the monster's CR of the chosen type to all creatures in the burst. A successful Reflex save halves the damage.

Energy Infusion: Choose one of the following: acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, or sonic. Each time the monster uses a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that deals energy damage, it can choose to change the energy damage type dealt by that ability to the chosen type instead.

Evil Eye: As a standard action, the monster chooses one creature within 30 feet that it can see. The target takes a -2 penalty on either ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, or to AC for 1 minute. If the target succeeds at a Will save, the effect lasts for 1 round instead.

Magic Attack: As a standard action, the monster makes a ranged touch attack against one creature within 30 feet of it. On a hit, the attack inflicts the monster's high weapon damage of one of the following types (chosen when the monster gains this option): bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, force, piercing, slashing, or sonic. For force damage, use the low damage value instead of high damage value.

Misfortune: As a standard action, the monster targets one creature within 30 feet. The next time the target attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check before the end of the monster's next turn, the target must roll twice and use the lower result.

Potent Magic Damage: Choose a spell subschool or descriptor, such as fire or phantasm. The monster's spells and spell-like abilities of the chosen type deal an additional 1 point of damage per damage die.

Sacrilegious Aura: The monster emits an aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius. The aura functions as the desecrate spell cast on an altar. In addition, any creature that attempts to use a positive energy effect in this area must succeed at a concentration check or the positive energy has no effect.

Smite: Choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful. With one attack per day, the monster can deal additional damage equal to its CR against a creature of the chosen type. The number of uses per day increases by one for every 3 CR the monster has.

Spell Combat: The monster's attacks use the low attack value, but when it makes a full attack the monster can also cast any spell it knows that has a casting time of 1 standard action.

Spell Penetration: The monster gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome a creature's spell resistance. At CR 11, the bonus increases to +4.

Spellstrike: Whenever the monster casts a spell with a range of touch, it can deliver the spell as part of a melee attack. The monster makes the melee attack in place of the spell's touch attack. On a hit, the attack deals normal damage and the spell takes effect.

Turn Undead: As a standard action, this monster forces each undead creature within 30 feet of it to attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5). On a failed saving throw, the target flees from the monster for 1 minute as if panicked. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to end the effect.

These magical benefits protect, heal, or improve the abilities of the monster or its allies.

Bolstering Touch: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to grant it a bonus equal to 1 + 1/2 the monster's CR on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round.

Channel Energy: As a standard action, the monster releases a burst of energy that affects either all living creatures or all undead creatures in a 30-foot radius. The burst either deals 1d6 points of damage (from negative energy) or heals 1d6 points of damage (from positive energy). A creature that would take damage from this effect can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to halve the damage. A monster can use this option 8 times per day. Increase the damage or healing by 1d6 per 2 CR.

Combat Casting: The monster gains a +6 bonus on concentration checks.

Countersong: The monster can attempt a Perform skill check. It and each ally within 30 feet of it can use the result of this check in place of saving throws to resist sonic, language-dependent, illusion (pattern), and illusion (figment) effects.

Fortune: As a standard action, the monster grants good luck to one creature within 30 feet of it. The next time the target attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check before the end of the monster's next turn, the target can reroll and must use the second result.

Healing Touch: As a standard action (or a swift action if it targets itself ), the monster touches itself or one living creature it can reach. The target heals 1d6 hit points of damage for every 2 CR the monster has (minimum 1d6) and removes one condition of the monster's choice. If the monster targets an undead creature, it must make a melee touch attack. On a hit, the target takes damage instead of being healed. The monster can use this option 5 times per day.

Potent Healing: Whenever the monster heals hit point damage using a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, it heals a number of additional hit points equal to its CR. This doesn't apply to dealing damage to undead using positive energy, but does apply to using negative energy to heal undead.

Protective Ward: As a standard action, the monster emits a field of protective magic that extends from it in a 10-foot radius. The monster and each allied creature in the area gains a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the monster's next turn.

Remove Major Condition: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to remove the blinded, paralyzed, or stunned condition. It can use this ability on itself as a swift action.

Remove Minor Condition: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to remove the dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition. It can use this ability on itself as a swift action.

Remove Moderate Condition: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to remove the dazed, exhausted, frightened, or nauseated condition. It can use this ability on itself as a swift action.

Transfer Hit Points: As an immediate action, the monster can transfer hit points from either itself to an ally or an ally to itself; choose one when taking this option. The number of hit points it can transfer in this way is equal to its CR + 5.

Most of these abilities grant more spellcasting abilities or reflect the monster's deep understanding or clever manipulation of magical forces.

At-Will Magic: Choose one spell of 0 or 1st level that does not heal damage. The monster can cast this spell at will.

Contingent Spell: Choose one spell of the monster's CR band or lower (see <a href="rules37a1.html?Name=Spell%20Lists&amp;Category=Step%206:%20Spells">Spell Lists</a>). This spell comes into effect on the monster under a particular condition you specify (such as "when an enemy attempts to attack the monster" or "when the monster is targeted by an enchantment spell"). This ability can trigger once per day. The spell chosen is in addition to any spells the monster gains from being a spellcaster or having the secondary magic option (see <a href="rules6c9e.html?Name=Universal%20Options&amp;Category=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options">Universal Options</a>).

Dimensional Steps: As a standard action, the monster teleports to an open space it can see within 150 feet of it.

Incorporeal Form: Once per day, this monster gains the <a href="rulesa403.html?Name=Monstrous&amp;Category=Combat%20Options">incorporeal option</a> for 1 minute.

Magical Aptitude: When attempting a Spellcraft or Use Magic Device check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Metamagic Spell: Choose one <a href="featsc9d0.html?Category=Metamagic">metamagic feat</a> and one spell the monster knows. That spell gains the benefit of the chosen metamagic feat once per day.

Mutagen: Choose one of the following benefits: <ul><li>The monster's AC, Reflex save bonus, ranged attack bonus, and Dexterity modifier each increase by 2. Its Wisdom modifier decreases by 2. </li><li>The monster's melee attack bonus, melee damage rolls, and Strength modifier each increase by 2. Its Intelligence modifier decreases by 2. </li><li>The monster's Fortitude save bonus and Constitution modifier by each increase by 2, and its hit points increase by an amount equal to double its CR. Its Charisma modifier decreases by 2.</li></ul>Spontaneous Casting: The monster can spontaneously replace its normal spells with spells of the same level of a particular type. Choose cure spells, inflict spells, summon nature's ally spells, or any type of spell that has one spell per level in a similar fashion. Spontaneously casting a spell in this way uses up the daily use of a spell. A monster must have the spellcaster array to gain this option.
