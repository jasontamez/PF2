You can attempt an Athletics check to catch yourself while falling along a wall or slope. The DC is equal to the wall's climb DC + 20 or the slope's climb DC + 10 (see Climb, below).

To catch another character that falls while within your reach, you must succeed at a melee touch attack (the target can forgo her Dexterity bonus to AC). If you hit, you then attempt an Athletics check with a DC equal to the wall's climb DC + 10. If you succeed, you catch the falling character, but if her total weight (with equipment) exceeds your heavy load limit, you fall. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't stop the character's fall but don't lose your grip. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop her fall and you begin falling as well.

Action: None.
