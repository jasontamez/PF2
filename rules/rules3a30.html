As with hills terrain, mountains come in a variety of shapes and sizes. In places where tectonic activity has for the most part stabilized and the rock is exposed to the upper air, the mountains are smoother and more eroded. In places where the earth is still relatively unstable, the mountains are harsher and more jagged and pose a greater (and more dangerous) challenge to climbers. Caves, chasms, cliff faces, and dense rubble are all common in mountains, to say nothing of the animals and monsters that make their homes in the peaks. Mountains flank strategic passes and overlook fertile valleys, which makes them common locales for fortresses and brigands.

The following sections of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook can help flesh out mountain terrain. <a href="rules3800.html?Name=Mountain%20Terrain&amp;Category=Wilderness">Mountain terrain is described here</a>. Remember the effects of high altitude on those not acclimated to it. Mountain encounters might also include rockslides or avalanches of snow, mud, or rock, low clouds that function as fog, and ice sheets. Volcanic mountains add dangers of smoke and lava.
