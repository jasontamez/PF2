Many spells can place curses on unfortunate victims. Their effects are usually simple and can be ended with the right spell (but never <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>). All curse spells have the curse descriptor. The most well-known is <a href="spelldisplay6c8d.html?ItemName=bestow%20curse">bestow curse</a>, which allows the caster to invent her own effect in line with the listed options (no worse than a 50% chance of losing actions, a -4 penalty on checks, or a -6 penalty to an ability score). Effects in line with that power level include the following, though ultimately they are limited only by the caster's imagination and the GM's discretion. <ul></ul>When the victim is adjacent to the area of a damaging spell or spell-like effect (even one he created himself ), the area expands to include the victim. </li></ul>The victim can't heal naturally, and magical healing heals the victim by only half the usual amount (minimum 1 point). The victim's fast healing and regeneration, if any, are likewise halved. </li></ul>The victim is plagued by cacophonous sounds and strobing lights that only she can hear and see. She is distracted (-5 penalty on Perception checks), cannot take 10 on skill checks, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + spell level) to successfully cast spells. Any time the victim picks up or retrieves an object (including drawing a weapon or ammunition), there is a 50% chance that she immediately drops it. If she drops ammunition while attempting to make a ranged attack, that particular attack is lost.</li></ul>

Save DCs: The stat block for a curse lists the save DC. For curses that can be created by a spell, this usually represents the minimum DC. If a spell is used to create a curse in your game, calculate the DC using the caster's ability score and the spell level as normal.



Optional Rule: Spontaneous Curses

Although spellcasters can curse targets more easily than others, in times of great emotion and the need for vengeance, other creatures can channel divine or arcane energy to create a spontaneous curse. A curse can be improvised only under great stress, whether by the deepest indignity, seething hatred, cold revenge, or as a dying act (all at the GM's discretion), though in any case, never more than once in a month. Spontaneous curses are most commonly placed upon those who violate a taboo or a sacred or unholy place. Sometimes gods or other supernatural beings curse mortals who fail tests of character or who trespass where they are not welcome.

If the GM allows a creature to place a spontaneous curse, that creature must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or (religion). Such a creature can attempt to use a curse with a listed DC less than or equal to 10 + its number of ranks in the skill. Creatures with a curse ability, as well as some creatures closely associated with curses (such as angels, fey, hags, and undead), can curse a target without meeting this requirement. Improvising a curse reduces the cursing creature's Charisma score by 2, and this decrease remains as long as the curse lasts; the cursing creature cannot dismiss its improvised curse.
