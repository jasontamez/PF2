The Pathfinder RPG styles itself as a fantasy RPG, not as a horror RPG. Horror adventures often feature unsettling content, and while many players enjoy exploring macabre places, that is not universally true. It is part of your responsibility to make sure your players know that the game will feature frightening elements and give them a sense of what themes to expect. If players express discomfort or concern, change or remove the objectionable aspects or, if necessary, invite the player to participate in a different game.

You might worry that revealing your story's themes might spoil it. Don't. This preliminary description can act more as a film's trailer, providing the players with glimpses necessary to make informed decisions about whether they'll enjoy the experience. Veiling a game's content is not worth making players feel endangered or like they've been tricked into publicly visiting dark personal places. You can't simply assume that you know what your players will be okay with. No matter how long you might have been playing with someone, nobody broadcasts his every phobia, secret fear, or private experience. So, for the comfort of everyone, make sure your players know what they're getting into.

Additionally, despite the fact that horror games include more ominous themes than other adventures, just calling something a horror game does not provide an excuse to vent your darkest thoughts without further warning. While many frightening games feature gore, menace, and tragedy, the inclusion of such elements doesn't in itself indicate to your players that scenes of torture, sexual violence, child endangerment, or other brutalities are on the table. "Grittiness" and "realism" are not excuses to surprise players with this content midgame. If a game might feature such elements, you remain responsible for making your players aware of that beforehand and letting them decide whether they want to play.

Finally, sometimes opinions and expectations simply change. Let players know that if they become uncomfortable with any part of your game, it's perfectly fine for them to leave the game space. Make yourself available to discuss your game's content if a player so desires-but understand you are not owed any insight into your players' reactions. If a player expresses concerns about a game's content, he doesn't need to explain himself; either remove the sensitive element, run a different game, or ask the player to participate in a different game. If you keep these considerations in mind and prioritize your players' enjoyment, you'll be on your way to running an adventure your group remembers for its creepiness, not its unintended negative consequences.
