Some class features function differently because of the consolidated skills list. Clarifications appear here, divided by class. These entries cover only the main class features, so the GM might need to adjudicate how certain arcane schools, domains, and the like interact with the consolidated skills system. Class features are omitted if they can be handled with a simple substitution, such as changing an ability that requires a Disable Device check to instead require a Finesse check.

Alchemist: Because the consolidated skills system removes Craft skills by default, the GM should either treat the alchemist's Craft (alchemy) bonus as though it were equal to his character level + his Intelligence modifier + 3 or use the background skills system.

Barbarian: The Acrobatics skill and the intimidate function of Influence can be used while raging.

Rage Powers: Raging climber, raging leaper, and raging swimmer are replaced with raging athlete, which adds the barbarian's level as an enhancement bonus on all Athletics checks and treats all such checks to jump as though the character had a running start.

Bard: Note that Performance applies to all types of performance, rather than being broken down like the core Perform skills. Bardic knowledge adds 1/2 the bard's class level (minimum 1) on all Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks, and the bard can attempt checks with these skills untrained. Versatile performance allows the bard to substitute Performance when attempting either Acrobatics or Influence checks. He must choose only one of these two skills, and doesn't increase the number of substituted skills at higher levels. Lore master applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks.

Bloodrager: The Acrobatics skill and the intimidate function of Influence can be used while bloodraging.

Cavalier: A cavalier order adds only one skill to the cavalier's list of class skills (of the GM's choice, but the choice can't overlap with the cavalier's normal class skills). The bonus on checks applies only to the specific skill function listed.

Druid: Nature sense instead grants a +1 bonus on Nature and Survival checks.

Hunter: The bonus from the monkey aspect applies only to Athletics checks to climb.

Inquisitor: Stern gaze grants the inquisitor a bonus on Influence checks to intimidate and on Perception checks to sense motive.

Investigator: Because the consolidated skills system removes Craft skills by default, the GM should either treat the investigator's Craft (alchemy) bonus as though it were equal to his character level + his Intelligence modifier + 3 or use the background skills system. The investigator's ability to apply inspiration without expending uses applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks (he must still be trained in the skill). The trapfinding bonus applies to both Perception checks to locate traps and Finesse checks to disable traps. An investigator can use Finesse to disable magical traps. Keen recollection applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks.

Investigator Talents: Device talent allows the investigator to use Spellcraft untrained, but has no effect if the investigator is trained in Spellcraft. Empathy applies only when the investigator uses Perception to sense motive. Expanded inspiration can be used with Perception and Survival checks. Inspirational expertise applies when the investigator identifies a monster's special powers or vulnerabilities using whichever skill is appropriate. Inspired intelligence applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks. Underworld inspiration applies to Finesse and Influence checks.

Oracle: An oracle gains two class skills from her mystery (chosen by the GM).

Ranger: The favored enemy bonus applies to Perception and Survival checks against creatures of the selected type, and to checks with the monster knowledge function of the relevant skill. The favored terrain bonus applies to initiative checks, Nature checks, Perception checks to notice things, Stealth checks, and Survival checks.

Rogue: The trapfinding bonus applies to both Perception checks to locate traps and Finesse checks to disable traps. A rogue can use Finesse to disable magical traps.

Rogue Talents: The skill mastery talent applies to a number of skills equal to 1 + 1/2 the rogue's Intelligence modifier. It can still be taken multiple times.

Skald: Note that Performance applies to all types of performance, rather than being broken down like the core Perform skills. Bardic knowledge adds 1/2 the skald's class level (minimum 1) on all Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks, and the skald can attempt checks with these skills untrained. The Acrobatics skill and the intimidate function of Influence can be used while in an inspired rage. Versatile performance allows the skald to substitute Performance when attempting either Influence checks or Perception checks to sense motive. He must choose only one of these two skills, and doesn't increase the number of skills substituted at higher levels. Lore master applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks.

Slayer: The studied target bonus applies to Influence checks to bluff, Perception checks, and Survival checks against the studied target. The stalker bonus applies to Influence checks to intimidate a creature, Perform checks to use a disguise, and Stealth checks.

Slayer Talents: Foil scrutiny applies to Influence checks to bluff a creature and Perform checks to use a disguise. Trapfinding grants Finesse as a class skill. The bonus from trapfinding applies to both Perception checks to locate traps and Finesse checks to disable traps. A slayer with trapfinding can use Finesse to disable magical traps.

Sorcerer: A bloodline's class skill applies to all uses of the corresponding consolidated skill.

Summoner: Change the eidolon's class skills to Perception and Stealth. The summoner can choose two additional class skills for the eidolon. An eidolon with a fly speed does not gain Acrobatics as a class skill.

Swashbuckler: Derring-do can be used on Acrobatics and Athletics checks. Swashbuckler's edge can be used on Acrobatics and Athletics checks.

Witch: The bonus from the flight hex is a +4 racial bonus on Athletics checks to swim.

Abilities that aren't tied only to one class appear here.

Animal Companions: Change animal skills to Acrobatics, Athletics*, Perception*, Stealth*, and Survival. An asterisk (*) indicates a class skill.

Familiars: The skill bonus from the familiar applies to all uses of the corresponding consolidated skill, but the bonus is reduced to +2. The raven familiar grants a +2 bonus on Society checks.
