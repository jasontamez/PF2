As a GM, you should know your players and their PCs, and create encounters that suit their play style and show off what their characters can do. If the fighter's player likes to jump into the middle of groups of monsters and hack away, be sure to include such encounters every so often so that player gets to do what he likes best. If he has the <a href="featdisplay2107.html?ItemName=Cleave">Cleave</a> feat, set up situations where he can cleave an adjacent foe; if he has <a href="featdisplay6bcb.html?ItemName=Great%20Cleave">Great Cleave</a>, make sure every now and then he can go cleave-crazy on a horde of weak opponents. If the sorcerer's player is a tactician and likes to use ranged spells and enchantments, put her against charm-vulnerable opponents using ranged attacks so she has perfect targets for her style of play. If the monk's player is a fan of Wuxia films and likes the extreme-cinematic style of combat, put opponents on ledges so he can use high jump, or enemies at the bottoms of cliffs so he can get there quickly using slow fall, and make sure some enemies aren't immune to stunning fist.

This means you should keep an eye on what feats and spells your players select as their PCs level up, and on what magic items you award them or they create. If the fighter takes <a href="featdisplay6bcb.html?ItemName=Great%20Cleave">Great Cleave</a> at level 5 and only gets to use it once by the time he's reached level 10, it's as if he wasted that feat choice, and that's not fun. You want the players to use the abilities that make them excited about the game. Reward them for playing well by letting their characters flex their muscles.

This is not to say that you shouldn't challenge the players to try different tactics. Put the fighter who likes being surrounded in a situation where he has to guard a narrow bridge and can't let anyone get past him, or have him fight monsters that get flanking bonuses or sneak attacks that make him rely on terrain or the other PCs to avoid getting killed. Let the tactician-sorcerer take control of a minion. The trick is to teach other styles of play (or at least present them as options) without them feeling forced.
