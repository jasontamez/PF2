Table 6-8: Monster Statistics by CR is an expansion of the table of the same name on page 291 of the Bestiary, listing approximate statistics for monsters up to CR 30 (the information for CR 1-20 is identical to that presented in the Bestiary). These values are rough guidelines. You'll notice that many of the existing monsters in this book don't follow these guidelines exactly. Most monsters excel in one of these areas (usually in the amount of damage dealt), but lag in one or two other areas to balance them out. For example, a monster might have higher damage than what's listed in the table, but have a lower AC and hit points. The entries on the table are as follows.

CR: This is the approximate CR of the monster. This number might change as the design progresses.

Hit Points: This is the approximate hit point total for the monster. A creature with a particularly high AC, especially large saving throw bonuses, or a number of resistances might have a lower number. Outsiders and constructs typically have lower hit point totals.

Armor Class: This is the average AC for a creature of this CR. When it comes time to design the creature's protections, keep this number in mind. Creatures whose hit point totals are above average typically have lower AC to compensate.

High Attack: This is the average total attack bonus for a creature of this CR that is primarily a melee or ranged combatant. Creatures with a higher than normal average damage typically have a lower attack value to compensate.

Low Attack: This is the average total attack bonus for a creature of this CR that doesn't rely upon melee or ranged attacks to deal damage. This includes most creatures that mainly use spells and spell-like abilities in combat.

Average Damage: This is the average amount of damage dealt by a creature of this CR if all of its attacks are successful. To determine a creature's average damage, add the average value for all of the damage dice rolled (as determined by Table 1-5: Average Die Results on page 293 of the Bestiary) to the damage modifier for each attack.

A creature that relies on melee or ranged weapons in combat should have average damage within the range of high and low damage.

A creature with higher than normal attack bonuses often deals less damage, and a creature with lower than normal attack bonuses often deals more damage.

Primary Ability DC: This is the average difficulty class (DC) for any spells, spell-like abilities, and special abilities (such as breath weapons) possessed by a creature of this CR that relies on such attacks in combat. If an ability is particularly powerful, it might have a lower DC to compensate for that.

Secondary Ability DC: This is the average DC for spells and special abilities for a creature that does not rely on such attacks in combat. Generally, an ability's DC should not be lower than this number.

Good Save: This is the average saving throw bonus for a creature of this CR, if the saving throw is one of the creature's good saving throws.

Poor Save: This is the average saving throw bonus for a creature of this CR, if the saving throw is one of the creature's poor saving throws.
