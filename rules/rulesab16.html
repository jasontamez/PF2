Whether by the snapping of a neck or lengthy strangulation, hanging is a time-tested form of execution, and stories abound of heroes rescuing a victim in the nick of time.

By the Rules: Being hanged kills by either breaking the victim's neck or strangling the victim. Breaking the neck implies a quick, instant death from damage, like a <a href="rules51aa.html?Name=Helpless%20Defenders&amp;Category=Combat%20Modifiers">coup de grace</a>. Getting into a noose (and the DC for escaping it) would be covered by the <a href="rules6d98.html?Name=Grapple&amp;Category=Combat%20Maneuvers">tie up aspect of the grapple rules</a>. Strangulation suggests consulting the rules for <a href="rules70f3.html?Name=Suffocation&amp;Category=Environmental%20Rules">suffocation</a>.

Extrapolation: How a PC might have wound up in a noose is up to the GM, but once he has, a few things might occur. If the execution involves a drop, the noose could deal 1d6 points of damage + 1d6 for every 5 feet he falls, to a maximum of 20d6. The victim is considered helpless, and this attack is treated as a coup de grace-requiring a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt) to avoid death. If the character has his hands free and uses them to hold on to the noose during the drop, he gains a +2 bonus on this saving throw.

Once a character has survived the drop (or if one never occurred), his time is still limited as the noose chokes him to death. As the rules for tying someone up describe, a character can bind someone, creating a situation where the DC to escape such bonds is equal to 20 + the rope-tying character's CMB. This seems like a good way to set a DC for escaping a noose. A character can attempt to escape a noose, but doing so requires that his hands be free (otherwise, he must escape from those restraints first). Once they are, he can attempt to break the noose's "grapple". While dangling from a noose, a character is helpless.

Horror Considerations: A noose quickly turns into a lifeline when the ground is hundreds of feet below a struggling victim. Nooses made of chain or metal cord might also be more difficult to escape.
