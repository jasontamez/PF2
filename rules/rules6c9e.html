A universal option can be taken in place of any option granted by an array or graft, regardless of the intended option type. These abilities are suitable for multiple arrays and roles.

Athletic: When attempting an Acrobatics, Climb, or Swim check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Flying Acumen: This monster gains hover (as the <a href="featdisplaye621.html?ItemName=Hover">monster feat</a>) and gains Fly as an additional master skill.

Magic Weapon: The monster uses a magic weapon. Choose one of the following benefits to apply to its attacks with that weapon.
Bane: +2d6 points of damage against creatures of a specified type.
Energy: +1d6 points of energy damage (choose one type).
Keen: Double critical threat range.
Returning: Weapon returns if thrown (thrown only).
Seeking: Negates miss chances (ranged only).
Vicious: +2d6 points of damage, and also deals 1d6 points of damage to the monster on a hit (melee only).

If the monster is CR 10 or higher, you can also choose from the following.
Aligned: +2d6 points of damage against creatures of a specified alignment (choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful).
Energy Burst: +1d6 points of energy damage and an additional 1d10 points of damage on a critical hit (choose one type).

To imitate a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay590b.html?ItemName=SPEED">speed</a> or <a href="magicweaponsdisplay05ea.html?ItemName=Wounding">wounding</a> weapon, use extra attack or bleed, respectively, and apply them only to attacks with the weapon.

Potions: The monster has two <a href="spelldisplaye3d6.html?ItemName=cure%20light%20wounds">potions of cure light wounds</a>, which cure 1d8+1 hit points each. At CR 5, these are <a href="spelldisplayb58c.html?ItemName=cure%20moderate%20wounds">potions of cure moderate wounds</a> healing 2d8+3 hit points, and at CR 10 they're <a href="spelldisplayccb7.html?ItemName=cure%20serious%20wounds">potions of cure serious wounds</a> healing 3d8+5 hit points.

Save Boost: Increase the monster's saving throw bonuses by 1, or increase any one of its saving throw bonuses by 3.

Secondary Magic: Though this monster isn't primarily a spellcaster, it does have several spells or spell-like abilities. Choose any <a href="rulesba5c.html?Name=Step%206:%20Spells&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">spell list</a>. The monster can use each of that list's primary spells of its CR band once per day. This ability can also be used to give a spellcaster extra spell-like abilities to fit its monster type.

Summon Allies: This monster can attempt to summon monsters of the same creature type as itself as a full-round action. Choose either a creature of the same CR as the monster (with a 35% chance of success) or a creature with a CR no greater than the monster's - 5 (with a 60% chance of success). The summoned ally returns to the place from which it came after 1 hour.

Terrain Stride: Choose a type of terrain, such as undergrowth, ice, or rubble. The monster can move through nonmagical terrain of that type without impairing its movement or taking damage.
