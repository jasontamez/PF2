Unlike a deity, a demigod is represented in game with statistics, ranging in power from CR 26 to CR 30. <a href="monsterfamilies8675.html?ItemName=Archdevil">Archdevils</a>, <a href="monsterfamilies79a6.html?ItemName=Demon%20Lord">demon lords</a>, <a href="monsterfamiliescd5b.html?ItemName=Empyreal%20Lord">empyreal lords</a>, and <a href="monsterfamilies287c.html?ItemName=Great%20Old%20One">Great Old Ones</a> are all examples of demigods. A demigod who controls a planar realm can effect physical change in that realm by thought, but such changes are not instantaneous. Beyond the reach of its realm, a demigod must rely upon its own abilities and magic to effect such changes.

Demigods grant their clerics access to four domains.
