The overarching structure by which individual planes are connected to each other can take any form. Below are merely a few suggestions. <ul><li>Nested spheres or shells, with each plane a new onionlike layer. </li><li>A great wheel with planes linked to form the rim or emerging from the central hub of the Material Plane like spokes. </li><li>A mobius strip connecting all the planes, similar to the great wheel, save that the mobius strip may be twisted to bring distant planes closer together. </li><li>A world-tree whose roots and branches provide conduits between worlds. </li><li>Islands in an ocean of chaos, or mountaintops poking above the clouds, beneath which lies the underworld. </li><li>A living creature, with the planes forming its limbs or carried on its back.</li></ul>
