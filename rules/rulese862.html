Keeping track of wound thresholds for a horde of monsters can be a significant amount of work. To simplify the process, the GM can use only the wounded threshold and ignore the increased range for the disabled condition. This means she only needs to keep track of 1/2 of each monster's hit points and the -2 penalty. The GM should use this method primarily for large groups of monsters; prominent NPCs and enemies that fight on their own should use all the thresholds.
