Madnesses are formatted in the same way as other <a href="rules4e26.html?Name=Afflictions&amp;Category=Special%20Abilities">afflictions</a>, with the following changes.

Save: Unless the character has gained the madness via the <a href="rules0b4f.html?Name=Sanity&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">sanity system</a>, this is the save necessary to avoid contracting the madness. It is also the base saving throw needed to cure the madness (see <a href="rules239c.html?Name=Curing%20Madness&amp;Category=Madness">Curing Madness</a> below) and the saving throw the effects of the madness require. If, during the course of treating a madness, the affliction's DC decreases, that new reduced saving throw also becomes the DC the afflicted character must succeed at to avoid any of the madness's effects. It's possible to suffer from multiple forms of the same madness. If a character becomes afflicted with a form of madness from which he is already suffering (even if it takes a slightly different form, such as phobias of different objects), the current DC of that madness increases by 5. All madnesses are mind-affecting effects.

Onset: When a character suffers madness from the sanity system (due to a sanity attack that deals sanity damage greater than or equal to his sanity edge), this onset time does not apply. Use this entry only when the character contracts the madness in other ways. During the onset time, the character gradually gains the madness effect, rather then suddenly experiencing the full effect after a number of days.

Effect: This is the effect of the madness. An afflicted character typically suffers this effect at all times, but some madnesses manifest only during certain situations. For complex effects or effects that rely on roleplaying, the description section of the madness contains a more detailed description of the effect. If you're using the sanity system, this effect manifests as long as the madness is not dormant.

Dormancy Effect: If you're using the sanity system, the afflicted character suffers this effect while the madness is dormant. Otherwise, ignore this entry.
