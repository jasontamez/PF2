Healthy-Weakened-Impaired-Disabled-Unconscious-Dead



Weakened: A character whose health is weakened by Constitution poison takes a -2 penalty on all Fortitude saves and Constitution checks. Every time she attempts a Fortitude save against the poison, whether she succeeds or fails, she takes damage as on initial exposure.

Impaired: A character impaired by Constitution poison takes an additional -2 penalty on the above checks.

Disabled: A character disabled by Constitution poison gains the disabled condition. If she takes a standard action, her hit points drop by 1 or to -1, whichever is worse.

Unconscious: A character rendered unconscious by Constitution poison enters a state of shock and can't be woken by any means as long as she remains in this state.

Dead: The character's immune system is ravaged by the poison, and she expires.
