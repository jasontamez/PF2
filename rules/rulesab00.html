These magical benefits protect, heal, or improve the abilities of the monster or its allies.

Bolstering Touch: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to grant it a bonus equal to 1 + 1/2 the monster's CR on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 round.

Channel Energy: As a standard action, the monster releases a burst of energy that affects either all living creatures or all undead creatures in a 30-foot radius. The burst either deals 1d6 points of damage (from negative energy) or heals 1d6 points of damage (from positive energy). A creature that would take damage from this effect can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) to halve the damage. A monster can use this option 8 times per day. Increase the damage or healing by 1d6 per 2 CR.

Combat Casting: The monster gains a +6 bonus on concentration checks.

Countersong: The monster can attempt a Perform skill check. It and each ally within 30 feet of it can use the result of this check in place of saving throws to resist sonic, language-dependent, illusion (pattern), and illusion (figment) effects.

Fortune: As a standard action, the monster grants good luck to one creature within 30 feet of it. The next time the target attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check before the end of the monster's next turn, the target can reroll and must use the second result.

Healing Touch: As a standard action (or a swift action if it targets itself ), the monster touches itself or one living creature it can reach. The target heals 1d6 hit points of damage for every 2 CR the monster has (minimum 1d6) and removes one condition of the monster's choice. If the monster targets an undead creature, it must make a melee touch attack. On a hit, the target takes damage instead of being healed. The monster can use this option 5 times per day.

Potent Healing: Whenever the monster heals hit point damage using a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, it heals a number of additional hit points equal to its CR. This doesn't apply to dealing damage to undead using positive energy, but does apply to using negative energy to heal undead.

Protective Ward: As a standard action, the monster emits a field of protective magic that extends from it in a 10-foot radius. The monster and each allied creature in the area gains a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the monster's next turn.

Remove Major Condition: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to remove the blinded, paralyzed, or stunned condition. It can use this ability on itself as a swift action.

Remove Minor Condition: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to remove the dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition. It can use this ability on itself as a swift action.

Remove Moderate Condition: As a standard action, the monster can touch a creature to remove the dazed, exhausted, frightened, or nauseated condition. It can use this ability on itself as a swift action.

Transfer Hit Points: As an immediate action, the monster can transfer hit points from either itself to an ally or an ally to itself; choose one when taking this option. The number of hit points it can transfer in this way is equal to its CR + 5.
