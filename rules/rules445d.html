There are many ways a spellcaster can become afflicted with a spellblight. These conditions can be gained by way of a <a href="spelldisplay6c8d.html?ItemName=bestow%20curse">bestow curse</a> or <a href="spelldisplay1daa.html?ItemName=major%20curse">major curse</a> spell, as well as spontaneously with a number of unusual circumstances, many of which are detailed below.

Areas of Spellblight: Typically, the act of casting a spell has little chance of inflicting a spellblight, but there are some areas of magical instability where the mere act of casting a spell within the area can endanger a spellcaster. There are two main types of spellblight areas. In areas of minor spellblight, each time a spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be affected by a random minor spellblight. In areas of major spellblight, the caster must succeed at a DC 22 saving throw or contract a major spellblight. Due to the strange and random nature of such areas, their effects are not always consistent. There are areas that inflict a single type of spellblight, and areas that are easier or harder to resist with each spell cast.

Curses and Other Spells: All spellblights can be inflicted upon spellcasters with a bestow curse or <a href="spelldisplay1daa.html?ItemName=major%20curse">major curse</a> spell. Bestow curse can bestow any minor spellblight, while a major curse is required to afflict a spellcaster with a major spellblight. Other spells may inflict a specific spellblight or may allow the caster to select any spellblight as part of the spell. A successful saving throw against the spell prevents the spellblight from taking hold.
