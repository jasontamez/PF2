The steps listed below present all the information you need to generate territories for your PCs to explore. If you're using the hex-based exploration rules from Ultimate Campaign, follow these steps for every hex in your map, though you can reuse information for similar hexes.

The first step is to determine your territory's Challenge Rating. Typically, this should be the same value as the PCs' Average Party Level, but you might want to make it easier or harder for the sake of the story. The territory's CR helps guide the creation of random encounters, but it also determines the base DC of exploration checks, which can be found on Table 4-1. Though most exploration checks use the Survival skill, you can assign a different skill for particularly unusual or magical territories (for example, exploring a complex extraplanar library might require a Knowledge check, while exploring the mindscape of a slumbering god in which the PCs are trapped could require a Sense Motive check).

Exploration check DCs are intended to be moderately difficult. Characters who are heavily invested in the relevant skill for a given check should have a reasonable chance of success, while those who are not adept with the necessary skills are in danger of leading the PCs off track by providing erroneous information or misinterpreting way signs. Often, characters who lack the relevant skills for a particular exploration are better off using their abilities for other tasks or helping more skillful PCs via the aid another action.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 126</a>
As a general rule, each territory should contain at least one location to discover; otherwise there's little point to exploring a territory. In some cases, you need to design only a single location-the focus and eventual goal of the exploration. Other times, such as if the PCs are surveying a lost world or another terra incognita, you'll want to design multiple locations, each competing with the others for the PCs' attention.

Each location should be something memorable and significant. Finding a location should grant a reward (such as a supernatural enhancement, valuable treasure, or a way sign), or that location should be an adventure site. Locations can be as simple as a stash of ancient pirate treasure or as complex as a lost city harboring ancient magic and technological mysteries.

Each location in a territory needs its own discovery score. An obvious location (such as a large castle or a humanoid army camp) should have an initial discovery score of 3, while a more obscure location (such as a single house or a cave entrance) should have an initial discovery score of 6. You can modify this initial discovery score total using the values given on Table 4-2, but feel free to come up with your own values based on the exploration's narrative.



Table 4-2: Discovery Score Modifier

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Condition</td><td>Modifier to Discovery Score</td></tr><tr><td>Desert or plains terrain</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Forest, hills, or marsh terrain</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Mountain terrain</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Location is traveled to or from often</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>Location is mobile within the territory</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Location is unusually large</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Location is unusually small</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Location is deliberately hidden</td><td>+2 to +6</td></tr> </table> - Adjustments are cumulative, but the minimum discovery score = 1.

Way signs provide information about the territory and, if correctly interpreted, can provide bonus Discovery Points. A way sign could be as simple as a vantage point that offers a glimpse of a location from a distance or a hidden path toward a sought-after goal, or it might itself be a reward for finding a location. Way signs can even be earned or uncovered in advance of exploring a region-if a PC researches the territory the party intends to explore in a library, she might uncover a set of old maps or a traveler's journal that provides clues to navigating the territory and thus serves as a way sign.

When designing a territory, you'll usually want to include at least one or two way signs, or as many as 10 in cases of large territories. If you're using hex-based exploration, treat each significant terrain feature as a territory for the purpose of deciding how many way signs to include, rather than treating each hex as its own territory. Each way sign should have a trigger that results in its discovery by the party, be it attempting to recall lore about a region, gathering information in a nearby settlement, using flight to scout the lay of the land, or uncovering an old map or journal discussing the region. Each way sign should also have an associated skill check and DC to successfully gain information or interpret the clue. For a simple way sign, this DC should equal the territory's CR + 10. For a moderately complex way sign, the DC should be equal to the territory's CR + 15. For complex way signs, the DC should be equal to the territory's CR + 20.

<a href="rules370b.html?Name=Step%204:%20Create%20Random%20Encounter%20Tables&amp;Category=Creating%20a%20Territory">Step 4: Create Random Encounter Tables</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 127</a>
A territory's CR sets the average CR of random encounters occurring within that territory. Numerous example encounter tables appear on pages 324-327 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, as well as throughout Chapter 7 of Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide, but your encounter tables don't need to be as complex. Usually, a short table of a half dozen or so potential encounters is enough. It's generally best to check for encounters four times per day-once at dawn, once at noon, once at dusk, and once at midnight, with a 20% chance of an encounter each time. You can even tie encounters to exploration checks, with a result of a natural 1 on such a check indicating a random encounter. Feel free to adjust the frequency of these checks and the chance of a random encounter occurring as best suits your game. Keep in mind that too many random encounters and wandering monsters can slow down the progression of your plot and can frustrate players. It's often best to limit random encounters to one per day of in-game time.
