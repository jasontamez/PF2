Performing a minor feat of legerdemain or palming a coin-sized, unattended object requires a successful DC 10 Finesse check. If you're under close observation, the observer notices your action if it succeeds at an opposed Perception check against your Finesse check.

Action: Standard, or move at a -20 penalty.

Try Again: Yes, but a second attempt against the same target increases the DC by 10.
