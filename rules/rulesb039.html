The GM is telling a story and wants to include you in it. Consider including one or more of the following aspects and let your GM know so she can work them into her stories.

Have a Goal: Strive to be the best at something, to create something, to see a place, to get married, or to achieve some other goal. Whatever it is, have something you want above all other things.

Have a Reputation: Maybe you're a great juggler, or maybe you slipped on the stairs in front of the whole town. Whatever it is, it's something locals remember about you.

Have a Friend: Whether a friend from school, a coworker, an army buddy, or someone you saved, have someone you're close to and whom you wish well.

Have a Home: It might be a neighborhood you love, your parent's house, or a room you rent; in any case, it's the place you call home.

Have a Signature Item: A signature item is something that is recognizably yours, be it a weapon with a distinctive grip, a piece of jewelry, a lucky charm, or your favorite scarf.

Have a Problem: Maybe you don't have any money, a member of your family is sick, or you're trying to get home. Whatever the issue is, you're doing your best to solve it.

Have a Secret: Maybe you can't read, left your crewmates to die, or made your long-lost sister run away. This should be something that would embarrass or endanger you if others found out.

Have a Reason to Be Brave: Maybe it's to be like your hero, maybe it's to repay a debt, maybe it's for your child, but have a reason to occasionally face your fears.
