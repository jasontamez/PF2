This use of Survival functions as the <a href="skillsda83.html?ItemName=Heal">Heal core skill</a>.

Action: Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending to a creature that has been wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell requires 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds requires 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.

Try Again: Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try to tend wounds and ailments without witnessing proof of the original check's failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid if the target is still alive.
