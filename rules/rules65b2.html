Quirks are oddities that make an item unusual in a way that's generally neither positive nor negative, or may be a little of both. The more beneficial or double-edged quirks are higher on the following table. Feel free to invent your own quirks or apply an appropriate quirk without rolling.

Aberrant: The item has eyes, maws, and tentacles, though this has no additional effect.

Bass: The bearer's voice deepens an octave.

Bloodthirsty: The item shakes slightly whenever blood is spilled within 20 feet of it.

Color-Altering: The color of the bearer's eyes, hair, or skin changes when she carries or wears the item.

Convergent: The item is connected to another plane, bringing its bearer into telepathic contact with an otherworldly entity. The entity can communicate with the bearer to serve its own ends. Choose an appropriate entity or choose randomly from among outsider subtypes. The entity shouldn't be a being that can cause harm to the bearer through telepathic contact, such as a <a href="monsterdisplaya812.html?ItemName=Star-Spawn%20of%20Cthulhu">star-spawn of Cthulhu</a>.

Decorous: The item activates only if the user says "please" and ceases function for 1 hour if the user doesn't thank it afterward.

Dirty: The item is always covered in dirt or mud, no matter how often it is washed or cleaned.

Flaw: Roll on the table of flaws instead.

Giant-Eared: The item's bearer's ears increase to five times their original length.

Glittering: The item leaves a trail of glowing, magical motes as it moves. They dissipate after 1 round. This effect can be activated or deactivated with a command word.

Infested: The item is infested with vermin or other Fine creatures that do not interfere with its operation or harm the bearer.

Junky: The item looks extremely old, worn, rusted, or otherwise of low quality, hiding its true power.

Levitating: This item always floats slightly above the ground when laid down, dropped, or otherwise unattended.

Loyal: The item offers a perk (determined randomly upon creation) when used by one of its creators, but it presents a flaw (determined randomly upon creation) for all other users.

Magnificent: The item looks extremely powerful and valuable, even if it isn't.

Molting: Scaled skin covers this item, and the item occasionally sheds the skin and grows a new one.

Mood Coloration: The item changes colors to reflect the mood of the bearer. Each item has its own mapping of colors to emotions, but someone with knowledge of the item's quirk and its mapping who can see the color change gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Sense Motive checks against the bearer.

Noisy: The item makes an odd though not particularly loud noise when in use, such as a mace that squeaks when it's swung.

Nose-Enlarging: The bearer's nose becomes five times longer than usual.

Perk: Roll on the table of perks instead.

Racially Attuned: The item's bearer counts as the race of one of the item's creators (determined randomly upon creation) as well as her own.

Slimy: The item is covered in putrid slime, which seeps out to cover the bearer as well. The bearer gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks, on combat maneuver checks to break grapples, and to CMD against grapples (these bonuses do not stack with grease or other similar effects), but takes a -2 penalty on Acrobatics, Disable Device, and Disguise checks, as well as on Diplomacy and Handle Animal checks except against creatures that aren't bothered by putrid slime.

Soprano: The bearer's voice rises by an octave.

Spiritbound: The item's reality is imprinted onto its intended owner (creator's choice), such that the item simply doesn't exist outside of that owner's possession. The item can't be lost or stolen, and it also can't be sold or transferred.

Unpredictable: When activating the item, roll 1d6. On a 1 or 2, the DC and caster level of all the item's effects are treated as 1 lower for this activation; on a 3 or 4, there is no adjustment; and on a 5 or 6, the DC and caster level of all the item's effects are treated as 1 higher for this activation. If this puts the item below the minimum caster level for the intended effect, the activation fails but any charge or daily use is still consumed.

Unusually Colored: The item is an odd color for an item of its type, such as a sword that is bright pink.

Verdant: Leaves, moss, and vines cover the item, and leaves sprout from the targets of the item's effects.

Wet: The item and bearer are constantly soaking wet. This imposes a -1 penalty on saves against environmental cold, cold effects, and electricity effects, but grants a +1 bonus on saves against environmental heat, fire effects, and catching on fire.
