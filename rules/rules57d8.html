If your monster isn't Medium, apply a size graft. Because there are many other ways to alter a creature's AC, hit points, attack bonuses, and damage, these grafts don't adjust those values like size changes do in the core rules. Most headers list a minimum CR or maximum CR, as described in the previous step. Use caution if your monster is outside the minimum or maximum CR range. Touch and flat-footed AC never increase above the monster's total AC, and never decrease below 1.
