Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 54</a>
The skills in the Core Rulebook allow for complex specialization. In some games, the GM might wish to use a smaller list to make characters more broadly talented, to group skills that characters typically choose together, and to speed up the leveling-up process. The consolidated skills system reduces the number of skills by combining related skills. In many cases, the new skills have been renamed to highlight the nature of the consolidated skill. This variant system makes each skill rank matter more. Even after reducing the number of skill ranks granted, characters will be somewhat more skilled. Character classes that are highly skilled, such as the bard or rogue, get the biggest boost.

The consolidated skills system reduces the number of skills from 35 to 12. Many knowledge skills have been placed into larger categories with a similar theme. Knowledge (arcana), for example, is combined with Use Magic Device under Spellcraft. The list of new skills appears on Table 2-1: Consolidated Skills, along with the key ability for each consolidated skill and the core skills it replaces. Several skills are removed and not replicated by this system, as indicated by a dash (-) on Table 2-2: Converting Core Skills. These are typically skills that are less important for adventuring, but can be put back into your game using the <a href="rules11e9.html?Name=Background%20Skills&amp;Category=Pathfinder%20Unchained">background skills variant</a>. Skills can be converted to and from the consolidated skills system using Table 2-2. This is most helpful when running published adventures or using monsters built using the core system.

<a href="rulesa298.html?Name=Skill%20Descriptions&amp;Category=Consolidated%20Skills">Skill Descriptions</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 54</a>
This section describes each consolidated skill, its functions in the game, and a list of the core skills it replaces. Use these descriptions instead of those in the Core Rulebook, though many of the entries refer back to the skill descriptions on pages 87-109 of that book for more detailed explanations. Each skill listed below is broken down into its different functions, each of which is described in further detail. These details list the action needed to use the skill function, whether you can try again after a failed check, special benefits that apply to the function, and special circumstances that affect whether you can use that function untrained.



Monster Identification

You can use certain skills to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Monster Rarity</td><td>Skill Check DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Common (<a href="monsterdisplay7cda.html?ItemName=Goblin">goblin</a>)</td><td>5 + monster's CR</td></tr> <tr><td>Most monsters</td><td>10 + monster's CR</td></tr> <tr><td>Rare (<a href="monsterdisplay0340.html?ItemName=Tarrasque">tarrasque</a>)</td><td>15 + monster's CR</td></tr> </table>

The list of creature types below indicates which skill to use for each monster type.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Creature Type</td><td>Skill</td></tr> <tr><td>Aberration</td><td>Nature</td></tr> <tr><td>Animal</td><td>Nature</td></tr> <tr><td>Construct</td><td>Spellcraft</td></tr> <tr><td>Dragon</td><td>Spellcraft</td></tr> <tr><td>Fey</td><td>Nature</td></tr> <tr><td>Humanoid</td><td>Society</td></tr> <tr><td>Magical Beast</td><td>Spellcraft</td></tr> <tr><td>Monstrous humanoid</td><td>Nature</td></tr> <tr><td>Ooze</td><td>Nature</td></tr> <tr><td>Outsider</td><td>Religion</td></tr> <tr><td>Plant</td><td>Nature</td></tr> <tr><td>Undead</td><td>Religion</td></tr> <tr><td>Vermin</td><td>Nature</td></tr> </table>

Action: None.



Recall Knowledge

Some skills have the recall knowledge function. This lets you answer questions about the subjects in question. This has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).

Action: Usually none. Using a library (see Untrained, below) takes 1d4 hours.

Untrained: You can't attempt an untrained knowledge check with a DC higher than 10 unless you have access to an extensive library on the subject.

<a href="rules9472.html?Name=Acrobatics%20(Dex;%20Armor%20Check%20Penalty)&amp;Category=Consolidated%20Skills">Acrobatics (Dex; Armor Check Penalty)</a>

Functions: Balance, escape from restraints, execute flying maneuvers, ride mounts, soften falls, squeeze, tumble.

Core Skills: Acrobatics (except jumping), Escape Artist, Fly, Ride.

Acrobatics Modifiers: The circumstances listed on the table below apply modifiers to Acrobatics check DCs. Although modifiers from different categories (such as slippery, sloped, etc.) stack with each other, only the most severe modifier from each particular category applies.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Acrobatics Circumstance</td><td>Acrobatics DC Modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Slightly obstructed (gravel, sand)</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Severely obstructed (cavern, rubble)</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Slightly slippery (wet)</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Severely slippery (icy)</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Slightly sloped (<45??)</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Severely sloped (>45??)</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Slightly unsteady (boat in rough water)</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Moderately unsteady (boat in a storm)</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Severely unsteady (earthquake)</td><td>+10</td></tr> </table>

Special: If you have 3 or more ranks in Acrobatics, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2, and a +6 dodge bonus to AC when taking the total defense action instead of the usual +4.

<a href="rulesa1cd.html?Name=Athletics%20(Str;%20Armor%20Check%20Penalty)&amp;Category=Consolidated%20Skills">Athletics (Str; Armor Check Penalty)</a>

The bonus from class skills functions the same way under this system, and provides the same +3 bonus. However, the class skill lists change, with the following entries replacing the normal class skills lists. The number in parentheses indicates the number of skill ranks a character of this class gains at each level.

To adjust the rest of the system, use the guidelines below. Generally, an ability or effect that would normally grant a bonus on multiple types of skill checks instead grants a bonus on half as many, rounded down (minimum 1).

Feats that give bonuses on skill checks need to be adjusted or removed in the consolidated skills system. This section presents a list of the skill feats in the Core Rulebook that shouldn't be used with this system. It also presents an alternative version of <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus</a> that replaces the core version to make its power level work better with this system. If an ability or class feature would grant access to one of the banned feats, use the most appropriate Skill Focus feat instead, as determined by the GM. For example, a familiar that grants <a href="featdisplayb423.html?ItemName=Alertness">Alertness</a> would instead grant <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Perception)</a>. For feats that modify skills in other ways, see the <a href="rules8bc9.html?Name=Bonuses%20for%20Function&amp;Category=Altering%20Skill%20Bonuses">Bonuses for Function</a> section.

Skill Focus

Choose a skill. You are particularly adept at that skill.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all checks involving the chosen skill. If you have 10 or more ranks in that skill, this bonus increases to +4.

Many traits offer a +1 trait bonus on core skill checks and make those skills class skills. With the consolidated skills system, those traits instead grant a +1 trait bonus on traits involving the functions of those consolidated skills corresponding to the traits' listed core skills, or a +4 trait bonus if the skills are not class skills. If you later receive that skill as a class skill, this trait bonus reduces to +1.

Some class features function differently because of the consolidated skills list. Clarifications appear here, divided by class. These entries cover only the main class features, so the GM might need to adjudicate how certain arcane schools, domains, and the like interact with the consolidated skills system. Class features are omitted if they can be handled with a simple substitution, such as changing an ability that requires a Disable Device check to instead require a Finesse check.

Alchemist: Because the consolidated skills system removes Craft skills by default, the GM should either treat the alchemist's Craft (alchemy) bonus as though it were equal to his character level + his Intelligence modifier + 3 or use the background skills system.

Barbarian: The Acrobatics skill and the intimidate function of Influence can be used while raging.

Rage Powers: Raging climber, raging leaper, and raging swimmer are replaced with raging athlete, which adds the barbarian's level as an enhancement bonus on all Athletics checks and treats all such checks to jump as though the character had a running start.

Bard: Note that Performance applies to all types of performance, rather than being broken down like the core Perform skills. Bardic knowledge adds 1/2 the bard's class level (minimum 1) on all Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks, and the bard can attempt checks with these skills untrained. Versatile performance allows the bard to substitute Performance when attempting either Acrobatics or Influence checks. He must choose only one of these two skills, and doesn't increase the number of substituted skills at higher levels. Lore master applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks.

Bloodrager: The Acrobatics skill and the intimidate function of Influence can be used while bloodraging.

Cavalier: A cavalier order adds only one skill to the cavalier's list of class skills (of the GM's choice, but the choice can't overlap with the cavalier's normal class skills). The bonus on checks applies only to the specific skill function listed.

Druid: Nature sense instead grants a +1 bonus on Nature and Survival checks.

Hunter: The bonus from the monkey aspect applies only to Athletics checks to climb.

Inquisitor: Stern gaze grants the inquisitor a bonus on Influence checks to intimidate and on Perception checks to sense motive.

Investigator: Because the consolidated skills system removes Craft skills by default, the GM should either treat the investigator's Craft (alchemy) bonus as though it were equal to his character level + his Intelligence modifier + 3 or use the background skills system. The investigator's ability to apply inspiration without expending uses applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks (he must still be trained in the skill). The trapfinding bonus applies to both Perception checks to locate traps and Finesse checks to disable traps. An investigator can use Finesse to disable magical traps. Keen recollection applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks.

Investigator Talents: Device talent allows the investigator to use Spellcraft untrained, but has no effect if the investigator is trained in Spellcraft. Empathy applies only when the investigator uses Perception to sense motive. Expanded inspiration can be used with Perception and Survival checks. Inspirational expertise applies when the investigator identifies a monster's special powers or vulnerabilities using whichever skill is appropriate. Inspired intelligence applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks. Underworld inspiration applies to Finesse and Influence checks.

Oracle: An oracle gains two class skills from her mystery (chosen by the GM).

Ranger: The favored enemy bonus applies to Perception and Survival checks against creatures of the selected type, and to checks with the monster knowledge function of the relevant skill. The favored terrain bonus applies to initiative checks, Nature checks, Perception checks to notice things, Stealth checks, and Survival checks.

Rogue: The trapfinding bonus applies to both Perception checks to locate traps and Finesse checks to disable traps. A rogue can use Finesse to disable magical traps.

Rogue Talents: The skill mastery talent applies to a number of skills equal to 1 + 1/2 the rogue's Intelligence modifier. It can still be taken multiple times.

Skald: Note that Performance applies to all types of performance, rather than being broken down like the core Perform skills. Bardic knowledge adds 1/2 the skald's class level (minimum 1) on all Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks, and the skald can attempt checks with these skills untrained. The Acrobatics skill and the intimidate function of Influence can be used while in an inspired rage. Versatile performance allows the skald to substitute Performance when attempting either Influence checks or Perception checks to sense motive. He must choose only one of these two skills, and doesn't increase the number of skills substituted at higher levels. Lore master applies to Nature, Religion, Society, and Spellcraft checks.

Slayer: The studied target bonus applies to Influence checks to bluff, Perception checks, and Survival checks against the studied target. The stalker bonus applies to Influence checks to intimidate a creature, Perform checks to use a disguise, and Stealth checks.

Slayer Talents: Foil scrutiny applies to Influence checks to bluff a creature and Perform checks to use a disguise. Trapfinding grants Finesse as a class skill. The bonus from trapfinding applies to both Perception checks to locate traps and Finesse checks to disable traps. A slayer with trapfinding can use Finesse to disable magical traps.

Sorcerer: A bloodline's class skill applies to all uses of the corresponding consolidated skill.

Summoner: Change the eidolon's class skills to Perception and Stealth. The summoner can choose two additional class skills for the eidolon. An eidolon with a fly speed does not gain Acrobatics as a class skill.

Swashbuckler: Derring-do can be used on Acrobatics and Athletics checks. Swashbuckler's edge can be used on Acrobatics and Athletics checks.

Witch: The bonus from the flight hex is a +4 racial bonus on Athletics checks to swim.
