The might of magic is a great force of change and power, and most adventuring parties count one or more spellcasters among them. Since spells cover an incredible range of possibility, defining "wilderness spells" is a broad subject. In this section, spells accessible to nature-themed classes such as druids and rangers receive special attention. Spells that assist in navigating the less settled regions of the world and those that manipulate weather or terrain are also explored in greater detail.



Intrigue in the Wild

Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue features a section called <a href="rules8b1e.html?Name=Spells%20of%20Intrigue&amp;Category=Mastering%20Intrigue">Spells of Intrigue</a>. Applications of several intrigue-themed spells listed in Ultimate Intrigue are also appropriate for wilderness campaigns. In order to focus on spells more specific to wilderness adventuring, this book purposefully avoids spells that were already covered in Ultimate Intrigue. Intrigue-themed spells that are particularly appropriate for wilderness-heavy campaigns but were covered in Ultimate Intrigue include the following: <a href="spelldisplayb3a1.html?ItemName=blood%20biography">blood biography</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4873.html?ItemName=commune%20with%20nature">commune with nature</a>, <a href="spelldisplay903a.html?ItemName=create%20treasure%20map">create treasure map</a>, <a href="spelldisplay56c3.html?ItemName=detect%20poison">detect poison</a>, <a href="spelldisplayb825.html?ItemName=find%20the%20path">find the path</a>, <a href="spelldisplay2fc4.html?ItemName=locate%20creature">locate creature</a>, <a href="spelldisplay8821.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20animals">speak with animals</a>, <a href="spelldisplay3ee7.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20plants">speak with plants</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayea0c.html?ItemName=stone%20tell">stone tell</a>.

Many wilderness-appropriate spells are available as early as 1st level. These low-level spells are often disregarded, as many of them can be substituted with class abilities, equipment, and skills. Still, low-level spells (those of 3rd level and lower) can remain useful at high levels, especially because highlevel characters can cast them far more frequently.

<a href="rules628c.html?Name=Mid-Level%20Play%20(Levels%207%e2%80%9312)&amp;Category=Spells%20of%20the%20Wild">Mid-Level Play (Levels 7-12)</a>

At the middle tier of spellcasting, many spells with wilderness themes revolve around control effects. While most of them have been previously detailed in Ultimate Intrigue (see <a href="rules8b1e.html?Name=Spells%20of%20Intrigue&amp;Category=Mastering%20Intrigue">Spells of Intrigue</a> and thus are not covered below, mid-level divination spells are plentiful.

<a href="rules268d.html?Name=High-Level%20Play%20(Level%2013)&amp;Category=Spells%20of%20the%20Wild">High-Level Play (Level 13+)</a>

The most powerful of wilderness spells are few but incredibly varied. Some allow for the creation of powerful allies, while others have drastic effects over vast swaths of land.

<a href="spelldisplay32a9.html?ItemName=Animate%20Plants">Animate Plants</a>: From the lowest level that a druid gains access to this spell, she can animate four Large plants or a single Gargantuan plant. Animated plants are simple to command and act as allies and distractions in combat. The alternative entangle effect of this spell is particularly useful, as it not only bypasses spell resistance but also acts as a 7th-level spell version of <a href="spelldisplaye879.html?ItemName=entangle">entangle</a> that lasts for hours.

<a href="spelldisplay6e1e.html?ItemName=Changestaff">Changestaff</a>: While <a href="spelldisplayb541.html?ItemName=animate%20plants">animate plants</a> creates a potential host of animated plants, <a href="spelldisplay2502.html?ItemName=changestaff">changestaff</a> creates a single powerful <a href="monsterdisplayb378.html?ItemName=Treant">treant</a>-like ally that, barring misadventure, lasts for hours. The treant created by this spell is particularly useful in demolishing objects and structures. The transformed treant's innate rock throwing ability, teamed with its ability to ignore the hardness of structures, makes it particularly effective in laying siege to fortifications in all manner of terrains.

<a href="spelldisplayd0ec.html?ItemName=Control%20Plants">Control Plants</a>: As this is a transmutation spell, it bypasses a plant's normal immunity to mind-affecting effects. A plant creature can attempt a Will save to avoid being controlled, but the spell is not subject to spell resistance and has no shared-language requirement. As this spell lasts only a few minutes and doesn't allow for self-destructive commands, it's best employed as an equalizer when fighting multiple plant foes, enemies that have animated plants of their own, or foes that are plants (such as high-level <a href="racesdisplaya15c.html?ItemName=Ghoran">ghorans</a> or <a href="racesdisplay427d.html?ItemName=Vine%20Leshy">leshys</a>).

<a href="spelldisplay1f03.html?ItemName=Earthquake">Earthquake</a>: Numerous different environment-dependent effects make <a href="spelldisplaye39c.html?ItemName=earthquake">earthquake</a> an appropriate spell for wilderness-themed campaigns. The effect of this spell in caves is a true killer, as the rules for being trapped in rubble are exceptionally deadly to creatures that do not have high Strength scores or teleportation magic. Many of the aboveground effects have the potential to create rents in the earth that can trap opponents or seal away disarmed objects and other items. Regardless of its application, <a href="spelldisplaye39c.html?ItemName=earthquake">earthquake</a> is often about sending a message to a foe-the dramatic sights created by this spell capable of awing even those familiar with magic.

<a href="spelldisplay57ad.html?ItemName=Storm%20of%20Vengeance">Storm of Vengeance</a>: A supernatural representation of nature's ire, <a href="spelldisplayf5cb-2.html?ItemName=storm%20of%20vengeance">storm of vengeance</a> is a powerful evocation that blankets a wide area in a growing tempest. Though the effects of the storm are potent, there are many things to consider when employing the spell. First, it requires concentration over several rounds to build up its power, which can be difficult to maintain while the caster is engaged in combat, especially since several of the effects of the storm cause damage, such as acid rain and hailstorm. As a result, the ideal application of <a href="spelldisplayf5cb-2.html?ItemName=storm%20of%20vengeance">storm of vengeance</a> is from long range, with the caster far outside the storm's effects.

<a href="spelldisplay5871.html?ItemName=Transmute%20Metal%20to%20Wood">Transmute Metal to Wood</a>: An instantaneous effect, <a href="spelldisplay3d95.html?ItemName=transmute%20metal%20to%20wood">transmute metal to wood</a> affects all metal items within a large radius. While the spell doesn't allow any sort of saving throw, it does treat magic items affected by the spell as if they had significant spell resistance, meaning <a href="featdisplayd0d6.html?ItemName=Spell%20Penetration">Spell Penetration</a> and <a href="featdisplayae77.html?ItemName=Greater%20Spell%20Penetration">Greater Spell Penetration</a> increase the effectiveness of the spell by a wide margin. This spell also specifies that it affects only objects'so no using it against <a href="monsterdisplay63d5.html?ItemName=Iron%20Golem">iron golems</a>! <a href="spelldisplayf548.html?ItemName=Transmute%20metal%20to%20wood">Transmute metal to wood</a> is at its best when employed by <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">druids</a>, as a druid often has few (if any) metal items in her possession, allowing the caster to center the spell on herself if threatened by numerous metal-clad foes. Teaming this spell with the <a href="spelldisplayfea5.html?ItemName=repel%20wood">repel wood</a> is a powerful combo that keeps metal-wielding foes on the defensive.
