If a PC receives a scaling item of a caster level lower than her character level, she effectively receives an item that's worth more than the price listed in the stat block. Reference <a href="rulesd734.html?Name=Adjusting%20Treasure&amp;Category=Scaling%20Items">Table 4-13: Value of Scaling Items</a> and use the PC's level to estimate how much the item is really worth to that PC, and use that purchase price as its treasure value. Giving an item with a caster level higher than the character's level doesn't present the same problems; it just means the PC won't be unlocking the item's higher-level powers for some time. Don't reduce treasure for such an item until the PC's level exceeds the item's caster level.
