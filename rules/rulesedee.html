Once you have determined the creature's role, it's time to add class levels. The first step of this process is to modify the creature's ability scores. Creatures with class levels receive +4, +4, +2, +2, +0, and -2 adjustments to their ability scores, assigned in a manner that enhances their class abilities. Creatures with NPC class levels do not receive adjustments to their ability scores.

Next, add the class levels to the monster, making all of the necessary additions to its HD, hit points, BAB, CMB, CMD, feats, skills, spells, and class features. If the creature possesses class features (such as spellcasting or sneak attack) for the class that is being added, these abilities stack. This functions just like adding class levels to a character without racial Hit Dice.

A monster with class levels always possesses treasure equal to an NPC of a level equal to the monster's final CR (as calculated in Step 3, below). To determine the value of this gear, use the <a href="rulesd93e.html?Name=Step%206:%20Gear&amp;Category=Creating%20NPCs">value listed for a heroic NPC of that level</a>. Once a total GP value is determined, follow the rules for outfitting an NPC as outlined in that chapter. Gear should help a monster with class levels remain challenging and retain statistics close to those presented on <a href="rulesebc6.html?Name=Step%202:%20Target%20Statistics&amp;Category=Monster%20Creation">Table 1-1: Monster Statistics by CR</a>.
