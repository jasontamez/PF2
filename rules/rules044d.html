A variety of actions are available to fiends who possess creatures, objects, or locations. GMs are encouraged to use these abilities as guidelines and create similar abilities for their own fiendish villains and extraplanar plots. Each possession action is presented in the following format.

Name: The name of the action in question. The number in parentheses after the name lists the number of possession points ("PP") the action costs to perform.

Expression: This indicates whether or not the action has a visible effect when it manifests (physical) or if it happens entirely within the host's head (spiritual). The listed DC indicates the Perception or Sense Motive check required by those nearby to notice the fact that the target is possessed. Note that a possessed creature does not automatically realize that it is possessed, but it gains a +10 bonus on all Perception or Sense Motive checks to notice that it is indeed possessed when the fiend uses a possession action

Duration: This lists the duration of the effect once the fiend activates the possession action. Durations listed as directly tied to HD use the possessing fiend's HD to set the duration.

Saving Throw: This indicates what sort of saving throw the possessed creature, location, object, or target of the action can make to negate or reduce the effects of the action. In all cases, the DC for this saving throw is DC 10 + the HD of the possessing fiend + the fiend's Cha modifier.

A fiend possesses a creature's body not only to torture its victim, but to torment the possessed creature's loved ones. More often than not, a fiend aggressively inhabits a host, but sometimes a misguided mortal might call a fiend into his body in search of otherworldly power. This rarely works to the mortal's advantage, as bodily possession is essentially an abduction of one's self. Occasionally fiends might grant a taste of power in order to bribe the mortal into compliance with its own wishes and punish actions deviating from their desires, but few fiends possess victims for any other reason than absolute control.



Defile Body (3 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Fortitude partial
The possessing fiend, when displeased, can cause physical harm to the target. This damage manifests in a number of ways, from searing pain to limbs physically wrenched in agonizing ways. Each fiend delivers this damage in a different way, but the damage done always bypasses any damage reduction, resistance, or immunity to damage that the host might possess. If the host fails to resist this ability, it takes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 Hit Dice the fiend possesses. If it makes the Fotitude save, the painful spasms only sicken the host for 1 round.



Elusive Presence (3 Or 1 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 35)
Duraiton 1 hour or instantaneous
Saving Throw none
A fiend may use this action to hide itself from detect spells or to pass through a <a href="spelldisplay876d.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20evil">magic circle against evil</a> or the effects of a <a href="spelldisplayb405.html?ItemName=forbiddance">forbiddance</a> spell. The fiend must make a Will save equal to 10 + the caster level of the spell + the caster's relevant ability modifier. If it succeeds, the spell only detects the host and in no way hinders or reveals the fiend. If the fiend fails, though, the spells treat the host as if it were the fiend, providing information or barring the host as such.

Alternatively, a fiend may spend an additional possession point as a swift action when activating any other possession action to make that action elusive. This supresses that possession action's expression, increasing the DC to notice the effect by +10.



Fiendish Manifestation (3 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
The possessing fiend causes its host to undergo a terrible change. Any creature subject to the alter appearance action must succeed on a Will save. If the host fails, the possessing fiend manifests a hint of its presence, perhaps in the form of glowing eyes, an inhuman growl, a ghastly stench, or spontaneous bleeding. This manifestation is obvious to anyone looking at the host. As long as the manifestation persists, the host creature suffers a -2 penalty on all Charisma-based checks.



Subversive (3 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 45)
Duration 1 hour/HD or until completed
Saving Throw Will negates
Some possessing fiends wish to remain hidden, even from their victims. To do so, a fiend and its host make opposed Wisdom checks. If the host succeeds, it is aware that some force beyond itself is manipulating it. If the fiend succeeds, it may communicate a simple idea to its host via telepathy, as per the spell <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a>. Alternatively, it may prevent its host from acknowledging a possession action it uses in the next round, even if such has a blatant visual effect-the host simply has no memory of having done anything out of the ordinary. This ability automatically activates the elusive presence ability and cannot be made further elusive through the use of elusive presence. This ability is a mind-affecting effect.



Alter Mood (5 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 25)
Duration 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
The possessing fiend twists positive moods and feelings toward a foul temperament. A fiend using this action forces its host to make a Will save or experience despondent or depressive emotions. A host affected by this ability becomes sickened for the duration of the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.



Fiendish Force (5 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
The possessing fiend causes its host to rise into the air, manifesting a degree of its malign control over its victim's body. This effect is similar to the spell <a href="spelldisplay7355.html?ItemName=levitate">levitate</a>, which the fiend has complete control over and may end at will. The host may make a Will save to resist this effect.



Read Thoughts (5 PP)

Expression spiritual (DC 25)
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
The possessing fiend taps into the mind of the creature it possesses. Like the spell <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a>, a fiend may peruse the surface thoughts of the host. Unlike the spell, a fiend automatically skips the first and second round results and immediately reads the target it possesses if the host fails a Will save.



Vile Gout (5 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Will negates, Reflex half
The possessing fiend causes a blast of unnatural force to explode from its host's body. This takes the form of a 15-foot cone of acid, fire, cold, or sonic energy-typically mixed with bodily fluids or unnatural expulsions-that deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 Hit Dice the fiend possesses. The host may make a Will save to negate this effect. Those within the area of the gout can make a Reflex save to take half damage.



Read Memories (7 PP)

Expression spiritual
Duration instantaneous or 1 round/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
A possessing fiend can use this action to learn more about its host's past experiences. Fiends using this action essentially ask a question of a host's mind, forcing the host to make a Will save. If the fiend succeeds, it gains the answer to its question if the host possesses such information. Alternatively, a fiend might merely seek painful memories or vague details pertinent to an event, location, or individual. If the host fails its save, the painful memories stagger him for 1 round per HD of the possessing fiend.



Drain Host (7 PP)

Expression physical (Perception DC 10)
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Fortitue negates
The possessing fiend decreases its host's ability scores. If the host fails to resist this ability, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to an ability score chosen by the fiend. A fiend cannot reduce a single ability score below 1 by using this ability. Typically, a fiend uses this ability to punish unfavorable actions its host takes.



Empower Host (7 PP)

Expression physical (Perception DC 20)
Duration 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless)
The possessing fiend enhances its host's prowess by granting a +2 profane bonus to one of its host's ability scores chosen by the fiend. A host can resist this benefit by making a Will save. A possessing fiend may grant this bonus multiple times to either the same or different abilities (additional profane bonuses to the same ability stack when granted by a possessing fiend). Typically, these bonuses also cause some subtle side effect, such as writhing veins rising from one's muscles or a subtly forked tongue. These expressions of fiendish influence have no additional effect and are only noticeable to those who closely examine the host.



Dominate Body (9 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 15)
Duration 1 round/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
The possessing fiend takes control over its host's body and actions. If the host fails to resist this ability, the fiend can direct the creature to attack, cast spells, or otherwise perform any other action so desired. Every round, a dominated host may attempt an additional Will save to break the fiend's control. A fiend cannot dominate a creature more than 4 Hit Dice higher than itself. This is a mind-affecting effect.



Erase Memories (9 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 35)
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw Will negates
This powerful ability allows a possessing fiend to selectively alter a host's memories. When using this action, a fiend can manipulate the memories experienced by the host as per the spell <a href="spelldisplayea0c-2.html?ItemName=modify%20memory">modify memory</a>. The host may make a Will save to avoid this effect. This is a mind-affecting effect.



Make Pact (9 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 35)
Duration see below
Saving Throw none
A possessing fiend and its host constantly struggle for mastery of the body they both possess. Sometimes, though, these two opposing spirits reach an accord, coming to at least a temporary understanding and degree of shared control. In such cases, a fiend and its host may agree to a pact. Both parties must agree to the terms of a pact, usually taking the form of an arrangement where the host allows the fiend to perform some act without his resistance and the fiend allows the host freedom to undertake some act without its interference. This effect takes the form of two <a href="spelldisplay8acc.html?ItemName=geas/quest">geas/quest</a> effects, both affecting the same body but under different terms-one stated by the host and one by the fiend. The host and fiend decide in advance in which order their goals will be pursued. As this arrangement must be voluntary, no save is required. This is not a spell effect and cannot be removed by spells that normally affect geas/quest; rather, the fiendish or mortal personality compels the body to a certain stated course. When both parties have completed their goals, the pact ends. Fiends typically attempt to mislead or confuse their host with the terms or weight of their side of a pact, but so long as the host agrees to a pact and the stated goals of the pact remain the same, the host cannot renege due to specifics. A pact does not necessarily represent cooperation between a fiend and its host, however, as some fiends use this action as a contract in order to ensure the host fulfills obligations.



Transfer Spell-Like Ability (9 PP)

Expression Physical (Perception DC 30)
Duration 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless)
The possessing fiend grants its host a taste of its unnatural powers. The fiend imbues its host with the ability to utilize one of its spell-like abilities (chosen by the fiend) for the ability's duration. Utilizing this spell-like ability is a standard action for the host, but is treated as being used by the fiend for the purposes of determining caster level and save DCs. A host might be able to utilize this ability multiple times, but cannot use it more times per day than the fiend itself could. Typically a fiend uses this action as a way to endear the host to its presence or as a way to show the greater power of its fiendish ways.

<a href="rules38d2.html?Name=Object%20Possession&amp;Category=Possession%20Actions">Object Possession</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy8b9h">Pathfinder #28: The Infernal Syndrome pg. 61</a>
A fiend possesses objects either as a way to control them or as a way to infiltrate a body in a clandestine manner. A fiend in possession of an object can perform the following possession actions. Unless otherwise specified, these actions take a full-round action. While possessing an object, a fiend retains its normal senses, and may sense in every direction around the object, but otherwise perceives its surroundings as normal. Often a possessed item exhibits unusual characteristics, such as an unnatural tarnish, an accumulation of greasy film on its surface, or an unnaturally temperature. Even when these effects are not present, a creature can detect something strange about the item by utilizing spells like <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a>.



Seed (3 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive 30)
Duration 1 hour
Saving Throw none
The fiend weakens the will of a creature in contact with the object it possesses. This action causes a creature holding the possessed object to gradually become more vulnerable to the possessing fiend's influence. Upon using this ability, a fiend subtly invades the mind of a creature touching the item it possesses. After 5 minutes, if the same creature has remained in contact with the possessed object, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saves made to resist attempts by that fiend to possess its body. This effect lasts for 24 hours. The target does not receive a saving throw against this effect.



Read User (5 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive 15)
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
The fiend taps into the mind of a creature in contact with the object it possesses. This action mimics the <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a> spell, except that the possessing fiend immediately picks up on the surface thoughts of the creature touching the object. The target may attempt a Will save to block the fiend from its mind. This effect continues for as long as the target remains in contact with the possessed object.



Animation, Minor (7 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 round/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object can cause that object to move at its command. This allows a fiend to cause any object of Large size or smaller to function as an animated object for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Alternatively, a fiend can merely cause the object to levitate, as per the spell, for the same amount of time.



Corrupt User (7 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 30)
Duration 1 hour/HD or until completed
Saving Throw Will negates
The fiend influences the actions of a creature in contact with the object it possesses, telepathically implanting a suggestion (as per the spell <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a>). While acting upon this suggestion, the target's alignment is detected as being the same as the fiend's. This does not change the way in which the target acts, merely how alignment- revealing magic perceives him. This is a mind-affecting effect.



Dispel Enhancement (7 PP)

Expression physical
Duration 1 hour/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing a magic item can suppress the imbued magic of the object for a short period. To use this action, the fiend makes a special dispel check (1d20 + the fiend's HD, maximum +10) against the caster level of the magic item. If the fiend succeeds, all magical properties of the item are suppressed for a number of hours equal to the fiend's Hit Dice, or until the fiend chooses to end the effect.



Reinvigoration (7 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 hour/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object may transpose a portion of its being into a corpse within 10 feet per HD of the object's possessing fiend. This allows the fiend to raise skeletons and zombies as per the spell <a href="spelldisplay4c3e.html?ItemName=animate%20dead">animate dead</a>. The possessing fiend's Hit Dice serve as the caster level for the purposes of this effect. This use of animate dead does not require a material component, but the undead created are not permanent, collapsing back to corpses as soon as the ability's duration expires.



Enhance (9 PP)

Expression physical (Perception 20)
Duration 1 day
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object can imbue the item with its profane energies to mimic magical enchantment. When a fiend uses this action, it grants the possessed item magical properties equal to 1,000 gp per Hit Die the fiend possesses. This action is typically used on weapons and armor, though a fiend can duplicate other magic items if it possesses an appropriate item. The possessed item does not need to be of masterwork quality for the fiend to bestow these magical properties. For example, a 9-HD erinyes can imbue an item with up to 9,000 gp worth of magical properties. Thus the erinyes can make a normal longsword perform as if it were a +2 longsword or even a +1 <a href="magicweaponsdisplaye026.html?ItemName=Vicious">vicious</a> longsword. Likewise, the same erinyes could possess an amulet and cause it to act as an <a href="magicwondrousdisplay819b.html?FinalName=Amulet%20of%20Natural%20Armor1">amulet of natural armor +2</a>.

The fiend, and not the user of the object, is in control of the properties of the item, even if it has been forced into possessing the item via a spell like <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a> or <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a>. Each use of this ability lasts for 24 hours or until the fiend dismisses the effect. The fiend can remove these properties at will, and when the fiend leaves the item, the magical properties immediately vanish. A fiend cannot cause an item to take on properties other than those typical to its shape (one could not create a +1 vicious helmet, for example).



Animation, Major (13 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 round/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object can cause that object and those around it to move at its command. This effect is identical to the <a href="spelldisplay72da.html?ItemName=animate%20objects">animate objects</a> spell, except that the object the fiend possesses must be included among the items to be animated. The possessing fiend's Hit Dice serve as the caster level for the purposes of this effect. In addition, all animated objects gain a fly speed equal to the fiend's highest movement speed with perfect maneuverability.

<a href="rules7940.html?Name=Possesed%20Locations&amp;Category=Possession%20Actions">Possesed Locations</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/councilOfThieves/v5748btpy8b9h">Pathfinder #28: The Infernal Syndrome pg. 63</a>
A fiend can nestle itself within a location in order to taint the place with evil and potentially corrupt or assault a number of targets. Fiends possessing places generally choose locations already welcoming of evil, or mundane sites with little worry for matters otherworldly. A fiend possess a distinct, roughly spherical space based on its Hit Dice. This location might be as simple as a single room in a building, or an entire castle. An imp spy might possess the town's well, while a maralith might influence an entire demon-tainted grove. While in possession of a location, a fiend can perform a small number of actions, usually in the interest of finding a suitable creature for bodily possession. Some fiends possess their lairs as a way to maintain awareness throughout an area and more easily enslave interlopers and minions.

A fiend in possession of a location can perform the following possession actions. Unless otherwise specified, these actions take a full-round action. While possessing a location, a fiend sees everything within the area it possesses, using its own senses. It perceives areas outside of this space as if it were a viewer standing at any edge of its possessed area. Often a possessed area exhibits unusual characteristics, such as strange temperature shifts, eerie noises, or noxious scents. Even when these effects are not present, a creature can detect something strange about the location by utilizing spells like <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a>.



Seed Area (5 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 30)
Duration 1 hour
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing a location weakens the willpower of those within its area, allowing an easier path to bodily possession. Upon using this ability, a fiend subtly invades the mind of a creature within the location it inhabits. After 5 minutes, if the same creature has remained within the possessed area, the target takes a -2 penalty on Will saves made to resist attempts by that fiend to possess its body. This effect last for 24 hours. The target does not receive a saving throw against this effect.



Read Inhabitants (7 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 15)
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
A fiend can tap into the mind of creatures in the area it possesses. This action mimics the spell <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a> with a caster level equal to the fiend's Hit Dice. The targets of this action can attempt Will saves throw to resist this effect.



Dominion (Variable PP)

Expression physical (Perception DC 20)
Duration see below
Saving Throw see below
A fiend possessing a location can manipulate the area it controls to terrifying ends. At will, the fiend can make use of any of the following spell-like abilities to affect creatures within the area it possesses. It can "cast" these spell-like abilities from any physical point within the area of its possessed location.

In every case, the caster level for these spell-like abilities equals the possessing fiend's Hit Dice and the cost in possession points equals 1 + the spell's level. None of these effects, regardless of its potential range or space, extends beyond the space of the fiend's possession.
