Two principles of magic to remember when considering spell components are that of contagion (a part retains a connection to the whole) and sympathy (like produces like). A component can be linked to its source, manipulating or drawing power from that source, or it can produce effects based upon its nature.

Historically, components such as blood carried both the life and strength of a creature, and the potential to bind two lives together; coffin nails could be pounded or bound into a weapon, making it strike true; hair and nails rendered the original owner vulnerable to hostile magic even at great distances; and animal horns and tusks provide protection to their wearer, not to mention the healing properties of a unicorn's horn.

Most spell components in the Pathfinder RPG are based on sympathy, either duplicating the desired outcome of the spell (gauze and a wisp of smoke for <a href="spelldisplay1973.html?ItemName=gaseous%20form">gaseous form</a>) or having properties related to the spell (an owl's feather for <a href="spelldisplayaa6f.html?ItemName=owl%e2%80%99s%20wisdom">owl's wisdom</a>). The latter sort of component may utilize contagion as well, as the single feather retains the nature of the whole.

When adding material components or a focus to a new spell, consider what forces the spell is shaping, and select components that reflect those forces. Good components don't necessarily need to be literally appropriate-the handful of earth required for <a href="spelldisplay5c7d.html?ItemName=detect%20undead">detect undead</a> is an example of a more symbolic fit. Humorous spell components are tempting (and well represented in the game), but should be used sparingly.
