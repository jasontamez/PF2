In both the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and GameMastery Guide, <a href="spelldisplayc2fb.html?ItemName=restoration,%20lesser">lesser restoration</a> has no effect on insanity, but under these rules it can be used to treat lesser madnesses. Conversely, <a href="spelldisplay7255.html?ItemName=restoration,%20greater">greater restoration</a>, <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayfca1.html?ItemName=psychic%20surgery">psychic surgery</a> have reduced effects against greater madnesses in this system compared to in the previous books. This allows madnesses to play a larger part at both higher and lower levels in horror games, or any other game featuring psychological threats. If you want to feature the madnesses as afflictions that are simple to remove for high-level spellcasters while outside the reach of anyone else- as per the more baseline Pathfinder RPG experience-assume lesser madnesses are not affected by <a href="spelldisplayc2fb.html?ItemName=restoration,%20lesser">lesser restoration</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay7255.html?ItemName=restoration,%20greater">greater restoration</a>, <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayfca1.html?ItemName=psychic%20surgery">psychic surgery</a> remove all madnesses, whether lesser or greater.
