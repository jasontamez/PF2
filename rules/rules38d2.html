A fiend possesses objects either as a way to control them or as a way to infiltrate a body in a clandestine manner. A fiend in possession of an object can perform the following possession actions. Unless otherwise specified, these actions take a full-round action. While possessing an object, a fiend retains its normal senses, and may sense in every direction around the object, but otherwise perceives its surroundings as normal. Often a possessed item exhibits unusual characteristics, such as an unnatural tarnish, an accumulation of greasy film on its surface, or an unnaturally temperature. Even when these effects are not present, a creature can detect something strange about the item by utilizing spells like <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a>.



Seed (3 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive 30)
Duration 1 hour
Saving Throw none
The fiend weakens the will of a creature in contact with the object it possesses. This action causes a creature holding the possessed object to gradually become more vulnerable to the possessing fiend's influence. Upon using this ability, a fiend subtly invades the mind of a creature touching the item it possesses. After 5 minutes, if the same creature has remained in contact with the possessed object, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saves made to resist attempts by that fiend to possess its body. This effect lasts for 24 hours. The target does not receive a saving throw against this effect.



Read User (5 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive 15)
Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/HD
Saving Throw Will negates
The fiend taps into the mind of a creature in contact with the object it possesses. This action mimics the <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a> spell, except that the possessing fiend immediately picks up on the surface thoughts of the creature touching the object. The target may attempt a Will save to block the fiend from its mind. This effect continues for as long as the target remains in contact with the possessed object.



Animation, Minor (7 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 round/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object can cause that object to move at its command. This allows a fiend to cause any object of Large size or smaller to function as an animated object for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Alternatively, a fiend can merely cause the object to levitate, as per the spell, for the same amount of time.



Corrupt User (7 PP)

Expression spiritual (Sense Motive DC 30)
Duration 1 hour/HD or until completed
Saving Throw Will negates
The fiend influences the actions of a creature in contact with the object it possesses, telepathically implanting a suggestion (as per the spell <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a>). While acting upon this suggestion, the target's alignment is detected as being the same as the fiend's. This does not change the way in which the target acts, merely how alignment- revealing magic perceives him. This is a mind-affecting effect.



Dispel Enhancement (7 PP)

Expression physical
Duration 1 hour/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing a magic item can suppress the imbued magic of the object for a short period. To use this action, the fiend makes a special dispel check (1d20 + the fiend's HD, maximum +10) against the caster level of the magic item. If the fiend succeeds, all magical properties of the item are suppressed for a number of hours equal to the fiend's Hit Dice, or until the fiend chooses to end the effect.



Reinvigoration (7 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 hour/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object may transpose a portion of its being into a corpse within 10 feet per HD of the object's possessing fiend. This allows the fiend to raise skeletons and zombies as per the spell <a href="spelldisplay4c3e.html?ItemName=animate%20dead">animate dead</a>. The possessing fiend's Hit Dice serve as the caster level for the purposes of this effect. This use of animate dead does not require a material component, but the undead created are not permanent, collapsing back to corpses as soon as the ability's duration expires.



Enhance (9 PP)

Expression physical (Perception 20)
Duration 1 day
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object can imbue the item with its profane energies to mimic magical enchantment. When a fiend uses this action, it grants the possessed item magical properties equal to 1,000 gp per Hit Die the fiend possesses. This action is typically used on weapons and armor, though a fiend can duplicate other magic items if it possesses an appropriate item. The possessed item does not need to be of masterwork quality for the fiend to bestow these magical properties. For example, a 9-HD erinyes can imbue an item with up to 9,000 gp worth of magical properties. Thus the erinyes can make a normal longsword perform as if it were a +2 longsword or even a +1 <a href="magicweaponsdisplaye026.html?ItemName=Vicious">vicious</a> longsword. Likewise, the same erinyes could possess an amulet and cause it to act as an <a href="magicwondrousdisplay819b.html?FinalName=Amulet%20of%20Natural%20Armor1">amulet of natural armor +2</a>.

The fiend, and not the user of the object, is in control of the properties of the item, even if it has been forced into possessing the item via a spell like <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a> or <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a>. Each use of this ability lasts for 24 hours or until the fiend dismisses the effect. The fiend can remove these properties at will, and when the fiend leaves the item, the magical properties immediately vanish. A fiend cannot cause an item to take on properties other than those typical to its shape (one could not create a +1 vicious helmet, for example).



Animation, Major (13 PP)

Expression physical (automatic)
Duration 1 round/HD
Saving Throw none
A fiend possessing an object can cause that object and those around it to move at its command. This effect is identical to the <a href="spelldisplay72da.html?ItemName=animate%20objects">animate objects</a> spell, except that the object the fiend possesses must be included among the items to be animated. The possessing fiend's Hit Dice serve as the caster level for the purposes of this effect. In addition, all animated objects gain a fly speed equal to the fiend's highest movement speed with perfect maneuverability.
