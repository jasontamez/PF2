The ability that governs <a href="rules6f74.html?Name=Determine%20Bonuses&amp;Category=Generating%20Ability%20Scores">bonus spells</a> depends on what type of spellcaster your character is: Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, and rangers; and Charisma for bards, paladins, and sorcerers. In addition to having a high ability score, a spellcaster must be of a high enough class level to be able to cast spells or use spell slots of a given spell level. See the class descriptions in Chapter 3 for details.
