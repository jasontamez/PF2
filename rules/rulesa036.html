The wilderness is a place of constant change, so it's no surprise that most wilderness-appropriate spells come from the transmutation school of magic. These spells not only mutate the caster and her immediate surroundings but also are highly sought-after ways to control plant life. As plants are universally immune to mind-affecting effects, it falls to transmutation spells to grant a modicum of control over these creatures, providing an analogue to spells commonly found in the enchantment school.

<a href="spelldisplay2a6a.html?ItemName=Diminish%20Plants">Diminish Plants</a>: This spell controls the vegetation in a specific area. The prune growth option for this spell is an effective counter to spells such as <a href="spelldisplaye879.html?ItemName=entangle">entangle</a> and <a href="spelldisplay7b44.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20thorns">wall of thorns</a>, granting the caster some combat control in addition to straightforward utility. Using this spell also allows for the creation of open areas more amenable to mounts or other big creatures. The secondary use of <a href="spelldisplay7a68.html?ItemName=diminish%20plants">diminish plants</a>, the stunt growth option, is most effective as a narrative tool. Spiteful PCs seeking to punish an enemy druid might decide to use this effect on the druid's preferred territory. Conversely, an enemy druid might wrack the PCs' homeland with several castings of this spell, potentially leading to starvation in the face of reduced crop yields. PCs who have left their homeland for a prolonged period of time might be drawn back after hearing word that a magically induced famine has taken hold, only to find that the cause was a previous foe from the campaign!

<a href="spelldisplay13fd.html?ItemName=Meld%20into%20Stone">Meld into Stone</a> and <a href="spelldisplay3f69.html?ItemName=Tree%20Shape">Tree Shape</a>: Hiding in blocks of stone or taking the form of a shrub allows for both intrigue and tense moments of avoiding a threat. PCs and NPCs can use these spells to perform highly effective spying on their enemies, with very few effects or spells being able to reveal the presence of a melded or shaped creature. <a href="spelldisplay256c.html?ItemName=True%20seeing">True seeing</a> or a similar effect could spell disaster for a stone-melded creature, and the destruction of the melded stone has immediate-not to mention mortal-repercussions. Be sure to reward the creative use of these spells when used by the PCs, but also make them aware of the dangers of using them, should the PCs come to rely on these spells as a guaranteed means for avoiding detection and spying on foes.

<a href="spelldisplay9ee3.html?ItemName=Pass%20without%20Trace">Pass without Trace</a>: This basic 1st-level spell can defeat even the most dedicated of trackers. <a href="spelldisplayf898.html?ItemName=Pass%20without%20trace">Pass without trace</a> prevents being tracked by a Survival check or any other nonmagical means. Only spells such as <a href="spelldisplay2fc4.html?ItemName=locate%20creature">locate creature</a> are suitable for tracking creatures that have obfuscated themselves with <a href="spelldisplayba64.html?ItemName=pass%20without%20trace">pass without trace</a>, and such spells aren't readily accessible until later levels. Due to the difficulty in countering this spell at lower levels, the best point to take advantage of <a href="spelldisplayba64.html?ItemName=pass%20without%20trace">pass without trace</a> is in the 4th- to 6th-level range, when the spell can affect all members of the average party and rangers gain access to the spell. At levels above that, the foes can use magical countermeasures to overcome <a href="spelldisplayba64.html?ItemName=pass%20without%20trace">pass without trace</a>.

<a href="spelldisplayb74b.html?ItemName=Plant%20Growth">Plant Growth</a> and <a href="spelldisplay866f.html?ItemName=Spike%20Growth">Spike Growth</a>: Control of the battlefield is essential when fighting in a wilderness environment. As many such environments lack manufactured cover and traps, it falls to magic to create such hazards. <a href="spelldisplay520c.html?ItemName=Plant%20growth">Plant growth</a> can drastically cut down on targets' maneuverability on a battlefield, allowing spellcasters to target enemies from afar, or even enhancing the effectiveness of spells such as <a href="spelldisplaye879.html?ItemName=entangle">entangle</a>. Similarly, <a href="spelldisplay1670.html?ItemName=spike%20growth">spike growth</a> creates areas of damaging terrain that are difficult to bypass without some means of flight or levitation. In wilderness-heavy campaigns, these spells can be on par with other control-based magic, while in campaigns with only a smattering of wilderness, these spells operate best when taken in the form of one or more backup scrolls.

<a href="spelldisplay0e67.html?ItemName=Quench">Quench: Often forgotten due to its specialized nature, <a href="spelldisplayd7e0.html?ItemName=quench">quench</a> can swiftly extinguish fire-based creatures, effects, and spells. The typical use of the spell is to put out nonmagical fires in its considerable area of effect (a minimum of 5 20-foot cubes at minimum caster level). A more potent use of the spell is to act as a dispelling effect on fire-based spells in its area. This allows the spell to be reserved and used to counter potent spells such as <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a> or <a href="spelldisplay77b1.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20fire">wall of fire</a>, though only if a character expects such spells to be used. Using the spell on magic items that create or control flame can change the combat dynamic, especially if the effect is considerable (such as disabling the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay24ed.html?ItemName=Flaming%20Burst">flaming burst</a> ability from an enemy's weapon). Creatures with the fire subtype are particularly vulnerable to <a href="spelldisplayd7e0.html?ItemName=quench">quench</a>, taking anywhere from 5d6 to 10d6 points of damage without any sort of save-a <a href="spelldisplayd7e0.html?ItemName=quench">wand of quench</a> is a potent weapon against such foes.

<a href="spelldisplay3b94.html?ItemName=Stone%20Shape">Stone Shape</a> and <a href="spelldisplay2ffb.html?ItemName=Wood%20Shape">Wood Shape</a>: Building a bridge, creating a door, or manufacturing a barricade are all immediate uses for shaping magic such as <a href="spelldisplay5dc8.html?ItemName=stone%20shape">stone shape</a> and <a href="spelldisplayf109.html?ItemName=wood%20shape">wood shape</a>. The wording of these spells is very open to interpretation, granting a lot of leeway in adjudicating their effects. Unexpected barriers can change the dynamic of combat or wilderness exploration, so be sure to have a basic understanding of the consequences of using these spells in areas primarily made of stone or wood. Just as PCs can use these spells to upturn encounters, their adversaries can use these spells to surprise them in dynamic ways. The PCs might explore a chamber with one entrance only to be ambushed from a stone-shaped wall during their inspection of the area, or an NPC villain might allow half the party to go through an exit door before cutting it off with a well-timed casting of <a href="spelldisplayf109.html?ItemName=wood%20shape">wood shape</a>.

<a href="spelldisplayc285.html?ItemName=Water%20Breathing">Water Breathing</a> and <a href="spelldisplay3b83.html?ItemName=Water%20Walk">Water Walk</a>: Both of these spells accomplish different things, but they are similar in that they overcome an incredibly common wilderness impediment: water. Watery barriers can include a lake in the middle of a forest, rivers running between mountains, a series of flooded chambers in a cavern, treacherous swamps, and underground oceans. <a href="spelldisplaybb52.html?ItemName=Water%20breathing">Water breathing</a> can be split among numerous creatures effectively, allowing for long or quick treks underwater. Similar magic, such as <a href="spelldisplay2655.html?ItemName=aboleth's%20lung">aboleth's lung</a> or <a href="spelldisplay3a66.html?ItemName=air%20bubble">air bubble</a>, can function in similar roles to <a href="spelldisplay0196.html?ItemName=water%20breathing">water breathing</a> at a lower spell level, albeit at reduced efficiency. Player characters often come to rely on these spells to traverse difficult environments, sometimes believing in a simple "cast and forget" mantra. Be sure to occasionally remind the PCs of their reliance on these spells, such as directing a casting of <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a> in their direction. It's best to give this kind of reminder in a situation where it's possible to recover so that the potential for a more disastrous situation can loom large in the mind. Dispelling <a href="spelldisplay0196.html?ItemName=water%20breathing">water breathing</a> when the PCs are deep underwater and have no way to escape and no more ways to cast the spell can mean certain death, so you shouldn't spring this tactic on players often-if ever!

<a href="spelldisplayddf7.html?ItemName=Whispering%20Wind">Whispering Wind</a>: While <a href="spelldisplaya2f7.html?ItemName=sending">sending</a> requires 10 minutes to cast, <a href="spelldisplayd1f3.html?ItemName=whispering%20wind">whispering wind</a> takes only a standard action. Use of this spell doesn't guarantee a successful transmission though, as it requires the caster to be knowledgeable of a specific location within range, but even then, there's no guarantee that the intended recipient is at the designated location. It's also entirely possible that if the PCs find themselves camping at an easily identifiable landmark, they might become the unintended recipients of a <a href="spelldisplayd1f3.html?ItemName=whispering%20wind">whispering wind</a> message. Mistakenly receiving a message in this manner could spark a new adventure or entire campaign, especially when you consider that <a href="spelldisplayd1f3.html?ItemName=whispering%20wind">whispering wind</a> often revolves around the need to get a message out in a quick and urgent manner.
