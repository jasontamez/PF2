The body is a frail, little-understood thing that might betray its host-consciousness at any moment. This visceral subgenre concerns itself with the organic terror of the flesh, including disease, physical corruption, and transformation. At its basest level, body horror is the revulsion felt upon hearing a bone break or seeing a joint violently bend in the wrong direction. Elaborated upon, it's the terror of becoming physically monstrous and the awfulness that might hide within.

Storytelling: Body horror plots often concern themselves with transformation. This might be in a mundane fashion, such as a character racing to find a cure for a withering disease, trying to escape enemy territory with a broken leg, or knowing that a parasite is devouring his flesh. Unleashed from reality, body horror might involve an uncontrolled transformation, a disease that has gained sentience, or a monster that consumes flesh or blood. Body horror plots can involve a timeline or countdown, evoking a disease running its course or an untreated wound turning gangrenous. The only way to stop the spread of whatever fleshy terror has been unleashed is to cure it medically or excise it with sword or spell before it is too late. Doing so often comes with the greatest threat of body horror: infection. Characters might suffer <a href="rules503d.html?Name=Curses&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">curses</a>, <a href="rules0bac.html?Name=Horrific%20Diseases&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">contract terrible illnesses</a>, <a href="rules415e.html?Name=Corruption&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">undergo horrific corruptions</a>, or become host to ravenous parasites. Customize body horror effects to the story's needs, pairing nauseating descriptions with game-affecting effects like loss of limbs, hit point damage, ability score drain, inability to naturally heal, or worse.

GMs running body horror adventures will likely find that many players have powerful reactions to descriptions of gore and disease symptoms. A GM should describe such scenes in a way that's right for her players, and remember that gratuitous descriptions quickly lose their impact. Uncertainty and time are also powerful factors in body horror stories, with PCs often unsure whether they or those they love are safe from infection-and if they don't show signs today, what about tomorrow?

The enemy in a body horror game can also be unclear. While it might be individuals spreading a plague, a race of sentient parasites, or a mad scientist transforming victims, it might also be simply a disease itself. The former examples lend themselves toward common Pathfinder plots. The latter, though, might unfold as a scavenger hunt or series of challenges that contribute toward concocting a cure. In such cases, the final challenge should be the most harrowing and present the greatest risk of exposure to infection. In that way, the defeat of the invisible menace has a climax, but it also has the extremely personal threat of another outbreak.

Monsters and Threats: Parasites and diseases often feature in body horror stories, so consider rot grubs (of the <a href="monsterdisplay979d.html?ItemName=Giant%20Rot%20Grub">giant variety</a> or more <a href="rulesbe60.html?Name=Rot%20Grubs%20(CR%204)&amp;Category=Sample%20Hazards">common hazards</a>), <a href="rules7028.html?Name=Ear%20Seekers%20(CR%205)&amp;Category=Sample%20Hazards">ear seekers</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay6855.html?ItemName=Intellect%20Devourer">intellect devourers</a>, or <a href="diseases0d47.html?ItemName=All">visceral plagues of disease</a> (though consider using the <a href="rulesabc1.html?Name=Diseases%20and%20Poisons&amp;Category=Pathfinder%20Unchained">unchained rules for diseases</a>) or the disease section of this book. Creatures that implant their eggs or are born from other creatures include <a href="monsterdisplay924a.html?ItemName=Lunarma">lunarmas</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay44c5.html?ItemName=Vegepygmy">vegepygmies</a>, and <a href="monsterdisplay57e5.html?ItemName=Xill">xills</a>, while those who cling to or take over a host's body include <a href="monsterdisplayc0fe.html?ItemName=Incutilis">incutilises</a> and <a href="monsterdisplay3293.html?ItemName=Wizard%e2%80%99s%20Shackle">wizard's shackles</a>. <a href="monsterfamiliesfd89.html?ItemName=Fleshwarp">Fleshwarps</a> and oozes like <a href="monsterdisplaydf61.html?ItemName=Carnivorous%20Blob">carnivorous blobs</a> embody the horror of abominable transformation, <a href="monsterdisplaye925.html?ItemName=Beheaded">beheaded</a> and <a href="monsterdisplayf6e2.html?ItemName=Crawling%20Hand">crawling hands</a> are unbound body parts, and <a href="racesdisplayde00.html?ItemName=Drow">drow</a> and <a href="monsterfamilies2ecb.html?ItemName=Kyton">kytons</a> use flesh as mediums for their art or taboo experimentations. Many of the corruptions and the <a href="rulesa36b.html?Name=Fleshwarping&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">fleshwarping rules</a> also allow a PC to experience the terror of transformation firsthand.

Basic Plots: A quarantine traps the PCs in a city suffering from bubonic plague. A breed of oozes infests a community's sewers, changing those they touch into melting zombies. <a href="monsterdisplayab30.html?ItemName=Ghorazagh">Ghorazaghs</a> capture the PCs in a labyrinthine scab-hive.

Advanced Plots: The secret of an incestuous imperial dynasty reveals an undercity of vain, inbred <a href="monsterdisplay9751.html?ItemName=Mongrelman">mongrelmen</a> lurking beneath the capital. A mind-altering disease (to which elves are mysteriously immune) becomes sentient, infects the minds of hundreds, and launches a pogrom against those it can't infect. A nation's pervasive, cowlike herd animals stave off famine, but the nation turns on the PCs when they expose that the creatures are semi-sentient <a href="mythicmonsterdisplay0f9b.html?ItemName=Drakainia">drakainia</a> spawn.
