All-Around Vision (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have some way of seeing all around them, granting them a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks and making them immune to flanking.

Blindsense 30 Feet (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Using nonvisual senses such as acute smell or hearing, members of this race notice things they cannot see. Members of this race usually do not need to make Perception checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within 30 feet, provided they have line of effect to that creature. A creature that members of this race cannot see still has total concealment against individuals with blindsense, and members of this race still have the normal miss chance when attacking creatures that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of members of this race. Members of this race are still denied their Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks from creatures they cannot see.
