There are only a few low-level divination spells specifically related to wilderness environments. Characters often ignore these spells, and instead they rely on class abilities or skills to replicate their effects. Introducing NPCs with access to these spells can highlight their utility to PCs who might otherwise see these spells as extraneous.

<a href="spelldisplay4355.html?ItemName=Detect%20Animals%20or%20Plants">Detect Animals or Plants</a>: This spell has a much larger range than <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a>, beginning with a minimum area of a 440-foot cone. This spell also requires thinking of a specific kind of animal or plant, making it very specialized in its application. Further, it grants the caster the ability to see the current condition of a target, rather than just a sense of the creature's total power. A handy application of this spell is to monitor the health of allies, such as animal companions or plant creatures such as <a href="racesdisplaya15c.html?ItemName=Ghoran">ghorans</a> and <a href="racesdisplay427d.html?ItemName=Vine%20Leshy">vine leshys</a>.

<a href="spelldisplaycf6d.html?ItemName=Detect%20Snares%20and%20Pits">Detect Snares and Pits</a>: As a concentration effect, this spell is more useful in low-stress situations. It cuts down on some of the monotony of having PCs attempt repeated Perception checks, but the spell's specific detection parameters mean that some skill checks are still required.
