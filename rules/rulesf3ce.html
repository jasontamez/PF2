The following section includes armor and shields with unusual powers and magical abilities. Magic armor can have abilities that need to be activated to function or powers that work passively and constantly.

Armageddon Plate

Slot armor; CL 5th; Weight 50 lbs.
Aura faint transmutation; Price 2,650 gp; Scaling wonder

Description

A suit of armageddon plate acts as +1 full plate for nearly any wearer-it automatically resizes when donned to fit wearers of size Small to Large. The armor is blackened, with joints and helm in a style reminiscent of the legendary tarrasque.
6th Level: Armageddon plate is +1 <a href="magicarmordisplay7af0.html?ItemName=Fortification%20(light)">light fortification</a> full plate.
8th Level: Armageddon plate retaliates against melee attackers when its fortification ability triggers. When an attacker strikes the wearer with a melee weapon and the armor negates a critical hit or sneak attack, the power of the armor leaves the attacker shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and can stack with itself to make an attacker frightened or panicked.
11th Level: Armageddon plate is +1 moderate fortification full plate.
13th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 moderate fortification full plate. The save DC of its fear effect increases to 20, and it affects attackers who use both ranged and melee weapons.
16th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 moderate fortification full plate of <a href="magicarmordisplaya65a.html?ItemName=Invulnerability">invulnerability</a>. Armageddon plate grants DR 5/- instead of DR 5/magic.
18th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 moderate fortification adamantine full plate of <a href="magicarmordisplay6bdc.html?ItemName=Determination">determination</a> and invulnerability. The damage reduction from adamantine stacks with the modified invulnerability effect for a total of DR 8/-.
20th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 heavy fortification adamantine full plate of determination and invulnerability. Once per day, the wearer can lengthen the spines of the armor and release a volley of six spines as a full-attack action, all at the wearer's highest base attack bonus with a range increment of 120 feet. Each spine that hits deals 2d10 damage + the wearer's Strength bonus. If the spines attack multiple targets, all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Once per day, the wearer can change her base land speed to 150 feet for 1 round as a free action. If she chooses to do so, she does not apply any other modifications that increase her movement speed for that round.

Aura strong abjuration; Price 28,557 gp; Scaling prize

Description

This +1 heavy wooden shield is covered in stretched dragonhide and reinforced with petrified plates carved from a dragon's thickest scales. A dragonshield's enhancement bonus to AC increases by 1 against any creature with the dragon type, or by 2 against a dragon of the specific type used in the creation of the dragonshield.
