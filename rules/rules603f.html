In general, civilization hinges on a people's ability to move beyond the hunter-gatherer model, to settle into a place, learn to understand, and it harness its resources. In most cases, this is the result of a primitive people first domesticating wild animals-either as hunting companions or as food, clothing, or milk sources' and learning to plant crops for survival. Many cultures eventually move on from that base, focusing instead on technological innovation, conquest, or higher magic.

Some, though, choose to live in harmony with the earth, to keep their heads down and their roots deep. These are the agrarian societies, and they can be found almost anywhere civilization spreads its cloak. Without the ability to grow large amounts of food, and without the aid of beasts of burden to speed agriculture and provide a richer, meat-based diet, most advanced societies could not exist: the citizens would be dependent on their own skills to raise food, and they would not have the energy or inclination to pursue other avenues of thought. After the invention of agriculture, however, more people can devote their lives to improving society as a whole: creating pots to store the food, refining processes to cure hides and create clothing, building more durable houses, and creating standardized currency to expedite trade.

In a realistic world, pastoralists might raise cattle, horses, sheep, or goats and farm wheat, lentils, barley, or maize'staples that provide labor, fiber, and food for a large number of people. In a high-fantasy world, they might raise more fantastic creatures, such as griffons, hippogriffs, or dire wolves. In either case, farmers and ranchers typically choose locations near rivers or lakes, which they can use to irrigate fields or water animals. If necessary, they often clear trees and brush from the area to create open fields or pastures.

Some broad agrarian settings include: <ul><li>The fertile farmlands outside a city, whose inhabitants are mocked by the same snobbish city folk who rely on them for survival. </li><li>Serfs toiling around the keep of a once-proud noble, who offers them protection. </li><li>Rural farmlands, feeding a distant empire embroiled in an ancient war. </li><li>A pastoral paradise far from urban society, where the citizens want for nothing. </li><li>A walled farm town, perched high on a peninsular bluff, defending its goods and lifestyle against pirates and raiders alike.</li></ul>

In most settled lands, there is a limited growing season. Whether this is because of harsh winters or blazing summers, lack of or too much water, or monster activity, farmers must plan well ahead to gain the most from their land. Near the equator, growing seasons tend to be longer, while near the poles, they're shorter. As continuous farming leaves the land poor in nutrients, farmers must figure out ways to improve the yield year after year. Whether by controlled burning, crop rotation, irrigation, or synergistic fertilization with domesticated animals, the members of an agrarian society must constantly and consistently ensure that their lands are fertile during the growing season, and that they produce as much as possible during that time.

Farmers must also always be prepared for floods, plagues, insect swarms, wildfires, storms, and other such natural disasters. Their entire livelihood-and their very survival- depends on storing food and preserving it against future disaster. As such, they often develop a stoic, fatalistic mindset, with a healthy appreciation of simple pleasures and hard work.

The demands of planting, harvesting, and caring for their animals means that farmers have precious little time or energy to work on magic or martial skills from spring to fall; such pursuits are almost exclusively saved for winter.

Agrarian communities are usually closely knit out of necessity, though there may be tension and antagonism among the members. Such societies require mutual cooperation to survive, and as a result, their interactions often revolve around group activities, such as a shared religious services or barn raisings.

When designing a rural or agrarian society, keep in mind some of the following basic questions about the people. <ul><li>How advanced are they technologically? </li><li>Where did these people originally come from, and why did they come? </li><li>What did they do when they arrived in this land? Were they friendly or antagonistic toward the creatures and people already here? </li><li>Did they bring seeds and animals from their homeland with them? </li><li>What terrain do they inhabit? </li><li>Who are their enemies and allies? </li><li>How fertile is the land? What happens to any excess crops that are harvested-are they traded or stockpiled against future shortages? </li><li>How do the farmers fertilize their land, and with what materials? (Examples: manure, compost, blood, corpses of enemies, magic, prayers.) </li><li>What is their primary food crop or animal? </li><li>What is their primary beast of burden? </li><li>How do they store their food? </li><li>Do they have currency, and if so, what is it? Who issues it, and by what authority? </li><li>What is the weather like, and what kinds of clothing do they wear? </li><li>How clean are they, and how do they maintain that level of hygiene? </li><li>How do they feel about magic and wizards? </li><li>What is their relationship with their gods? </li><li>What is their relationship with travelers, merchants, and other foreigners? </li><li>How do they protect their land? </li><li>What monsters and fey live near this society, and how do these people deal with them?</li>
