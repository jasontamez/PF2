If a creature with at least three natural attacks makes a full attack using only natural weapons, the creature has a maximum number of hits equal to the number of secondary attacks plus 1/2 the number of primary attacks (rounded up). The creature uses the lowest attack bonus of its primary natural weapons for its attack roll. For each hit it scores, the creature can choose to deal damage with any two primary natural weapons or any one secondary natural weapon. If it misses by 5 or less, it hits with one primary natural weapon instead of dealing a glancing blow.

For example, a monster with two primary claw attacks and a secondary tail slap can score up to two hits. If it scores one hit, it can apply both of its claws or its tail slap. If it misses by 5 or less, it can apply one of its claws. If it succeeds by 5 or more, scoring two hits, it can apply all three of its attacks.
