If this event recounts accomplishments of another PC or NPC, you and the subject gain 2 honor points each. If the event mocks the subject and the subject has fewer honor points than you, you gain 2 honor points and the subject loses 2. If the event mocks a target with more honor points than you, you risk the -4 slander penalty if the event can be associated with you. Each additional subject the event would praise or mock gives the skill check a -5 penalty.
2 The oath must be to someone with more honor points than you.
3 Unless this is part of a class ability that requires you to brag about your accomplishments.
