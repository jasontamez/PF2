A character who chooses <a href="classdisplay1bca.html?ItemName=Witch">witch</a> as her secondary class gains the following secondary class features.

Patron: At 1st level, she chooses a <a href="witchpatrons.html">patron</a>. She never qualifies for the <a href="featdisplaya900.html?ItemName=Extra%20Hex">Extra Hex</a> feat.

Witch's Familiar: At 3rd level, she gains a <a href="classdisplay477d.html?ItemName=Familiar">familiar</a>, treating her character level as her effective witch level.

Hex: At 7th level, she gains a <a href="witchhexes.html">hex</a> of her choice as a 1st-level witch. If she chooses the slumber hex, it can affect only creatures with Hit Dice less than or equal to her character level.

Cantrip: At 11th level, if she has an Intelligence score of 10 or higher, she chooses a witch cantrip and can cast that cantrip as a spell-like ability at will. She uses her character level as the caster level and Intelligence as the cantrip's key ability score.

Improved Hex: At 15th level, she gains a second hex as a 1st-level witch, and her first hex advances as if she were an 8th-level witch.

Major Hex: At 19th level, she gains a major hex as a 10th-level witch. She cannot gain the ice tomb hex.
