Armageddon Plate

Slot armor; CL 5th; Weight 50 lbs.
Aura faint transmutation; Price 2,650 gp; Scaling wonder

Description

A suit of armageddon plate acts as +1 full plate for nearly any wearer-it automatically resizes when donned to fit wearers of size Small to Large. The armor is blackened, with joints and helm in a style reminiscent of the legendary tarrasque.
6th Level: Armageddon plate is +1 <a href="magicarmordisplay7af0.html?ItemName=Fortification%20(light)">light fortification</a> full plate.
8th Level: Armageddon plate retaliates against melee attackers when its fortification ability triggers. When an attacker strikes the wearer with a melee weapon and the armor negates a critical hit or sneak attack, the power of the armor leaves the attacker shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and can stack with itself to make an attacker frightened or panicked.
11th Level: Armageddon plate is +1 moderate fortification full plate.
13th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 moderate fortification full plate. The save DC of its fear effect increases to 20, and it affects attackers who use both ranged and melee weapons.
16th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 moderate fortification full plate of <a href="magicarmordisplaya65a.html?ItemName=Invulnerability">invulnerability</a>. Armageddon plate grants DR 5/- instead of DR 5/magic.
18th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 moderate fortification adamantine full plate of <a href="magicarmordisplay6bdc.html?ItemName=Determination">determination</a> and invulnerability. The damage reduction from adamantine stacks with the modified invulnerability effect for a total of DR 8/-.
20th Level: Armageddon plate is +2 heavy fortification adamantine full plate of determination and invulnerability. Once per day, the wearer can lengthen the spines of the armor and release a volley of six spines as a full-attack action, all at the wearer's highest base attack bonus with a range increment of 120 feet. Each spine that hits deals 2d10 damage + the wearer's Strength bonus. If the spines attack multiple targets, all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. Once per day, the wearer can change her base land speed to 150 feet for 1 round as a free action. If she chooses to do so, she does not apply any other modifications that increase her movement speed for that round.

The following section includes weapons with unusual powers and magical abilities. Magic weapons can have abilities that need to be activated to function or powers that work passively and constantly.

Legacy Arrow

Slot none; CL 4th; Weight 1/10 lb.
Aura faint transmutation; Price 305 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

This ornately carved arrow always survives being fired. By concentrating as a standard action, the last person to shoot the arrow can sense the direction in which it lies, up to a distance of 1 mile. This effect fades 24 hours after firing. Initially, a legacy arrow acts merely as a masterwork arrow, but it always retains its ability to survive and be recovered after use. Legacy arrows can be found as other sorts of ammunition, including bolts, shuriken, sling bullets, and even firearm bullets.
6th Level: The arrow has the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay2c40.html?ItemName=Distance">distance</a> special ability, normally not available to ammunition. When fired, it loses this weapon special ability and any gained at higher levels for 1 day.

14th Level: Once per day as a standard action, the arrow's wielder can designate it as a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">bane</a> arrow for a category of her choice. It retains its current bane properties until they are changed. The arrow still takes 10 minutes to regain the use of bane, as usual.
16th Level: The arrow retains its bane, distance, and seeking special abilities after being fired.
18th Level: Once per week, the wielder can take a standard action to fire the arrow, giving it the properties of a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5759.html?ItemName=Slaying%20Arrow%20(greater)">greater slaying arrow</a> (keyed to the same category as its bane ability) in addition to its other special abilities. After being fired, the arrow loses all special abilities for 1 week.
20th Level: The greater slaying ability can be used once per day (after which the arrow loses all special abilities for 1 day) rather than once per week. The arrow overcomes damage reduction as though adamantine.

Ring of the Trickster

Slot ring; CL 4th; Weight -
Aura faint illusion; Price 1,080 gp; Scaling prize

Description

This five-piece puzzle ring must be properly assembled before it can be placed on a finger. Once per day as a move action, the wearer can create a single <a href="spelldisplay70a5.html?ItemName=mirror%20image">mirror image</a> as if using the <a href="domaindisplay3da5.html?ItemName=Trickery">Trickery domain's copycat power</a>. If the wearer is a cleric with the Trickery domain and the copycat power, she instead gains two additional uses of that ability.
6th Level: The wearer can use <a href="spelldisplay1bac.html?ItemName=prestidigitation">prestidigitation</a> at will.
8th Level: By spending 1 full round reconfiguring the ring's puzzle, the wearer can find a way to solve the puzzle with four of the pieces while twisting the final piece into a tiny shape that grows into another simple object. Treat the result as if the wearer had reconfigured a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay10fd.html?FinalName=Traveler's%20Any-Tool">traveler's any-tool</a>, except that the resulting object additionally grants a +2 competence bonus on a skill check of the wearer's choice that could conceivably involve the object. As long as she does not lose the object, the wearer can return the fifth piece to the ring by spending another full round. The wearer cannot use any of the ring's creation powers without all five pieces.
10th Level: By spending 1 minute reconfiguring the ring's puzzle, the wearer can find a way to solve the puzzle with four of the pieces while twisting the final piece into a tiny shape that grows into a new object as <a href="spelldisplayfcb7.html?ItemName=minor%20creation">minor creation</a>, except that the wearer uses Disable Device rather than Craft to create a complex object. The fifth piece of the ring mysteriously reappears 24 hours after the new object vanishes. The wearer cannot use any of the ring's creation powers without all five pieces.
12th Level: By spending 10 minutes reconfiguring the ring's puzzle, the wearer can find a way to solve the puzzle with four of the pieces while twisting the final piece into a tiny shape that grows into a new object as <a href="spelldisplay36ee.html?ItemName=major%20creation">major creation</a>, except that the wearer uses Disable Device rather than Craft to create a complex object. The fifth piece mysteriously reappears 24 hours after the new object vanishes. The wearer cannot use any of the ring's creation powers without all five pieces.

Rods are scepterlike devices that have unique magical powers and usually do not have any charges. Anyone can use a rod.

Mimetic Rod

Slot none; CL 7th; Weight 2 lbs.
Aura moderate divination; Price 1,350 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

The smooth surface of this rod is polished to a mirror sheen. Two cabochons-one amber and one viridian'set into the ends of the rod control its functions. A creature can press the viridian stone and roll the rod across a piece of writing on a flat surface to copy that writing into the rod, leaving the original text intact. By pressing the amber cabochon and rolling the rod across a different flat surface, a creature can replicate the original text. The text remains stored in the rod until the viridian stone is pressed again. The rod can copy a text the size of its surface area: 10 inches by 12 inches. Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook. The rod can't copy traps that use magical writing, such as <a href="spelldisplay021c.html?ItemName=explosive%20runes">explosive runes</a>, but attempting to do so doesn't trigger the trap unless the movement of the magic item over the text would normally trigger it.
9th Level: The rod can be used to copy faces. It must first be waved in front of either a person's actual face or a high-quality reproduction while the wielder presses the viridian cabochon. The stored face can then be replicated over someone else's face as though they-d been affected by <a href="spelldisplay5465.html?ItemName=disguise%20self">disguise self</a> (though this can change only the face-not height, weight, or other features). This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level possessed by the person activating the rod (to a maximum of 140 minutes). The rod can store only one face at a time, and can't store a face while it's storing text.
11th Level: If the rod's user speaks the name of a language, the rod automatically translates any text stored in it to that language. When that text is reproduced, it comes out in the language it has been translated to. A piece of text can be translated any number of times while stored in the rod.
14th Level: The rod can copy and reproduce magical traps that rely on text, including symbols. The rod's user must succeed at a caster level check (caster level 14th) with a DC equal to 11 + the targeted spell's caster level to do so. If she succeeds, the trap is stored harmlessly in the rod and can be replicated just as text would. Unlike with normal text, the spell is erased from inside the rod when it's replicated. The size of the rod's surface area doesn't limit the size of magical trap text it can copy. When the rod reproduces the magical writing, any decisions made by the original caster are unchanged. The rod's wielder can also press the viridian cabochon to harmlessly extinguish the spell instead of reproducing it.

Rod of the Deadlord

Slot none; CL 9th; Weight 4 lbs.
Aura moderate necromancy; Price 16,005 gp; Scaling wonder

Description

This baton and the small skull that tops it are both made of blackened adamantine. The rod can be wielded as a +1 <a href="magicweaponsdisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=Conductive">conductive</a> light mace. At the wielder's command, it transforms into a morningstar, heavy mace, flail, or heavy flail. It returns to its normal shape if left unattended for 1 round. Commanders of undead legions often wield such rods as symbols of authority. Changing the weapon's type can be used to signal a change in strategy for the undead horde, with the mace indicating a steady march, the morningstar calling for an aggressive assault, a flail indicating a retreat, and so on.
11th Level: The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +2.
13th Level: Any creature hit by the rod of the deadlord gains a temporary negative level. The target avoids this negative level if it succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 6 + the wielder's Hit Dice (maximum 21). This negative level lasts for 12 hours, and can't become a permanent negative level.
15th Level: If the wielder confirms a critical hit, instead of gaining a temporary negative level the target gains a permanent negative level with no saving throw. Each day thereafter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (using the same DC as the 13th-level unlockable ability) or acquire another negative level. This is a curse effect that continues until removed (DC 23) or until the target dies. A target slain by this curse cannot be revived from death until the curse is removed.
17th Level: The rod's enhancement bonus increases to +3. Once per day, the rod's owner can tap the rod on the ground as a standard action to duplicate the effects of <a href="spelldisplay4c3e.html?ItemName=animate%20dead">animate dead</a>. The total HD of undead the owner can control in this way is equal to her level. If she controls other undead from castings of <a href="spelldisplay4c3e.html?ItemName=animate%20dead">animate dead</a>, she uses only the highest maximum she can control-the values do not stack. She ceases to control undead created by the rod if the rod leaves her possession.

Wondrous items are diverse. Some must be worn in a specific magic item slot in order to work, while others must merely be possessed and used. "Wondrous item" is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into other groups, such as weapons, staves, and so on. Anyone can use a wondrous item, unless the item specifies otherwise. There are two main categories of wondrous items: slotted and slotless. Slotted items take up a magic item slot, and must be worn by those who want to benefit from them.

After each use of this ability, the wearer must wait for at least as long as the <a href="spelldisplayd685.html?ItemName=fly">fly</a> effect lasted until using this ability again.
12th Level: For each daily use of <a href="spelldisplayd685.html?ItemName=fly">fly</a>, the wearer can instead choose to transform into an ordinary bat as <a href="spelldisplaydb5b.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20III">beast shape III</a> for the same duration.

Beaker of Plentiful Poisons

Slot none; CL 7th; Weight 1 lb.
Aura moderate conjuration; Price 3,600 gp; Scaling prize

Description

This flared and stoppered flask of tempered glass can store up to 5 doses of poison, all of which can be different types. The owner can craft up to 5 doses of poison simultaneously using the beaker. She must still attempt separate Craft (alchemy) checks for each dose of poison to ensure successful crafting, but she can make progress on all five poisons simultaneously (making checks for the week's or day's progress at the same time).

The user can also add already-completed doses of poison to the beaker. All poisons remain separate and unmixed as long as they remain within the beaker, and the user can decant any of the poisons (including incomplete poisons) by naming the poison she wishes to pour forth.
9th Level: When crafting a poison within the beaker, the crafter uses the poison's gp value instead of its sp value when determining her progress.
11th Level: Once per day, the owner of a beaker of plentiful poisons can produce 1 additional dose of any completed poison stored in the flask. The additional dose loses its efficacy 1 minute after being decanted. The market price of the duplicated poison can't exceed an amount equal to 20 gp ?? the beaker's caster level; any unused value is lost. A creature must have had the beaker of plentiful poisons in its possession for at least 24 hours to create poisons in this way.
13th Level: The beaker can create 2 doses of poison per day, with a total market price up to 40 gp ?? the beaker's caster level.
15th Level: The beaker can create 3 doses of poison per day, with a total market price of up to 60 gp ?? the beaker's caster level.

These coarse, heavy boots are fitted with numerous iron plates and rusted spikes that give them an intimidating appearance. The wearer can use brutish boots to attack as if using a masterwork cold iron gauntlet or masterwork cold iron spiked gauntlet, depending on which portion of the boot he uses.

These boots also protect the wearer's feet as if they had hardness 8.

Crystal Tiara

Slot head; CL 3rd; Weight -
Aura faint conjuration; Price 1,000 gp; Scaling wonder

Description

This elaborate tiara looks as though it's made of intricately carved ice adorned with small, crystalline gemstones. Despite the item's fragile appearance, it has hardness 12 and 10 hit points. Its wearer gains the constant effects of <a href="spelldisplay2b11.html?ItemName=endure%20elements">endure elements</a> against cold conditions only.
5th Level: Once per day, the wearer can summon a <a href="monsterdisplay4ceb.html?ItemName=Small%20Ice%20Elemental">Small ice elemental</a> as <a href="spelldisplay72b3.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%202">summon monster II</a>.
7th Level: As a standard action, the wearer can launch an icicle at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged attack. On a hit, the icicle deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage. In addition, the wearer can walk across icy ground without slipping.
10th Level: As part of her move action, the wearer can step into the air, creating crystalline stairs beneath her feat, adding new steps in whichever direction she travels. These steps melt away behind her. If others try to climb the steps, they crumble away, leaving only the portions beneath the wearer's feet intact. This otherwise acts as the <a href="spelldisplay274d.html?ItemName=air%20walk">air walk</a> spell. She can use this ability each day for 10 minutes per level, divided any way she chooses in 10-minute intervals.
12th Level: Once per day, the wearer can call forth an <a href="spelldisplay88d2.html?ItemName=ice%20storm">ice storm</a>. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can summon either 1d4 Small ice elementals or one <a href="monsterdisplay212e.html?ItemName=Medium%20Ice%20Elemental">Medium ice elemental</a> as <a href="spelldisplay5568.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%204">summon monster IV</a>.

16th Level: The wearer can use the tiara to call up a tower of ice, as an <a href="magicwondrousdisplay9069.html?FinalName=Instant%20Fortress">instant fortress</a> (except that the tiara does not transform into the tower, the tower takes 1 minute to rise instead of 1 round, the walls of the tower have only hardness 12, and damage to the tower does not carry over between multiple uses of this ability).
18th Level: When the wearer calls forth a tower of ice, if there is enough open space, she can choose to call forth a small palace instead, 100 feet square at the base with 20-foot-high rooms, with a central tower 20 feet square and 100 feet high. At will, she can spend 5 rounds to transform into a flurry of snowflakes that can move at incredible speed. Treat this as <a href="spelldisplay3134.html?ItemName=wind%20walk">wind walk</a> except she gains vulnerability to fire. It normally takes 5 rounds to transform back into her normal shape. However, she can revert to her original form early as a standard action. If she does so, she cannot transform into snowflakes again for 24 hours. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can choose to summon 1d4+1 Medium ice elementals, 1d3 Large ice elementals, or one <a href="monsterdisplay384d.html?ItemName=Huge%20Ice%20Elemental">Huge ice elemental</a> as <a href="spelldisplay4fc5.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%206">summon monster VI</a>.

When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can also choose to summon 1d4+1 Huge ice elementals, 1d3 <a href="monsterdisplayf15a.html?ItemName=Greater%20Ice%20Elemental">greater ice elementals</a>, or one <a href="monsterdisplaya86b.html?ItemName=Elder%20Ice%20Elemental">elder ice elemental</a> as <a href="spelldisplay56ca.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%208">summon monster VIII</a>. She can create ice stairs without a daily limit, and if she wishes, they last for 1 minute before melting, even if another creature tries to climb them. If she chooses to make them last longer, she can dismiss the stairs behind her as a swift action, potentially causing creatures climbing the stairs to fall.

Eternal Feather Token

Slot none; CL 4th; Weight -
Aura faint conjuration; Price 2,650 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

This small, colorful feather waves gently as if blown by a constant breeze. As a standard action, the feather's owner can change its form into another variety of <a href="magicwondrousdisplaycd1a.html?FinalName=Feather%20TokenAnchor">feather token</a>. Any owner can use an eternal feather token to duplicate the effects of an anchor feather token. Higher-level owners have additional options. The token remains transformed until its owner commands it to change again, or until it is activated in that form like a normal feather token.

Filthy Rags

Slot body; CL 8th; Weight 6 lbs.
Aura moderate necromancy; Price 5,000 gp; Scaling prize

Description

These ragged robes are threadbare and frayed, caked with dirt and grime. Through constant exposure to innocuous forms of disease, the wearer becomes inured to sickness and filth, gaining a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws versus disease and effects that cause the nauseated or sickened condition. Filthy rags can be worn in conjunction with armor.
10th Level: The rags begin to crawl with insects and spiders, granting the wearer familiarity with the feeling of tiny creatures crawling over her body. After wearing the rags for 24 consecutive hours, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the distraction ability of swarms. Once per day, she can make the spiders in her rags swarm out and attack her foes, causing the rags to expel spiders as the spell <a href="spelldisplayd1f3-2.html?ItemName=vomit%20swarm">vomit swarm</a>.
11th Level: Wasps build a small hive somewhere in the rags' interior. When the wearer uses <a href="spelldisplayd1f3-2.html?ItemName=vomit%20swarm">vomit swarm</a>, she can choose between spiders and wasps.
13th Level: The rags' diseases become more communicable. Any living creature striking the wearer with a bite attack contracts <a href="diseases80c3.html?ItemName=Filth%20Fever">filth fever</a>. A successful DC 14 Fortitude negates the disease. Oozes and vermin are immune to this effect, as are creatures such as <a href="monsterdisplayf7ff.html?ItemName=Otyugh">otyughs</a> and rats that are at home in exceptional filth.
16th Level: Army ants build a colony within the rags, and the rags' filth becomes utterly vile. The wearer can also choose army ants when using <a href="spelldisplayd1f3-2.html?ItemName=vomit%20swarm">vomit swarm</a>. Any biting creature that fails its saving throw against the rags' filth fever becomes nauseated for 1d4 rounds, and even on a successful save, the creature is still sickened for 1 round.

Flask of Reconcoction

Slot none; CL 4th; Weight -
Aura faint conjuration and divination; Price 2,650 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

This thin silver flask can hold a single ounce of liquid. If a potion of a 1st-level spell is poured into the flask, the flask's interior analyzes and bonds to that potion. Once the potion is drunk, the flask begins to hiss and bubble, as strange liquids and reagents slowly mix within it. After 1 full week, the flask has produced a new potion of the same 1st-level spell at minimum caster level. If anyone drinks or empties the flask before the week is over, they gain no benefit, the nascent potion is lost, and the flask ceases concocting until it is filled with a new 1st-level potion. If a potion in the flask is poured out of the flask, rather than drunk directly from it, the flask does not reconcoct that potion.
6th Level: The flask takes only 1 day to reconcoct a 1st-level potion, rather than 1 week.
8th Level: The flask can reconcoct a potion of a 2nd-level spell, but it takes 1 week.
10th Level: The flask takes only 1 day to reconcoct a 2ndlevel potion, rather than 1 week.
12th Level: The flask can reconcoct a potion of a 3rd-level spell, but it takes 1 week.
14th Level: The flask takes only 1 day to reconcoct a 3rd-level potion, rather than 1 week.

Force Bracers

Slot wrists; CL 8th; Weight 2 lbs.
Aura moderate evocation; Price 5,950 gp; Scaling prize

Description

These crystal-accented bracers are bound with metallic straps and a fine lacework of embedded wire. The wearer can cause the bracers to create a shield of force to protect him. Each bracer can create a shield for up to 10 total minutes per day. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments. If only one force bracer is used, it creates a buckler, light shield, or heavy shield of force. If the wearer activates both force bracers, the shield of force is the equivalent of a tower shield.

Regardless of which type of force shield is created, the shield is weightless and has only half the normal armor check penalty, but otherwise follows all of the normal rules for shield use and proficiency. The shield grants the corresponding shield bonus to AC. Because the shield is made of force, its bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks.
10th Level: If the wearer has created a heavy shield of force, the wearer can expend 1 minute of the shield's duration to make a single shield bash attack as if the shield had the <a href="magicarmordisplay0991.html?ItemName=Bashing%%bashing</a>%20shield%20special%20ability,%20with%20an%20enhancement%20bonus%20on%20the%20attack%20roll%20equal%20to%201/4%20the%20wearer%e2%80%99s%20Hit%20Dice%20(maximum%20+5).%20<br%20/>12th%20Level:%20If%20the%20wearer%20has%20created%20a%20tower%20shield%20of%20force,%20the%20wearer%20can%20release%20the%20tower%20shield%20from%20his%20person%20and%20use%20it%20as%20a%20<a%20style=">forceful hand</a> with hit points equal to 1/2 the wearer's hit points. The wearer gains none of the benefits of using a tower shield while the <a href="spelldisplayeed4.html?ItemName=forceful%20hand">forceful hand</a> exists.

Forgemaster's Gauntlets

Slot hands; CL 7th; Weight 4 lbs.
Aura moderate abjuration; Price 3,750 gp; Scaling prize

Description

These scorched gauntlets of heavy padded leather are reinforced with metallic mesh and ceramic pads to diffuse heat. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft (armor) and Craft (weapons) checks.
8th Level: The wearer can use <a href="spelldisplayce07.html?ItemName=spark">spark</a> at will.
10th Level: The wearer gains fire resistance 5, and her hands are immune to fire damage, so she can pick up hot objects or touch flames without being harmed. Weapons affected by <a href="spelldisplaycfa3.html?ItemName=heat%20metal">heat metal</a> or similar effects deal no damage to the wearer, and the wearer likewise ignores damage from effects like <a href="spelldisplay2025.html?ItemName=fire%20shield">fire shield</a> (hot flames version) that deal fire damage to a creature attacking in melee.
11th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 gauntlets.
12th Level: The wearer of the forgemaster's gauntlets can heat objects she touches. She can use <a href="spelldisplaycfa3.html?ItemName=heat%20metal">heat metal</a> (DC 13) at will. If she's targeting a metal object worn by a foe, she must succeed at a melee touch attack. If the targeted item is being held or wielded, the wearer of the forgemaster's gauntlets must attempt a combat maneuver check as if she were attempting to sunder the item. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the wearer does not have the <a href="featdisplay2c99.html?ItemName=Improved%20Sunder">Improved Sunder</a> feat.
13th Level: The wearer's fire resistance increases to 10.

Fruitful Sash

Slot belt; CL 5th; Weight 1 lb.
Aura faint conjuration; Price 710 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

This colorful sash seems to be the sort normally worn by any common sailor or traveler, yet within its folds is a bountiful pocket. The wearer can reach into this hidden pocket and remove a piece of fruit a number of times per day equal to his character level. The type of fruit varies. One piece of fruit has enough nourishment and water to sustain one humanoid for 24 hours.

After 24 hours, the fruit rots and cannot nourish anyone. Once removed from its wearer, the sash doesn't produce fruit for anyone else for 24 hours. If redonned by its most recent wearer during that time, the sash resumes function normally (and the amount of fruit remaining within it isn't reset).
6th Level: Consuming a fruit produced from the sash cures a creature of 1 point of damage as if it were a <a href="spelldisplaydb1f.html?ItemName=goodberry">goodberry</a>. A given creature can recover a maximum of 8 hit points in this way in a 24-hour period.
8th Level: Three times per day, the wearer can draw forth a large, ripe piece of healing fruit that explodes when thrown. This functions as a splash weapon, but cures a target it hits of 1d6 points of damage and cures each creature it splashes on of 1 point of damage. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.

These gloves are woven of a fine copper mesh and wire, and infuse the wearer's hands with an electric charge. The wearer can use the galvanic gauntlets to make a melee touch attack dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage. She gains a +3 bonus on the attack if the target is wearing metal armor or is composed of metal.
7th Level: The touch attack's damage increases to 2d6 points of electricity damage.
9th Level: If the wearer uses her hands to make unarmed strikes (including when making a combat maneuver check to damage an opponent in a grapple), those attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage on each hit, as if she were using a weapon with the <a href="magicweaponsdisplayf62f.html?ItemName=Shock">shock</a> weapon special ability.
11th Level: Any item held in the wearer's hands gains a powerful static charge, and any creature attempting to disarm the wearer of an object she is holding (or to make a steal combat maneuver against the gloves themselves) takes 1d6 points of electrical damage and must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the shock. This static charge does not harm items the wearer is holding.
13th Level: The shock ability of the gauntlets improves to the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay4179.html?ItemName=Shocking%20Burst">shocking burst</a> weapon special ability.

12th Level: The wearer can improve someone's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy. When she uses Intimidate to influence someone, she can present herself as glorious and powerful without threatening them, causing the attempt to operate like a Diplomacy check to influence instead.
14th Level: When the wearer uses the gorget's <a href="spelldisplay623c.html?ItemName=good%20hope">good hope</a> ability, it lasts 1 additional round for every 10 by which her result exceeds the Perform (oratory) check DC.

Heart of the Elder Tree

Slot neck; CL 9th; Weight -
Aura moderate transmutation; Price 14,000 gp; Scaling wonder

Description

This carved darkwood amulet resembles a human heart. As a move action while standing on earth, stone, or wood, its wearer can sprout woody, rootlike tendrils from his legs that anchor his feet to the ground. While so anchored, he gains a +4 bonus to his CMD against bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, trip, and other combat maneuvers that would force him from his space, as well as on saving throws against effects that would force him from his space on a failed save. The roots fall away if the wearer moves from his space, even involuntarily.
11th Level: When anchored to the ground, the wearer's roots interfere with adjacent foes. Foes adjacent to the wearer must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save each round or be entangled by the roots as if by the spell <a href="spelldisplaye879.html?ItemName=entangle">entangle</a>. If the wearer's roots fall away due to movement, all entangled enemies are immediately released.
13th Level: When struck by a nonliving wooden or woodenhafted weapon of Huge size or smaller, the wearer can lash back and affect that weapon with <a href="spelldisplay5e58.html?ItemName=warp%20wood">warp wood</a> as an immediate action (Will DC 20 negates). This ability is usable three times per day.
15th Level: The wearer can make a secondary natural attack with his roots, dealing an amount of damage equal to 1d4 + 1/2 the user's Strength bonus. At the beginning of the wearer's turn, if he still possesses roots from a previous round, the secondary root attack gains 5 feet of reach. This increase stacks with itself to a maximum of triple the wearer's natural reach, but it doesn't stack with any other increases. The reach resets whenever the roots fall away.
17th Level: The wearer gains the <a href="umr24c5.html?ItemName=Pull">pull (root, 10 feet)</a> universal monster ability.
20th Level: As long as the wearer's roots are planted in the ground, he gains the effect of a <a href="magicringsdisplayaf85.html?FinalName=Ring%20of%20Regeneration">ring of regeneration</a>. When the roots fall away, it counts as removing the ring, so he only regenerates damage taken after planting the roots and before moving. As long as the wearer activates his roots for at least 8 hours each day, he does not need to sleep. The wearer's +4 bonus on saving throws for planting his roots now also applies to paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stun.

15th Level: The saddle's bonuses on saving throws and to AC increase to +3. When the rider commands the saddle to grant his mount temporary hit points, the rider also gains a number of temporary hit points equal to half the amount his mount gains.

Description

This small pendant of brass and glass is crafted in the shape of a lantern and continuously sheds light as a <a href="spelldisplay9f2d.html?ItemName=light">light</a> spell. As a move action, the wearer can open the miniature lantern pendant and direct the tiny phantasmal fire within to float to any point within 110 feet. This functions as <a href="spelldisplay2d50.html?ItemName=dancing%20lights">dancing lights</a>, but the wearer can create a number of lights equal to 1/2 his character level, up to a maximum of four, and can create only torchlike lights, not glowing spheres or humanoid shapes. While the <a href="spelldisplay2d50.html?ItemName=dancing%20lights">dancing lights</a> are active, the light of the lantern pendant itself is extinguished.
6th Level: Once per day, the wearer can command the phantasmal fire to fly forth and limn all creatures in an area as <a href="spelldisplaya9c5.html?ItemName=faerie%20fire">faerie fire</a>. Just as when using <a href="spelldisplay2d50.html?ItemName=dancing%20lights">dancing lights</a>, the pendant's light is extinguished throughout the duration.
8th Level: The wearer can choose between <a href="spelldisplaya9c5.html?ItemName=faerie%20fire">faerie fire</a> and <a href="spelldisplayc127.html?ItemName=glitterdust">glitterdust</a> (Will DC 13) when he uses the 6th-level ability.
10th Level: Once per day, the wearer can focus the lantern's power, causing its light to increase from the <a href="spelldisplay9f2d.html?ItemName=light">light</a> spell to the <a href="spelldisplay0c31.html?ItemName=daylight">daylight</a> spell, with a duration as <a href="spelldisplay0c31.html?ItemName=daylight">daylight</a>. The <a href="spelldisplay0c31.html?ItemName=daylight">daylight</a> is suppressed whenever he activates any other ability that extinguishes the pendant's light, but such time still counts against its duration.
13th Level: Once per day, the wearer can release the lantern's lights in the form of <a href="spelldisplay4c57.html?ItemName=wandering%20star%20motes">wandering star motes</a> (Will DC 16). During the duration, the pendant's light is extinguished.

Mark of the Grinning Skull

Slot headband; CL 8th; Weight 1 lb.
Aura moderate necromancy; Price 2,000 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

An ebony skull adorns this tarnished silver band. When the wearer successfully demoralizes a creature with an Intimidate check, the penalties for being shaken increase by 2 on checks and rolls involving the wearer. For example, attacks made against the wearer and saves against her spells would take a -4 penalty rather than a -2 penalty.
11th Level: Once per day, the wearer can attempt to frighten a creature with an Intimidate check instead of demoralizing it. She must declare she is doing so before attempting the Intimidate check. The penalty increase for checks and rolls involving the wearer also applies if the creature is frightened in this way.
14th Level: The wearer can attempt to demoralize opponents as a move action instead of as a standard action. If the wearer can already do so because of the intimidating glare barbarian power or a similar ability, she can instead demoralize opponents as a swift action.

On command, the mantle glows in delicate <a href="spelldisplaya9c5.html?ItemName=faerie%20fire">faerie fire</a> of any color of the wearer's choice, and a second command word ends the glow.
8th Level: The mantle magnifies and sharpens the wearer's beauty such that her +4 competence bonus now applies on all Charisma checks, Charisma-based skill checks, and Sense Motive checks against any creature. Against fey, the bonus increases to +6.

Whenever she converses with creatures, she can insert a <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> (Will DC 14 negates) for every 10 minutes of conversation by succeeding at a DC 14 Perform (oratory) check.

12th Level: Once per day, the wearer can release the glow within the mantle in a single coruscating burst of color. This blinds creatures in a 10-foot radius (Reflex DC 19 negates) for 1d4 rounds and completely dispels any darkness spells of 6th level or lower whose source is within its area.
14th Level: The wearer grows a pair of gossamer wings. The wings are delicate and weak, carrying the wearer only with difficulty. She gains a fly speed of 30 feet (poor maneuverability).

20th Level: The wearer's type changes to fey, and she gains DR 10/cold iron. If the wearer's type was already fey and she already possessed DR/cold iron, her DR increases by 10 and magic weapons with enhancement bonuses of +3 or greater do not count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing her DR.

Spectacles of Thought-Seeing

Slot eyes; CL 7th; Weight -
Aura moderate divination; Price 3,600 gp; Scaling prize

Description

The wearer of these ornate crystal lenses gains a +6 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks. When she uses Sense Motive to determine whether someone is lying to her, she gets a brief flash of the liar's thoughts at that instant.
9th Level: When the wearer concentrates, she can perceive the thoughts of a single creature as writing in the air, rendered in the subject's native language. This functions as though the wearer had concentrated on the creature for 3 rounds using <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a>, and can be blocked with a successful Will save with a DC equal to the wearer's character level + 6 (to a maximum DC of 20). A creature that succeeds at its save can't be affected again for 24 hours. Maintaining concentration requires a standard action each round (as for a spell), and once the wearer ceases concentrating on a creature, she cannot observe thoughts again for 1 minute. This ability can be used for a total of 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. The glasses fail to function against creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower or without a written language.
11th Level: The competence bonus on Sense Motive checks increases to +8. The <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a> effect can be used for 10 minutes per day. In addition to seeing the creature's thoughts in its native language, the wearer gets visual impressions of the creature's thoughts. She might see the face of someone the creature is thinking about, for instance, or see an image of that creature stabbing someone if it's planning an attack.
13th Level: The competence bonus on Sense Motive checks increases to +10. The <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a> effect is constant-the wearer no longer needs to concentrate to maintain it, and there is no longer a limit on the number of rounds per day.

Star of Vision

Slot eyes; CL 11th; Weight -
Aura moderate divination; Price 14,400 gp; Scaling prize

Description

When touched to an eye, this star-shaped gem affixes itself until willingly removed or pried from an unconscious wearer. On command, the wearer can share her vision of her surroundings with allies within 60 feet. This gives them the benefit of any special visual sense she has (such as <a href="spelldisplay99ef.html?ItemName=darkvision">darkvision</a> or <a href="spelldisplaybdc5.html?ItemName=see%20invisibility">see invisibility</a>) and even allows blind allies to see, assuming the wearer is not herself blind. This effect lasts for 1 minute, and once used, can't be activated again for 30 minutes. While the effect is active, an ally of the wearer can switch back and forth at will between sharing the wearer's vision and seeing through his own eyes.
12th Level: The shared senses effect lasts for 10 minutes. While sharing senses, the wearer automatically discovers the number and location of secret doors in a 60-foot cone in front of her, as though she had been studying the area for 2 rounds with <a href="spelldisplaycb54.html?ItemName=detect%20secret%20doors">detect secret doors</a>. (This effect doesn't grant any of the other benefits of <a href="spelldisplaycb54.html?ItemName=detect%20secret%20doors">detect secret doors</a>.)
14th Level: While sharing senses, the wearer gains the benefit of <a href="spelldisplaybdc5.html?ItemName=see%20invisibility">see invisibility</a>.
16th Level: Once per day, when the wearer activates the star of vision, she gains the benefit of <a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a> for the duration of the effect.

Slot none; CL 7th; Weight 1 lb.
Aura moderate divination; Price 1,250 gp; Scaling bauble

Description

This spyglass grants enhanced vision of celestial bodies and the movements of the cosmos in the dark of night.

She increases the spell's range by one category-from touch to close range, close to medium range, or medium to long range-without increasing the spell's level. This ability can be used once per night. Objects viewed through the spyglass are magnified to 8 times their size.
15th Level: The user can extend the range of the spell by two categories instead of one. Objects viewed through the spyglass are magnified to 10 times their size.

Vest of Golden Leaves

Slot chest; CL 6th; Weight 4 lbs.
Aura moderate transmutation; Price 2,400 gp; Scaling prize

Description

This garment is lined with gilded leaves, magically preserved in their autumnal splendor. The leaves retain this natural appearance in urban areas or natural settings other than forests or wooded areas. When the wearer is in a forest environment, the vest's leaves change to match the local flora. As long as the wearer moves no more than half her base speed in a given round, she gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks and can attempt Stealth checks without cover or concealment. Each time the wearer attacks, the leaves turn blood red, negating this effect for 1 minute.
8th Level: Once per day, the wearer can detach one of the leaves of the garment and send it floating toward a location she specifies, borne on the wind but otherwise identical in effect to an <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a>.
11th Level: Once per day, the wearer can either assume <a href="spelldisplayceba.html?ItemName=tree%20shape">tree shape</a> or transform herself into a cloud of leaves floating, falling, and swirling about in a mass the same size as the wearer's actual body. This leaf form is equivalent to <a href="spelldisplay1973.html?ItemName=gaseous%20form">gaseous form</a>, but the wearer also gains vulnerability to fire.
13th Level: The wearer can, in place of using either of the vest's 11th-level abilities, choose to release a number of leaves equal to 1/2 her Hit Dice as remote magical sensors. These leaves are identical in effect to <a href="spelldisplay999d.html?ItemName=prying%20eyes">prying eyes</a>, except that they have vulnerability to fire.
16th Level: The leaves warp and distort the wearer's location as <a href="spelldisplay14e2.html?ItemName=blur">blur</a>, providing a 20% miss chance.
20th Level: The wearer can step into any tree that possesses leaves and out of another tree of the same kind that also possesses leaves, as <a href="spelldisplaydc68.html?ItemName=tree%20stride">tree stride</a>. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Hit Dice.

Vest of Eldritch Preservation

Slot chest; CL 9th; Weight 1 lb.
Aura moderate abjuration; Price 8,000 gp; Scaling prize

Description

Woven of aranea silk, this vest grants potent protection against spells that would warp the wearer's mind or body. Its wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against curses, enchantments, and transmutations.
11th Level: Once per day, the wearer can remove the shaken or sickened condition from himself or an ally with a touch. This is a standard action, or a swift action if he cures himself. In addition, the wearer can't be compelled to keep a cursed item. This doesn't prevent the cursed item's effects, but does allow the wearer to freely discard the item.
13th Level: Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can use <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> against an effect that has just taken hold of him, even if the effect causes him to lose consciousness or control of his actions. Only a single effect can be targeted by this use of <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a>. This protection can be recharged by casting <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> on the vest.
15th Level: The conditions the wearer can remove with a touch now also include cursed (as <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a>), dazed, and frightened.
