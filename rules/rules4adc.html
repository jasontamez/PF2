Rumors of the corpses of strange creatures appearing for sale in the city are confirmed with the display of a brace of dead <a href="monsterdisplay4a88.html?ItemName=Imp">imps</a> in a local market. Where are they from, and why are they here?

Discovery: The characters overhear the rush of fear and excitement when the corpses of two imps appear for sale in a local bazaar. It is soon revealed that the source of the corpses is a local ragpicker with some knowledge of the occult, who discovered the imps discarded behind an old lodge building of a defunct fraternal society. Soon, another pair is discovered, and more pairs follow on its heels. What could be causing their appearance, and who is killing them two at a time?

Adversary: The imps are actually the messengers of a powerful devil once in league with the defunct secret society. A sorcerer recently took up residence in the old lodge, and the imps began appearing with tempting offerings from their diabolical master. The sorcerer slew the daily emissaries and disposed of their bodies. Their master is angered by the spellcaster's violent response to his daily demands, and soon more powerful forces well out of the sorcerer's league may appear to exact revenge. Can the PCs come to the sorcerer's aid, or are they already too late?

Further Adventures: The PCs may gain a new ally in the form of the sorcerer, or a powerful antagonist if she takes the devil's bargain. Does the ragpicker know more than he is willing to admit? What dark secrets does the lodge hold that the devil may seek for himself ?
