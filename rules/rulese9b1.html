While most gaming groups adhere to the basic convention of one player per character, there's no rule to prevent players from running multiple characters if you're comfortable with it. As mentioned earlier, the Leadership feat offers perhaps the most obvious option for this, potentially drawing a small army into a single character's employ. Yet there's nothing to say that a player can't play two totally independent PCs at once. This option is particularly useful for small groups that would otherwise have significant holes in their abilities and skill sets. In extreme cases, a game with only one player might see the player running an entire party.
