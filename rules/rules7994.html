You gain and lose honor points through events. Some events affect all PCs in the party (such as destroying a demon that's attacking a village), and others only affect you (such as losing a duel against a less honorable rival). Most of these events require witnesses who spread the word of what happened; if nobody outside sees the event, and nobody in the party speaks of it, it has no effect on your honor. The GM may decide that a delay of 1d6 days or more is appropriate for a change in honor, reflecting the time needed for news to travel.

A single event can earn you honor points for multiple reasons. For example, if you're a paladin using the chivalric code and your party's APL is 8, defeating a CR 11 hezrou demon earns everyone in the party 1 honor point for the "party overcomes a challenging encounter" general event and you earn 2 honor points for the "defeat a challenging monster of the opposite alignment" chivalric event. The tables of honor point adjustments for the various types of codes provide examples of events that would cause you to gain or lose honor points. The honor point values are guidelines; the GM should adjust them as appropriate to the situation and campaign.
