Hiding a small object on your person (such as a light weapon or easily concealed ranged weapon such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) requires a Finesse check opposed by the Perception check of anyone observing or frisking you. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if you're concealing a dagger. Someone frisking you gains a +4 bonus on this Perception check. The type of item you conceal and the nature of your attire can modify your check. These modifiers are cumulative.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Circumstance</td><td>Finesse DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Dagger</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Extraordinarily small object (coin, ring, shuriken)</td><td>+4</td></tr> <tr><td>Heavy or baggy clothing</td><td>+2</td></tr> </table>

Action: Standard, or move at a -20 penalty.

Try Again: Yes, but a second attempt against the same target increases the DC by 10.

Drawing Weapons: Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
