As explained in the <a href="rules948f.html?Name=Psychic%20Duels&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Psychic Duels</a> section, a binary mindscape is created when two psychic creatures enter a mental confrontation. Only creatures able to cast the <a href="spelldisplay1d9f.html?ItemName=instigate%20psychic%20duel">instigate psychic duel</a> spell can begin a psychic duel. Once a connection is established, the binary mindscape is created. Once within the mindscape, a creature can expend psychic energy to create mental hazards called manifestations to damage the other combatant or to reshape the mental landscape. Because the mindscape becomes a shared mental space after its creation, neither participant in the battle truly controls it, and they both have an equal ability to alter the environment once their minds are connected.

A binary mindscape is overt, finite, and harmful (see <a href="rules2e34.html?Name=Mindscape%20Traits&amp;Category=Mindscapes">Mindscape Traits</a>). Its other traits (such as gravity, time, and magic) are normal, with the exception of the special actions and limitations on spellcasting described in the Psychic Duels section.
