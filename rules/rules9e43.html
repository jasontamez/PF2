This is a refuge in the wild where spellcasters tied to nature can enjoy shelter and practice their crafts in outdoor surroundings. Most Druid's Groves serve primarily as places of worship, but they can also act as military strongholds for druids operating in wildernesses with particularly dangerous fauna, or who find themselves at odds with local settlements and governments.



Redoubt

The reinforced, highly defensible structures built into the natural terrain known as Redoubts are often constructed to take advantage of locations such as cave entrances, mountain passes, or river fords. Communities may build Redoubts as defensive positions in times of war when their farms and towns can't be defended effectively. Lords trying to tame and control newly claimed lands often make the construction of a Redoubt their first order of business as a temporary measure until a keep or larger fortification can be built.



Treehouse

Treehouse strongholds are particularly popular among small communities living in wildernesses so dangerous that sleeping on the ground is never safe. Such groups craft residences sized for one or two families into the boughs of neighboring trees, with bridges connecting the individual structures.

Treehouses are also popular among scouts and ranger organizations who wish to maintain a permanent presence in the wild but do not wish to be easily found. The most well-established ranger strongholds combine thick walls with the advantage of high ground, adding six Fortification augmentations at an additional cost of 48 Goods and 42 Labor, or 1,800 gp. Even larger buildings with arboreal augmentations can be found in Kyonin and, according to rumor, the Uskwood.

Rooms 1 Alchemy Lab, 1 Altar, 1 Animal Pen, 1 Artisan's Workshop, 10 Attuned* (all), 1 Bedroom, 1 Book Repository, 1 Escape Route, 1 Greenhouse, 1 Laboratory, 1 Storage

Be it a crazy old hermit, a hag, or just an herbalist who likes to live near the source of her craft, a spellcaster who prefers to dwell far from civilization calls this structure home.
