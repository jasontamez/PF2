A character's bonus languages from the Linguistics skill work like the bonus on skill checks she gains from her level. She gains a number of bonus languages equal to 1/2 her level (minimum 1) if she has either a specialty in Linguistics or training in the Social skill group. If she has both a specialty in Linguistics and training in the Social skill group, she knows a number of bonus languages equal to her full level.
