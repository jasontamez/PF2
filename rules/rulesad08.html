Apostate: A member of your Cult leaves and badmouths you to outsiders. For 1d6 days, the organization takes a -5 penalty on checks to generate capital. If you rolled a 6 for the number of days, there's a 50% chance the end of this event causes an image problem event as described below. Silencing the apostate (through threats, violence, or bribes worth 1d6 points of Goods or Influence) ends this penalty early.

Blasphemy: Someone in your Cult has broken a serious taboo. All divine casters in the Cult treat their caster level as 1 lower than normal for 1d3 days.

Divine Flux: Treat this as an arcane flux event on the <a href="rules4635.html?Name=Cabel%20Events&amp;Category=Organization%20Events">Cabal Events</a> table (see page 127), except the bonus spell slot is divine instead of arcane.

Image Problem: An influential person, such as a conservative noble or leader of a rival church, attempts to discredit your organization. Attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check opposed by this person's Bluff or Intimidate check (1d20 + 5 if the GM doesn't have a specific person in mind). Success means you weather these attempts and the event ends with no negative repercussions. If you win by at least 5, you increase your fame, gaining your choice of 1 point of Influence or Labor. If you fail, you lose 1d3 points of Goods, Influence, and Labor (divided as you see fit) because of vandalism or members leaving out of fear.

Popular Ritual: One of your unusual customs, such as frequent use of hallucinogens or naked dancing, increases the Cult's popularity. For 1d8 days, the building gains a +5 bonus on its first check to generate Influence or Labor each day. If you rolled an 8 for the number of days, there's a 50% chance the end of this event causes an image problem event as described above.

Portent: One of your members has a vision or interprets something as a religious sign, increasing religious fervor among the other followers. Choose Goods, Influence, or Labor. For 2d6 days, the Cult gains a +5 bonus on its first check to generate that type of capital each day.

Schism: A popular member of your Cult tries to steal some of your people and create her own Cult. Attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Knowledge (religion) check against a DC equal to 20 + the number of teams in the organization. If you succeed, treat this as an apostate event as described above. If you fail by less than 5, you lose 1d2 points of Influence and 1d2 points of Labor. If you fail by 5 or more, you lose one team for every 5 full points by which you failed the DC. These lost teams go with the apostate.
