Clerics and oracles find the job of summoning and binding outsiders much easier than arcane spellcasters do. A cleric calls upon her deity to send a like-minded creature by way of one of the <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a> spells. That outsider is in the service of the god, and its desires almost always align with the cleric's goals, or at least run in parallel with them.

The cleric must bargain with the deity's servant for a payment agreed upon before the outsider will perform the task: gold, magic items, gifts, sacrifices, or promises by the cleric to achieve certain goals particular to the conjured ally. The greater the task, the greater the payment required, with a minimum of 100 gp worth of goods or services, sometimes extending into the thousands-and sometimes the ally simply refuses the cleric's binding if the job is too dangerous or beneath its dignity.
