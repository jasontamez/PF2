A lost animal companion, cohort, familiar, or follower can be raised or resurrected with spells such as <a href="spelldisplay0d07.html?ItemName=raise%20dead">raise dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayd65d.html?ItemName=resurrection">resurrection</a>, or <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a>. For a cohort or follower with character levels, these kinds of spells give the character one or more negative levels-a price worth paying if the alternative is death. Creatures with no character levels (such as animal companions and familiars) count as 1st level for the purpose of these spells, and therefore they take Constitution drain instead of negative levels. A nonsentient companion is assumed to be willing to return to life unless you were cruel to it or directly responsible for its death.

In most cases, the companion probably remembers its last moments alive and understands that you're the reason why it is alive again. For a lower-level cohort or a non-adventuring follower, the gift of a second chance at life is something very treasured and earns you great respect and devotion. You can gain the reputation of "fairness and generosity" for the purposes of the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat.

Using <a href="spelldisplay0315.html?ItemName=reincarnate">reincarnate</a> is an alternative option, but has a similar effect on a companion's loyalty and affection. Few humans would choose to be reincarnated as a bugbear or kobold, but if the choice is that or death, a new life in a new body is generally preferred. For an animal companion, the GM should create a random table of creatures similar to its original form-for example, a lion might be reincarnated as a leopard, cheetah, or tiger.
