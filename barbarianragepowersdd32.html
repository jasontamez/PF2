Barbarian Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.



Skald Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide</a>
At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32-34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the inf luence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).

<td>Bestial Climber (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 26</a>):  While raging, the barbarian gains a natural climb speed equal to her land speed. A barbarian must have the raging climber rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Bestial Flyer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  While raging, the barbarian's fly speed increases by 10 feet and her maneuverability improves by one category. A barbarian must have a fly speed before raging, have the raging flyer power, and be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Bestial Leaper (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 26</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can take a move action to move and can take her normal standard action at any point during the move.

</tr><tr></td>Boasting Taunt (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 74</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can incite a creature to attack her by making an Intimidate check to demoralize. If the check succeeds, the target is also shaken as long as the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Come and Get Me (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 74</a>):  While raging, as a free action the barbarian may leave herself open to attack while preparing devastating counterattacks. Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the barbarian until the beginning of her next turn, but every attack against the barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is resolved prior to resolving each enemy attack. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Contagious Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian howls during combat, agitating nearby fauna. Willing animals and magical beasts within 30 feet of the barbarian gain the benefits of the <a href="spelldisplay77eb.html?ItemName=rage">rage</a> spell for as long as she maintains her rage. After the barbarian's rage ends, creatures affected by her rage are fatigued for the same number of rounds as the barbarian. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Disruptive (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 74</a>):  When raging, the barbarian gains <a href="featdisplay26bb.html?ItemName=Disruptive">Disruptive</a> as a bonus feat. The barbarian must have the superstition rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Dissipating Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When the barbarian rages, her feverish frenzy and hot breath burn or blow fog, smoke and similar effects away from her. The barbarian and creatures adjacent to her do not gain concealment from obfuscating effects like fog or precipitation. Magical effects that require more than a strong wind to dissipate are not affected by this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Eclipsing Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  While the barbarian is raging, the light level within 10 feet of her lowers by one step. She can't decrease the light level below normal darkness with this ability. Multiple barbarians with this rage power don't further reduce the light level. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Eclipsing Rage, Greater (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  Whenever the barbarian rages, the light level within 20 feet of her lowers by two steps instead of one. She still can't decrease the light level below normal darkness with this ability. A barbarian must be at least 10th level and have the eclipsing rage- power to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Energy Eruption (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack and unleash it upon her enemies once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it. At any point during the remainder of her rage she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or 30-foot cone. The breath weapon inflicts damage equal to the damage from the attack absorbed by the barbarian, but creatures within the area may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier) for half damage even if the original effect did not allow a save. A barbarian must have the energy absorption rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 16th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Beast (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8w7p?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Animal-Archive">Animal Archive pg. 7</a>):  While the barbarian is raging, her animal companion also gains the benefits of rage (including greater rage, mighty rage, and tireless rage), though the barbarian must spend 1 additional round of rage per round if her companion begins or ends its turn adjacent to her, and 2 additional rounds of rage per round if not.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Beast, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8w7p?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Animal-Archive">Animal Archive pg. 7</a>):  While the barbarian is raging, her animal companion shares the benefits of the barbarian's rage powers that are constant in effect. It gains no benefit from rage powers that require actions to activate, even if they are free actions. A barbarian must have the ferocious beast rage power and be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Mount (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount also gains the benefits of rage (including greater rage and mighty rage) as long as the barbarian is mounted or adjacent to it. While her mount is raging in this way, she must spend one additional round of rage per round. She can elect not to pay this cost, in which case her mount does not rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ferocious Mount, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 75</a>):  While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the benefits of any rage powers that are constant in effect when the barbarian is raging. It does not gain the benefit of any rage powers that require actions to activate, even if they are free actions. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Flight Response (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9n5a?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Horror-Adventures">Horror Adventures pg. 46</a>): When a barbarian with this rage power attempts a saving throw against a fear effect, she can enter a rage as an immediate action (as long as she would normally be able to enter rage). This consumes 3 rounds of the barbarian's daily allotment of rage rounds, but the barbarian can maintain the rage each round on her turn normally. Any benefits from the barbarian's rage apply immediately, so she gains her bonus on Will saves against the effect that required the initial saving throw. Unlike most rage powers, this rage power's effects are useful only when the barbarian is not raging, so a skald can't grant this rage power to allies with raging song.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Fueled by Vengeance (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy91dq?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Moon">Blood of the Moon pg. 13</a>):  While raging, whenever you deal weapon damage to a creature that dealt damage to you since the end of your last turn, add 1 round to your remaining number of rounds of rage for the current day. You can gain no more than 1 extra round of rage each round. You must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Furious Draw (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): The barbarian is treated as having the <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a> feat.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Inspire Ferocity (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can use a move action to impart her reckless abandon modifier to all willing allies within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A barbarian must have the reckless abandon rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Lizard Stride (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When the barbarian makes a charge or run action while raging, she can move across the surface of water without sinking. She sinks immediately if she ends her turn standing on water.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Low-Light Vision (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian's senses sharpen and she gains low-light vision while raging.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Master of the Deep (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9pn6?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-the-First-World">Legacy of the First World pg. 29</a>): As a standard action, the barbarian commands an aquatic creature to do her bidding. The barbarian selects a creature with the aquatic type within 30 feet and gives a terse command from those listed in the <a href="spelldisplaye5f6.html?ItemName=command">command</a> spell. Alternatively, if the creature has an Intelligence of 1 or 2, the barbarian may instead command the creature to attack the closest creature to it as a standard action. The creature must succeed at a Will save (DC equal to 10 + half the barbarian's level + her Strength modifier) or obey the command to the best of its ability on its next turn. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against master of the deep (successful or not), it is immune to this power for 24 hours. This ability is a mind-affecting effect, but it is not language dependent; the creature need not understand the barbarian giving the command. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Moment of Clarity (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian does not gain any benefits or take any of the penalties from rage for 1 round. Activating this power is a swift action. This includes the penalty to Armor Class and the restriction on what actions can be performed. This round still counts against her total number of rounds of rage per day. This power can only be used once per rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Night Vision (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian's senses grow incredibly sharp while raging and she gains darkvision 60 feet. A barbarian must have low-light vision as a rage power or a racial trait to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>No Escape (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian can move up to double her normal speed as an immediate action but she can only use this ability when an adjacent foe uses a withdraw action to move away from her. She must end her movement adjacent to the enemy that used the withdraw action. The barbarian provokes attacks of opportunity as normal during this movement. This power can only be used once per rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Pack Rage (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When a barbarian with this rage power enters a rage, any barbarian within 30 feet who also has this rage power can enter a rage. A barbarian that enters a rage outside of her turn spends 1 round of rage immediately and then spends another round of rage to maintain her rage at the beginning of her next turn. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Perfect Clarity (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  While using her moment of clarity rage power, the barbarian can roll twice for any miss chance or Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions, taking the better result. A barbarian must have the moment of clarity rage power before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Primal Scent (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  When using her scent rage power, the barbarian adds half her barbarian level on Survival checks made to track by scent and on Perception checks to pinpoint the location of creatures she cannot see. If she pinpoints the location of a creature that has total concealment, she treats it as having concealment. A barbarian must have the scent rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Climber (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all Climb skill checks.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Flier (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 114</a>):  Once per rage, the character can fly up to her base speed as a move action. If she uses the charge action, she can use this flight as part of her movement during the charge. A character must be at least 6th level and have the raging leaper rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Flyer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus to Fly checks.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Leaper (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all Acrobatics skill checks made to jump. When making a jump in this way, the barbarian is always considered to have a running start.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Swimmer (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): When raging, the barbarian adds her level as an enhancement bonus on all Swim skill checks.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Whirlwind (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian can create a whirlwind with a powerful spinning move as an immediate action after she confirms a critical hit with a melee attack. The whirlwind circles the target of her melee attack, lifting it in the air slightly until the end of the barbarian's turn. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier) to negate this effect. If it fails the save, the target loses its Dexterity modifier to AC for the rest of the barbarian's turn and lands prone on the ground at the end of her turn. Raging whirlwind has no effect on flying creatures. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to choose this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Roaring Drunk (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 morale bonus on Intimidate checks and to the save DC of any fear effects she creates for each alcoholic drink she has consumed during her rage, to a maximum of +1 per four barbarian levels.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Roused Anger (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian may enter a rage even if fatigued. While raging after using this ability, the barbarian is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this rage ends, the barbarian is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent raging.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Savage Intuition (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy91dq?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Moon">Blood of the Moon pg. 13</a>):  Your bestial senses allow you to sense danger and become enraged before you even have time to consciously react to danger. When combat begins, if you have rounds of rage remaining, you may automatically enter a rage without using an action at the start of the first round of combat (or at the start of the surprise round, if there is one), even if you are not otherwise aware that combat has begun.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Scent (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian gains the scent ability while raging and can use this ability to locate unseen foes (see Special Abilities for rules on the scent ability).</td>
</tr><tr></td>Spellbreaker (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  When raging, the barbarian gains <a href="featdisplay7d96.html?ItemName=Spellbreaker">Spellbreaker</a> as a bonus feat. A barbarian must have the disruptive rage power and be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Spirit Steed (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 77</a>):  While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains DR/magic equal to 1/2 the barbarian's level. The mount's natural weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Sprint (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  Once per rage, the barbarian can use a single full-round run action to move up to 6 times her speed or a single full-round charge action to move up to 3 times her speed. A barbarian must have the swift foot rage power and be at least 4th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Suffocating Grip (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9pn6?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-the-First-World">Legacy of the First World pg. 29</a>): While raging, when the barbarian successfully maintains a grapple, she can choke her opponent instead of dealing damage to, moving, pinning, or tying up her opponent. The grappled opponent cannot speak or breathe and must hold its breath or begin suffocating. The grappled opponent can take a breath during any round in which the barbarian does not maintain the grapple. Creatures that do not breathe are not affected by this ability.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Suffocating Grip, Greater (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9pn6?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-the-First-World">Legacy of the First World pg. 29</a>): When the barbarian is using the suffocating grip rage power, the grappled creature cannot hold its breath and immediately begins suffocating. A barbarian must be at least 12th level and have the suffocating grip rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Swift Foot (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 34</a>): The barbarian gains a 5-foot enhancement bonus to her speed. This increase is always active while the barbarian is raging. A barbarian can select this rage power up to three times. Its effects stack.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Ultimate Clarity (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 114</a>):  Once per rage, the character can ref ine her senses, seeing through normal and magical darkness (including from magical effects such as blur and displacement), invisibility, and illusions; she can also discern the exact locations of creatures with concealment. This lasts for 1 round. A character must be at least 6th level and have the moment of clarity and perfect clarity rage powers to select this rage power. The character does not need to be using moment of clarity to use this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Water Sense (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978r?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-River">People of the River pg. 7</a>):  The barbarian's senses are no longer fooled by the rippling surface and confounding reflections seen in water that is being used as cover by her foes. While the barbarian is raging and on land, opponents in the water gain only partial cover from her attacks, instead of improved cover. In addition, while on land and targeting an opponent in water, she takes only a -1 penalty on attacks with ranged weapons (including thrown weapons) for every 5 feet of water they pass through (instead of the usual -2 penalty for every 5 feet of water).</td>
