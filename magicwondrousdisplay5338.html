Description

Excavated within the Shackles among the temples of its lost Ghol-Gan culture, these stone disks display whorls of symbols in the dead language of that dead kingdom, centered about a sphere of black volcanic glass. Each disk acts as a word of recall spell when the command word is spoken; each disk is keyed to a specific island in the territory once controlled by the people of Ghol-Gan. The disk functions once per day, and its destination cannot be changed.

Most of these are in the hands of Shackles pirate lords.
