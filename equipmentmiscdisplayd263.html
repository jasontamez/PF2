Description

This set of flashy-perhaps even gaudy- clothes is meant for entertaining. Entertainer's outfits come in a wide range of styles, from scandalous to flattering to absurd. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design does nothing to inhibit your ability to tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or run (if the audience turns ugly).
