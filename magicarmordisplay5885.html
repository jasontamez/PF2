Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of ghost spike armor can command armor spikes made of shimmering force to erupt from the armor for up to 10 rounds. Treat these spikes as +1 ghost touch armor spikes with which the wearer is proficient. While the spikes are active, the wearer can attempt to grapple incorporeal creatures with a -4 penalty on his combat maneuver checks to grapple. The wearer can dismiss the spikes as a free action. The ghost spike ability cannot be placed on spiked armor or on a shield.
