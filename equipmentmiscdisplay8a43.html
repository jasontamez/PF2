Description

When worn inside voluminous sleeves, this leather holster allows you to draw a concealed hand crossbow or coat pistol as a move action. The weapon sits on sliders and is drawn directly into the hand. Unlike a wrist sheath, a sleeve holster is bulky enough that it is obvious on close inspection, though under a loose enough garment it might not provoke a reactive Perception check. An individual sleeve holster fits for either a hand crossbow or a coat pistol, but not both.
