Description

This colorful, beaded mask bears floral patterns and attunes the wearer's senses to flora of all varieties. The wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks relating to plants, seasons, or weather. The wearer can use a command word to gain the effects of <a href="spelldisplay4a56.html?ItemName=greensight">greensight</a>, except that the wearer can freely focus her vision to see through plant matter for any distance up to 60 feet (for example, to examine the inner core of a reed) during the effect's duration. The greensight ability can be used a total of 10 times; when these uses are expended, the mask loses its magic and becomes a normal beaded mask. Most Tlil masks are discovered with 1d10 uses of greensight remaining; reduce the price by 300 gp for each expended use.
