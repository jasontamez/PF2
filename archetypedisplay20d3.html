Alley Witch

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ghc?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-of-the-Streets">Heroes of the Streets pg. 20</a>
Some witches find their spark of magic in the long, dark shadows and forgotten places within the city.

Child of the Streets:  An alley witch gains Bluff and Knowledge (local) as class skills, but loses Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (planes) as class skills. This alters the witch's class skills.

Crowd Patron:  An alley witch draws power not from a patron, but from the crowd of minds around her. She doesn't select a patron at 1st level; instead, she gains the following bonus spells at the listed levels.

2nd-ears of the city (see page 30), 4th-alter self, 6th-witness, 8th-shadow step, 10th-mage's private sanctum, 12th-heroes' feast, 14th-limited wish, 16th-create demiplane, 18th-shades.

This ability alters witch's familiar.

Speak to the City:  An alley witch builds a special rapport with a single city. At 1st level, she can select one settlement whose type is large town size or larger. Within this settlement, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks, as well as Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Sense Motive checks. At 6th level and every 5 witch levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 2. The alley witch can build a rapport with a new city after 30 days of remaining there; this severs her bond to her previous settlement. This ability replaces the witch's 1st-level hex.

Hex Trader:  At 6th level, once per day as a full-round action, an alley witch can bind a hex she knows into a feather, bead, or other small token. Any creature holding this token can use that hex once as if using a potion, targeting itself or a creature it touches. While a hex is sealed into a token, the alley witch loses her ability to use that hex until the token is used or she can recover the token. If a hex can be used in increments (like the disguise hex), the alley witch decides how many increments the token contains when making it. If a hex has no set duration, it lasts for 1 minute once activated. This ability replaces the witch's 6th-level hex.
