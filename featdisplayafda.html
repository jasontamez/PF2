Your harmonies reinforce and empower your allies' magic.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaycdea.html?ItemName=Basic%20Harmony">Basic Harmony</a>, Perform (keyboard, percussion, sing, string, or wind) 10 ranks, bardic performance or raging song.

Benefit:  As a standard action, you may expend one round of bardic performance to boost the effectiveness of the bardic performance of an ally within 60 feet who also has this feat. Until the beginning of your next turn, if that ally uses a bardic performance that allows a saving throw, increase that saving throw DC by 2.
