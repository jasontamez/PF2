Description

This buckler-sized mirror magnifies flaws and faults, presenting
the least appealing image of any creature reflected in it. The
mirror must be held in one hand to function. As a standard
action three times per day, the bearer of the mirror can project
a reflection onto the creature that produced it, making them
appear utterly loathsome to all onlookers. The subject must be
within 30 feet of the mirror, and must be able to see the mirror
to be affected. For the next 5 rounds any creature attempting to
target the subject with a beneficial spell or effect must make a
DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature must choose a new
subject for the spell or effect is wasted. Once a creature succeeds
on this saving throw, it can target the subject normally for the
remainder of the mirror's effect's duration.
