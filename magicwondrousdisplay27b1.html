Description

Once per day this simple woolen robe allows you to assume the
form of another humanoid creature, as if using alter self. This
change lasts for 1 hour, although you can end it prematurely
as a free action. While in this form, you also gain the ability to
speak and understand the basic racial languages of your chosen
form. For example, if you take the form of an orc, you can speak
and understand Orc.
