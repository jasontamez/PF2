Description

This water-polished stone is carved in the shape of a frog-like head and decorated with evil runes. It feels lighter than it should, as if hollow and partially filled with liquid. When a hydrodaemon runestone is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a hydrodaemon appears as if summoned by a summon monster VI spell. Normally, the daemon is under the control of the creature that broke the runestone, but there is a 25% chance that the daemon is uncontrolled and attacks its summoner.
