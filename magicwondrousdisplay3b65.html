Description

A creature coated with this glittering
golden dust can interact with any one
item or object as if she had successfully
used the Use Magic Device skill to
emulate a class feature or race (if the
exact result of the check matters, treat
the character's result as a 25). If the user
of the dust does not mentally select the
intended item or object while coating herself with the dust,
the magic of the dust applies to the first eligible object she
encounters. She can apply the result of this automatic check
when dealing with the item or object for 1 hour after exposure
to the dust.
