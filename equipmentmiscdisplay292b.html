Description

The effects of this gray-green pill last for 5 minutes after consumption. During this time, when making a full attack, you can accept alchemical burn to make your second attack at your full base attack bonus instead of the attack bonus for your second attack. An accuracy lozenge gives no benefit on attacks beyond the second, nor does it provide a second attack if you don't already have one.

Construction
