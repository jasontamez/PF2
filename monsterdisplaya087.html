Special Abilities

Genie-Touched Abilities Each of the four breeds of genie-touched horse (istaheq, misayyah, tuanu, and zefaheen) has three unique genie-touched abilities. In addition, each breed has energy resistance to a specific form of energy and can understand (but cannot speak) one elemental language.

Description

Legends hold that in the distant past, genies gifted certain Keleshite tribes with the companionship of a powerful race of equine mounts. Exactly what these mysterious creatures originally were is now lost to time, but their descendants exist still in the form of four distinct breeds of supernatural steeds known as genietouched horses.

Istaheq

The stoic istaheq is the favored mount of the Al-Zabriti horse-breeding tribes. Istaheqs are dark gray or black.

Istaheq

Resist acid 10 Languages Kelish, Terran (cannot speak any language)

Special Abilities

Scion of Stone (Ex) Istaheqs are immune to petrification. An istaheq does not treat rubble or other uneven stone or rocky footing as difficult terrain, and it is immune to the effects of spike stones and caltrops. Finally, an istaheq's natural armor bonus is +10, rather than the typical +8 for most genie-touched horses.

Steadfast (Ex) An istaheq gains a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting and fear effects. While serving willingly as a mount, an istaheq is immune to fear effects.

Thundering Hooves (Su) Once per day as a standard action, an istaheq can rear up and slam its hooves down hard against the ground. For 1 round, the ground in a 30-foot radius around the istaheq shakes, allowing the istaheq to attempt a single trip combat maneuver check against all creatures standing in this area. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Misayyah

Temperamental, fierce, and courageous, a misayyah usually tolerates only one rider, with whom it forms a close bond-it often grows despondent if separated from its chosen partner. Misayyahs' coats are a shimmering metallic gold or bay, and they have intense amber eyes.

Misayyah

Resist Fire 10 Languages Ignan, Kelish (cannot speak any language)

Special Abilities

Firesight (Ex) A misayyah can see through fire and smoke without penalties. It is immune to the dazzled condition, and it gains a +4 saving throw on Fortitude saves against blindness caused by bright light.

Flaming Trail (Su) Once per day when a misayyah charges, it can leave behind a trail of fire up to 20 feet in length along its path. This functions as per wall of fire (CL 7th) and lasts for 1 round. If the misayyah makes a single hoof attack after using flaming trail, it deals an additional 2d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. A creature that takes this fire damage must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or catch on fire. The save DC is Constitution-based

Sunborn (Ex) A misayyah gives off more body heat than a normal horse, and while a misayyah can exist comfortably in hot environments, its rider takes a -2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws to resist detrimental effects from hot environments while riding one. In cold environments, a misayyah's rider is protected from the temperature as if via endure elements. During the day, while outside and above ground, a misayyah gains a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks.

Tuanu

Tuanus are known for their fluid gait and intuitive responses. They are dark dappled gray with blue eyes.

Tuanu

Resist Cold 10 Languages Aquan, Kelish (cannot speak any language)

Special Abilities

Fluid Movement (Ex) A tuanu gains a +2 bonus to its CMD. A tuanu's rider gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Ride checks to stay in the saddle and on concentration checks attempted as a result of the motion while riding the tuanu. However, the bonus does not apply to concentration checks triggered by other causes, such as being injured while casting or when casting defensively.

Water Sense (Ex) A tuanu can use Survival to dowse for water (see the dowsing skill unlock on page 195 of Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures). A tuanu does not require a dowsing rod to use this ability, and it gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks (for a total bonus of +9) to dowse for water.

Waterborn (Su) A tuanu has the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality. It has a swim speed of 30 feet. For up to 1 hour per day, the tuanu can grant a rider the ability to breathe underwater as long as the latter remains mounted.

Zefaheen

Intelligent, strong willed, and fast as the wind, zefaheens are silvery gray in color and have startling gray eyes.

Zefaheen

Resist Electricity 10 Languages Auran, Kelish (cannot speak any language)

Special Abilities

Air Walker (Sp) Once per day, a zefaheen can use air walk as a spell-like ability (CL 7th).

Desert Walker (Ex) A zefaheen suffers no harm from hot environments, and it never treats natural desert terrain as difficult terrain. It gains a +4 bonus on all Survival checks made while in a desert. A zefaheen does not leave tracks in a desert, as if under the effects of pass without trace.

Sand Sense (Ex) A zefaheen gains a +5 racial bonus on Perception checks in sandy desert environments, as well as a +2 racial bonus on Will saves against illusions (including mirages). The zefaheen can see through mist or sandstorm winds
