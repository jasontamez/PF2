Description

This ornately etched censer has a small hidden compartment under the heat source that can hold 1 dose of poison. When in use, the censer's heat source indirectly heats the poison, causing it to mix with the burning incense and allow the poison to permeate the air, filling a 20-foot radius centered on the censer. The poison's type changes to inhaled, and it is effective for 5 minutes before it is entirely burned off.
