For reasons known only to them, witch-watchers offer protection to nobles across Golarion. While they serve openly in Irrisen and Varisia, they watch from the shadows in courts in Brevoy, Mendev, the River Kingdoms, and Ustalav, where their presence is barely tolerated.

Diminished Spellcasting: A witch-watcher gains one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to zero, she can cast spells of that level only if her Intelligence score is high enough to grant bonus spells of that level.

This alters the witch's spellcasting.

Covenant Ally (Su): Once per day when preparing her spells, a witch-watcher makes a covenant with her patron to provide protection to a single creature, known as her covenant ally. As a standard action when her covenant ally is within 30 feet, a witch-watcher can grant it one of the abilities listed below. Unless otherwise noted, each ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the witch-watcher's Intelligence modifier. She can grant a number of abilities per day equal to 1/2 her witch level (minimum 1).

Health: The covenant ally gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the witch-watcher's witch level  her Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.

Safeguard: The covenant ally gains a deflection bonus to AC or a resistance bonus on saving throws equal to 1/2 the witch-watcher's witch level (minimum 1). When given, this bonus can be divided between the AC and saving throws as the witch-watcher wishes, up to a maximum of  for either.

Solace: The witch-watcher temporarily disrupts a spell affecting her covenant ally by succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as per dispel magic. The ability suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the witchwatcher's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability suppresses the spell effect only for the covenant ally. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.

Spell Resistance: The covenant ally gains spell resistance equal to 6  the witch-watcher's witch level for a number of rounds equal to the witch-watcher's Intelligence modifier. At 10th level, the spell resistance increases to 11  the witch-watcher's witch level. The spell resistance cannot be suppressed, but it doesn't affect spells cast by the witch-watcher.
