Description

On command, the wearer of a suit of radiant flight armor can conjure a pair of batlike wings from her back that shed light like a torch. These wings grant a fly speed of 30 (poor maneuverability) for 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-minute increments. The radiant flight special ability can be applied only to heavy armor.
