Description

This plume is oversized, chic, and extravagant. To gain its effects, the user must affix it to a nonmagical hat worth at least 10 gp. Once per day when the wearer performs a deed, the plume provides her with 1 panache point that can be used for that deed. Once used, the plume appears wilted and bedraggled until its magic is replenished.
