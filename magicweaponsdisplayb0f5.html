Description

This +1 paper alchemical cartridge is contains a bullet and is marked with an open eye. When fired from a firearm, a scouting cartridge allows the wielder to temporarily transfer his sense of sight to the location where the bullet lands. Until he dismisses the effect by rubbing his eyes as a move action, the wielder can see as clairvoyance from the square in which the bullet landed, regardless of whether it hit its mark.
