Description

This specialized suit of full plate is made from the tanned hide of a linnorm and acts as +4 dragonhide plate. If a creature is slain while wearing such armor, its killer is subject to a curse. The cursed creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or gain vulnerability to fire until the curse is removed. This curse can be removed only by a break enchantment, miracle, or wish spell. This particular suit of armor is made from the hide of a crag linnorm, though others exist, each with a different curse effect similar to the curse of the associated linnorm.

Once per day as a swift action, the wear of this armor can summon forth the uncanny movement powers of a linnorm, gaining the benefits of freedom of movement for 10 minutes.
