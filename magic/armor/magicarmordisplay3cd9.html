Description

This metal +1 klar is shaped like the head of a storm roc, whose sharp feathers serve as the klar's spikes, and it hums and crackles like a distant stormy sky. When used to make a shield bash attack, a Storval's fang deals an additional 1d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, the wielder gains electricity resistance 5. When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a Storval's fang, it unleashes a thunderclap, deafening the target of the critical hit for 1 minute unless that target succeeds at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw.

If the wielder of a Storval's fang also wields a Storval's thunder and uses the Thunder and Fang feat, each weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage, the DCs to negate their critical hit effects increase by 2, and a creature that fails such a saving throw is also pushed back 10 feet and knocked prone.
