Description

This suit of +2 full plate has been etched and stained in such a way that it resembles the form and shape of a decomposed body that is encased in a suit of armor. The wearer is effectively hidden from non-intelligent undead, which can't see, hear, or smell him; even extraordinary or supernatural senses capabilities can't penetrate the magical shroud. An intelligent undead creature can attempt a single Will saving throw (DC 14) to penetrate the ward. All affected undead behave as if the wearer simply isn't there.
