Description

This +1 hide armor is stitched together from grizzly bear hides. When the wearer rages, she automatically turns into a Large brown bear, as if using change shape (beast shape II). The armor melds with her new form as normal, but the armor's enhancement bonus changes into a +1 enhancement bonus to her natural armor. When the rage ends, the wearer reverts to her own form.
