Description

The Sargavan government often issues this armor to scouts traveling through the jungle. This +1 expeditious glamered leather armor is colored a deep brown and painted with jungle camouflage. Scouts transform the armor to match the armor style and symbology of communities they visit, and use the expeditious special ability if they find they're unwelcome. In its true form, the armor grants a +3 competence bonus on Stealth checks. When transformed to fit a culture's style of dress, it instead grants a +3 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks against people of that culture.
