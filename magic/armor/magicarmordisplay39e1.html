Description

A shield with this special ability is usually crafted with an open dragon's mouth on the front. A shield with the wyrmsbreath special ability is keyed to one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The shield gains 1 charge for every 5 points of damage from the keyed energy type the wearer takes. On command, the bearer can expend 1 to 5 charges from the shield to have it create a breath weapon in a 15 foot cone dealing 1d4 points of energy damage per charge expended (Reflex DC 11 half). This damage is the same type as the shield's keyed energy type. A shield can store up to 5 charges at a time, and stored charges expire harmlessly after 24 hours. A shield cannot have more than one wyrmsbreath ability.
