Description

Armor with this special ability often has revolting fleshy protrusions that periodically quiver and twitch. Once per day on command, the armor fuses with the flesh of the wearer for 30 minutes or until dismissed. The armor doesn't grant any armor bonus to AC during this time, though the wearer still gains any of the armor's magic abilities. While fused with the armor, the wearer can manifest two of the following evolutions from the summoner list of eidolon evolutions (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 60): gills, improved natural armor, resistance, scent, slam, and swim. The wearer can't wear another suit of armor while fused with evolving armor.
