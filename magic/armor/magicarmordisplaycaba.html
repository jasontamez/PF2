Description

This suit of +4 bolstering grinding adamantine full plate bristles with long thorns and barbs along the edges of its heavy plates. These are gained from the grinding special ability, and also act as +1 cruel armor spikes. As a swift action whenever Ebon Thorn's spikes damage an opponent, its wearer can attempt a Intimidate check to demoralize that opponent. The wearer doesn't take the normal -4 penalty on Intimidate checks made against larger opponents.
