Description

This battered, well-used suit of +1 half-plate automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wearer. Once per day on command, the armor can bestow upon its wearer the effects of righteous might for 5 rounds. The wearer's alignment determines the DR gained from this ability. A good wearer gains DR 5/evil, an evil wearer gains DR 5/good, and a wearer who is neither good nor evil chooses which DR to gain the first time she activates this ability-once chosen, it cannot be changed.
