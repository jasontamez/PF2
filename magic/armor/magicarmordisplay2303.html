Description

This flat, gray +1 breastplate is embossed with the iron fin symbol of the Wave Riders (Absalom's sea cavalry), and is enchanted to make it lighter in water. The armor imposes no armor check penalty on Swim checks, but still contributes to the wearer's encumbrance and applies all other armor check penalties as normal. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word even if submerged to cause the armor-and the wearer if the armor is worn-to float as per the buoyancy spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 177).
