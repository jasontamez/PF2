Description

Armor with this special ability is often engraved or enameled with religious symbols. Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect, as per the spell righteous might, lasting for 10 rounds. Righteous armor is always aligned toward good (positive energy), for the effects of righteous might. Righteous armor bestows one permanent negative level on any evil creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the armor is worn.
