Description

A character with the weapon training class feature who wields a mastering shield applies his highest weapon training bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for shield bashes made with the shield. If the character already has weapon training with the close weapon group as his highest weapon mastery, he instead applies any of the following feats he has for other weapons to attacks performed with the shield: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Weapon Focus, and Weapon Specialization. A character with the weapon mastery class feature applies weapon mastery to attacks with a mastering shield. A character without weapon training gains no benefit.
