Description

Three flensed skulls jut from the face of this +2 heavy steel shield. Three times per day as a free action, the shield's wearer can command the heads to attack independently of her, biting with the wearer's base attack bonus (making multiple attacks if the wearer has a high enough base attack bonus). This attack is in addition to any actions performed by the wearer, and deals 1d6 points of damage plus 1 point of Constitution damage.

When using the bloodfeast shield's ability, if the wearer is a vampire (or regains hit points from blood drain in a similar manner), she also heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
