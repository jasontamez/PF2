Description

Spelunker's mail allows a creature to more easily navigate narrow underground tunnels by granting the wearer the option of reducing his size when a passageway grows too narrow.

Spelunker's mail is a +1 slick chain shirt and has a dark, lustrous sheen to its blue-black links. Ten times per day, by speaking a command word, you can activate the armor's power to reduce your size. Your size category decreases by one step and you gain the relevant bonuses and penalties of your new size. Your abilities and speed remain unchanged, and all equipment you wear or carry reduces appropriately in size. This transformation lasts for up to a minute, and you can dismiss its effects as a free action.
