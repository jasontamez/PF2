Description

The weeping special quality can be applied only to a shield. As a move action, a wielder can cause a weeping shield to emit continual sobbing and wailing. While this effect is active, each good-aligned creature within 10 feet of the wielder takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. Nongood creatures and those immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this effect. The wailing lasts for 10 minutes or until ended as a move action.
