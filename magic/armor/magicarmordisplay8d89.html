Description

These +2 heavy steel shields were often issued to Gray Maiden unit leaders, and many still carry them today. Once per day as a swift action, the wielder of a maiden's aegis can reduce the enhancement bonus of the shield to +1 to grant a +1 enhancement bonus to up to four other shields within a 30-foot radius. This effect persists for 10 minutes, but it ends for any individual shield that moves more than 30 feet from the maiden's aegis that granted the bonus.
