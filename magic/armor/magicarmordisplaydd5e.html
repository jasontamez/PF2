Description

A set of sensing armor compensates when its wearer has been blinded, is in total darkness (as long as the wearer doesn't have darkvision or the see in darkness ability), or is in magical darkness (as long as the wearer doesn't have the see in darkness ability). When one of these conditions affects the wearer, sensing armor immediately grants its wearer blindsight with a 5-foot range and blindsense with a 60-foot range. As soon as the wearer can see, the additional senses end. The wearer can't gain these abilities by closing her eyes.
