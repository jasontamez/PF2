Description

The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

Normally found sized for Small humanoids, this battered and rusted suit of +1 fire resistance full plate resists any attempts to polish out its blemishes. When a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer with a manufactured weapon, natural weapon, or unarmed strike, there is a 50% chance that the armor negates the critical hit. Such a blow knocks the armor out of alignment, giving it the broken condition until the wearer spends 1d4+1 minutes refitting the pieces (or 1 minute if another person assists in the process). This does not otherwise harm the armor. While out of alignment, the goblin plate cannot negate critical hits. Broken armor provides only half the usual AC bonus (rounded down), and any armor check penalty is doubled.
