Description

A set of dragon herald vestments is covered in scales of one of
five different colors, and grants resist energy 5 of one type (as
the resist energy spell) to the wearer: acid for black or green,
electricity for blue, fire for red, or cold for white. If the wearer is
a kobold with scales matching one of those five colors, she can
speak a command word in Draconic to change the vestments-
scales to the same color as her own, or back to the color chosen
when the vestments were constructed. Altering the scales' color
is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
