Description

This suit of +1 stoneplate bears a horned gorgon's head on each shoulder and the screaming face of a medusa on its breastplate. The first suits of stone-eater armor found in the Inner Sea region were brought by explorers from faraway Casmaron, along with wild tales of a lost city destroyed by a powerful medusa.

Whenever the wearer of stone-eater armor is subject to a petrifying effect, such as that caused by a flesh to stone spell, the effect is negated and the stone-eater armor's enhancement bonus increases by 1 for 1 minute as the armor grows thicker and bulkier, covering more of the wearer's body without hindering her movement.
