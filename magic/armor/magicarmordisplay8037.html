Description

Originating in ancient Minkai, the typical jade burial suit consists of several hundred jade plaques joined with gold wire, carefully inscribed with prayers to <a href="deitydisplaya207.html?ItemName=Tsukiyo">Tsukiyo</a>, the Tian-Min god of the moon, spirits, and preservation. Jade is believed to have preservative properties, and many ancient Tian royals were buried in jade suits.

By disassembling and inverting the plaques and replacing Tsukiyo's name with that of his brother <a href="deitydisplaybc41.html?ItemName=Fumeiyoshi">Fumeiyoshi</a>, god of graves, one clever ru-shi learned how to give the impression of death instead of life. A character wearing a suit of inverted jade gains a +3 profane bonus on saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, sleep, and stunning. The wearer has the aura of an undead for the purposes of divination spells and effects, and unintelligent undead perceive the wearer as a fellow undead. The wearer, however, becomes vulnerable to effects that target or deal additional damage to undead (such as <a href="spelldisplaya67c.html?ItemName=searing%20light">searing light</a>). A suit of inverted jade otherwise functions as +3 stone lamellar.
