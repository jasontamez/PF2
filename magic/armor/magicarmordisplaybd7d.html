Description

This breastplate made from the shell of a flail snail functions as a +1 reflecting breastplate (even though that shield property cannot normally be added to armor). Once per day, the wearer can cause a spell targeted at him to reflect back at the caster, exactly like spell turning. At the GM's discretion, the wearer can instead expend this one use per day to roll on the flail snail's chart, randomly warping the spell in question.

Construction

Requirements Craft Magic Arms and Armor, spell turning, one flail snail shell; Price 18,000 gp
