Description

When the wearer of a suit of rampaging armor charges or attempts a bull rush combat maneuver check, he can ignore difficult terrain. Once per day as a swift action, when the wearer of a suit of rampaging armor charges or performs a bull rush combat maneuver, he can turn each square he moves through into difficult terrain as he demolishes everything in his path. This change of terrain remains for 1 minute. The rampaging special ability can be applied only to heavy armor.
