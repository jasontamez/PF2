Description

Armor with this special ability grants the wearer a burrow speed of 10 feet. This speed allows the wearer to tunnel through any type of soil, including rocky soil, but not actual solid stone. This special ability does not give the wearer the ability to breathe underground, so he must hold his breath or use other magic that provides air or allows him to breathe. The wearer gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against landslides, avalanches, tunnel collapses, and similar effects.
