Description

This +1 putrid padded armor is made up of colorful silks, complete with a ruffled collar that is accented with a brass button. Whenever a creature that is adjacent to the wearer confirms a critical hit against her, slimy bilgewater gushes from inside the coat onto the ground, landing in the attacking creature's space. Each creature touching the ground in this space when this effect activates must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or fall prone. For the next 5 minutes, the bilgewater replicates the effects of grease in that square, and any creatures that move through it, including the wearer of the coat, must attempt Acrobatics checks as the grease spell requires.
