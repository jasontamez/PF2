Description

This imposing suit of armor, first forged by Jistkan elemental binders, is covered in large, jagged stones and functions as +2 full plate. Once per day as an immediate action, when a bludgeoning or slashing attack strikes the wearer, the wearer can will a chunk of the stone to break off, summoning a Medium earth elemental as summon monster IV. The elemental fights as the wearer directs (and understands the wearer, even if the two do not share a language) for 7 rounds, or until it is destroyed.
