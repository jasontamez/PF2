Description

This brilliant golden +2 fire resistant full plate is decorated
with an ornate feather motif curling across its surface and
seems to radiate warmth. Once per day, the wearer can
invoke the name of the phoenix that blessed the armor and
bring the might of that phoenix against the wearer's foe.
Activating the armor causes it to ignite, wreathing the wearer
in red-gold flames as if under the effects of fire shield. In
addition, great golden wings unfold out of the back of the
armor, allowing the wearer to fly as per the spell. Both of
these effects last for 9 rounds.
