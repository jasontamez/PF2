Description

This suit of +2 field plate is composed of durable plates of steel layered over an intricate framework of gears, springs, and pistons that move with mechanical precision. A suit of clockwork armor requires a special winding key to function; this key is created as part of making a suit of clockwork armor.

In order to function, a suit of clockwork armor must be fully wound as a full-round action. Once fully wound, a suit of clockwork armor functions for 4 hours. If a suit of clockwork armor is not fully wound, its gears grind to a halt and it imposes double its normal armor check penalty and a -2 penalty to its wearer's Strength and Dexterity scores. Donning or removing a suit of unwound clockwork armor requires 10 minutes.

When fully wound, a suit of clockwork armor can be donned or removed as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. It grants the wearer a +4 temporary enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, and its weight does not count against the wearer's total encumbrance. A single crossbow or firearm sized appropriately for the wearer can be added to the armor with a successful DC 20 Craft (armorer) check. Such a weapon can be fired once as a standard action by the wearer, then automatically reloads itself in 2d4 rounds, as long as the wearer has the appropriate ammunition in his gear.
