Description

Considered the greatest archers among the Shoanti people, the folk of the Lyrune-Quah tribe treasure this +2 klar shaped from the skull of a lion. The specific shape of the skull allows the wielder to properly hold and shoot a shortbow (though not a longbow) while still benefiting from the Lyrune-Quah klar's shield bonus.

Up to three times per day as a free action, the wielder of a Lyrune-Quah klar can utter praise to the nature totem of the moon. The next arrow fired after the prayer trails a line of shimmering stars in its wake. If a creature is struck by this arrow, the stars orbit it for the next 8 rounds, negating any concealment for the target and causing it to emit light as if it were holding a sunrod.
