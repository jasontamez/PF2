Description

This +2 buckler is emblazoned with a swirl of stars and comets. Many of the Saoc Brethren commissioned these bucklers as markers of high social standing; they had them each decorated with unique depictions of constellations, comets, phases of the moon, or other distinctive astronomical sights, and used them as much as decor as for defense.

As a swift action, the user of a starsling buckler can cause the face to illuminate and whirl to life, duplicating the effect of the <a href="spelldisplay9f2d.html?ItemName=light">light</a> spell. The stars, comets, and sun begin to glow as they lift off the shield and spin around in a brilliant display. They can be fired from the spinning celestial vortex as if via a +2 sling (the user is considered proficient with the sling for purposes of resolving such attacks from a starsling buckler). All feats and proficiencies related to slings apply to stars fired from a starsling buckler. These sling attacks cannot be made as offhand weapon attacks. The shield contains five sling stars' once all five have been fired, new sling stars are restored to the shield automatically after 1 minute.
