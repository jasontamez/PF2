Description

Venom-eating armor allows its wearer to store poisons from venomous creatures for later use. Whenever the wearer of venom-eating armor is subjected to a poison attack and succeeds at a saving throw to resist the initial exposure, the venom-eating armor absorbs 1 dose of the poison. At any time after absorbing a dose of poison, the wearer of venom-eating armor can envenom a held weapon with the stored poison as a standard action without risk of poisoning himself. Venom-eating armor can hold a maximum number of poison doses equal to the total enhancement bonus of the venom-eating armor, but all doses must be the same type of poison. If the wearer of a suit of venom-eating armor succeeds at a saving throw against a new type of poison, that poison is stored in the armor and all doses of the old poison are lost. The venom-eating special ability can be applied only to armor made primarily from leather, such as leather, studded leather, and armor made of dragonhide.
