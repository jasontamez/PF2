Description

This large iron shield acts as a +1 animated light fortification heavy steel shield. The shield's bearer is immune to poison, although poisons in effect before the shield is wielded still run their course. While Savith's Iron is wielded, poisoned attacks instead bolster the bearer: if the bearer is subjected by a foe to a poison that deals ability score damage, the bearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the ability score the poison would normally damage. This bonus lasts for 1 minute; each additional dose of the same poison extends the effect for 1 additional minute. The bearer can benefit from only one bonus at a time, but can choose to benefit from a new poison in place of an old one. For example, when the bearer of Savith's Iron is stung by a wyvern, she gains a +4 enhancement bonus to her Constitution score for 1 minute; if she then comes in contact with terinav root, she must to decide whether to maintain her Constitution bonus or swap it out for a +4 enhancement bonus to her Dexterity. Savith's Iron does not grant the wielder bonuses from poisons she takes willingly or those applied by an ally, and poisons that don't inflict ability score damage have no effect.
