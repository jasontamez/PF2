Description

The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

Thanks to the unusually light and fine links of this halfling-made +2 chain shirt, it imposes no armor check penalty and the wearer's maximum Dexterity bonus is +5. After a melee attack hits the wearer, he can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action, even if he already took a 5-foot step during his turn. Taking such a step does not interfere with the wearer's movement during his next turn. A suit of mail of sly steps is usually sized for Small creatures.
