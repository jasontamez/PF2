Description

A shield of covered retreat is a wide wooden kite shield emblazoned with the image of a mighty tree, the original design of which is thought to come from Nirmathas. Three times per day as a swift action, the bearer of this +1 arrow deflection heavy wooden shield can select a single square within 5 feet (including the square occupied by the bearer) and extend a barrier of protective force around the square that lasts for 1d4 rounds. The barrier appears as a shimmer in the air, but it does not impede vision, movement, or other actions. As long as this barrier is in place, the creature occupying the square can stand up from prone or leave the square without provoking attacks of opportunity, even if the square is threatened by another creature. Other actions provoke attacks of opportunity as normal. Large or larger creatures cannot benefit from this effect. A creature occupying the square is not hindered by the barrier and may make attacks of opportunity normally.
