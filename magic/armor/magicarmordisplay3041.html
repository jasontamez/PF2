Description

A suit of armor or a shield with this ability can absorb and neutralize magical effects, albeit on a limited basis. Once per day as an immediate action, the bearer can command the armor or shield to absorb a spell, spell-like ability, or magical ability created by a magic item that specifically targets only her. It cannot absorb spells, spell-like abilities, or item effects that target an area or multiple targets. The attacker creating the magical effect to be absorbed must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or the shield or armor absorbs and neutralizes the effect.
