Description

Jagged designs of lightning, fangs, or weaponry adorn any bloodthirsty armor, which bolsters its wearer's confidence and presence with each wound the wearer inflicts. Only light or medium armor can be enchanted with the bloodthirsty special ability. Such a set of armor promotes wanton bloodshed, as its enhancement bonus to AC increases by 1 for 1 round after its wearer deals damage with a natural attack or melee weapon. If the wearer of a suit of bloodthirsty armor is raging, the armor's enhancement bonus increases by 3 instead.
