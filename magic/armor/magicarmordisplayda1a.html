Description

This formfitting black +1 leather features eight ridged support ribs along the back. On command, the arachnid harness sprouts eight enormous spidery legs from these ribs. These legs allow the armor's wearer to attempt Climb checks at full speed without needing to use her hands or feet. Additionally, while the legs are deployed, the armor's wearer doesn't lose her Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing, and need not succeed at a Climb check to avoid falling if she takes damage while climbing.
