Description

Vouchsafing armor grants its wearer DR 5/- while she is unconscious, nauseated, stunned, or pinned. This DR stacks with any other DR the wearer already has. If the wearer is somehow able to take standard actions while unconscious, nauseated, or stunned, or is able to make attacks while pinned, the armor does not grant its DR.
