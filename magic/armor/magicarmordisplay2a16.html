This +1 heavy steel shield is often stylized by its dwarven crafters to look like a door or archway. Once per day after uttering a command word, the wielder can press this shield against a portal to secure it as per the hold portal spell. The shield remains adhered to the portal for 3 minutes, after which the shield comes free. The wielder can remove the shield from her arm as a move action, leaving the shield attached to the portal for the remainder of the duration. Before the end of the duration, the wielder can pull the shield from the portal, automatically ending the effect.
