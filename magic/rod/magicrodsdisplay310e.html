Description

This rod functions as a +1 light mace and resembles the distorted femur of some monstrous creature. Up to three times per day when the wielder damages a creature with the rod, as a free action, the wielder can force the target to attempt a DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature suffers a minor curse. The wielder selects which of the following curses affects the target: -2 penalty to Strength (target's Strength cannot be reduced below 1); -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks; or target has a 20% chance to begin each round with the staggered condition. On a successful critical hit, the wielder can inflict two distinct curses if the target fails its save. Otherwise, a target can be subject to only one curse at a time.

Curses inflicted from the rod of minor curses last for 5 minutes. They can also be removed with any spell that can remove the effects of bestow curse.
