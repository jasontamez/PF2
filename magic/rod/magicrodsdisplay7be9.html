Description

This 3-foot-long, magically reinforced obsidian rod is capped with a globe of volcanic glass at one end, and a gleaming spike at the other. Veins of molten earth glow faintly beneath the rod's surface, flowing from a swirling fiery mass at the orb's core.

Once per day, the spiked end can be driven into sand, mud, or loose earth as a move action, into dense soil or loose gravel as a standard action, or into stone or metal as a full-round action. Once anchored, the earth in a path that is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long cracks and erupts with superheated gases in the direction of the wielder's choosing, originating in a square adjacent to the pyroclastic spike. Creatures standing in the path take 2d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 16 half) from the flaming jets of sulfuric gases as the ground beneath them begins to liquefy.

One round after anchoring the rod, liquid fire begins to pour from the pyroclastic spike along the affected area, creating a molten river 2 feet deep. The pyroclastic flow deals 10d6 points of fire damage to any barriers it encounters until it is able to flow freely forward to the full range of effect. Creatures in the area of effect automatically take 2d6 points of fire damage each round; those falling prone or held under the liquid fire take 10d6 points of fire damage each round. The molten river persists until the pyroclastic spike is removed from the ground as a full-round action, at which point the affected area immediately cools. Any creature in the molten terrain becomes entangled when the rock cools, but may escape with a successful DC 16 Reflex save.
