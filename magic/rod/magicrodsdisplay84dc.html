Description

This gnarled blackwood scepter seeps tar, making it sticky to the touch. Around Cassomir, waterblight scepters are popular among inquisitors, oracles, and witches who regularly ply the Sellen River or the waters of the Inner Sea as members of merchant caravans, pirate crews, or pirate hunters.

The scepter acts as a +1 water-outsider-bane heavy mace. When the scepter is wielded against creatures with the water subtype, damage dealt by the scepter also ignores 10 points of DR. Additionally, the wielder can use water walk once per day for 90 minutes. The duration of this ability need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 10-minute increments.
