Description

The head of this bronze scepter is shaped like a roaring lion leaping forward. When held by a creature with no ranks in the Handle Animal skill, this rod allows the wielder to teach tricks to any animal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 as though the wielder were trained in the use of that skill. Regardless of whether the wielder of a rod of animal training has ranks in Handle Animal, she gains a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal checks to teach a trick to an animal or to train an animal for a general purpose, and the wielder can use charm animal (DC 11) as a spell-like ability three times per day.
