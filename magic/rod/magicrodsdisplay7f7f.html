Description

A famine rod is a 2-foot length of ebony carved in the likeness of a gaunt, emaciated man. As a standard action, the wielder can expend 1 charge to make a ranged touch attack against a foe within 60 feet, dealing 2d6 points of damage on a hit. The wielder gains temporary hit points equal to half of the damage the rod deals. The temporary hit points disappear 1 hour later. The wielder can expend 3 charges to deal 4d6 points of damage instead.

A famine rod has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed once per week, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 1-week period.
