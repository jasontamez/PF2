Description

This bejeweled scepter constantly emits a low hum that amplifies the wielder's voice. A booming scepter acts as a +1 thundering light mace that grants the wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and the ability to use shout, as per the spell, once per day. When a booming scepter is held in both hands, the wielder's voice carries far enough to be heard by all creatures within 1 mile, regardless of ambient noise or intervening obstacles, although this feature cannot penetrate the area of a silence spell.

Construction

Requirements Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Craft Rod, shout, ventriloquism; Cost 17,000 gp
