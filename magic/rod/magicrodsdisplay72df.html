Description

Slightly smaller and shorter than vril staves (see page 255), hollow rods are hollow silver tubes covered in intricate glyphs and small, flute-like keys. Three times per day, a kineticist can utilize the hollow rod in conjunction with a blast wild talent or the kinetic healer wild talent to augment that talent's destructive or healing capabilities, treating the wild talent as maximized. A hollow rod can't be used on a wild talent affected by metakinesis.
