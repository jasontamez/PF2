Description

This ornate, adamantine rod appears to be a cross between a halberd and a strange scepter of alien design. Despite its rigid appearance, the rod is surprisingly flexible and can extend in combat-the weapon functions as a +3 keen adamantine halberd that has reach but can still function normally against adjacent foes. As a full-round action up to five times per day, the rod can be used to fire razors. Treat these as +3 keen adamantine arrows fired from a longbow (any feats possessed by the user that function with longbows work with these flechettes).
