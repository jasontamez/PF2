Description

This black poker has a cherry-red tip, as though fresh from a searing fire. The more artful interrogators ofCheliax well understand that their subjects soon learn to welcome unconsciousness and even death as a means to escape torture. To frustrate their victim's respite, a torturer's wracking rod delivers a painful jolt that keeps the target alert for an extended session of interrogation. On a successful touch attack, the victim receives the benefit of a cure light wounds spell (ld8+1) but must also make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 2d4 rounds. Over the decades, desperate members of Cheliax's underclass have found that these rods double as black market sources of emergency healing. A wracking rod can be used up to 5 times per day.
