Description

An ashen shaft with a steel blade, this finely crafted masterwork shortspear holds a removable shard of carnelian at its base. By crushing the gem as a move action, the spear explodes as per the spell fireball. This detonation is centered on the spear and deals 5d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius spread. The spear's bearer or allies are not immune to this damage (unless they have immunity to fire from another source) and the weapon is destroyed.

A sacrificial spear can be detonated at a range by spending a full-round action to throw the spear and crush the gem. If the attack roll hits the target, the fireball is centered on the target, otherwise refer to the thrown weapons chart to determine where the spear lands (PH 158). Each spear has a specific shard attuned to it at the time of its creation, which can be removed or reaffixed to its spear as a standard action.
