Description

This Huge, double-bitted stone axe, or
labrys, is carved entirely of hematite,
with a wooden shaft covered in fur. It
functions as a +3 stone impact greataxe
that automatically resizes to match the
size of its wielder, from Small to Huge
size. The hematite that composes the
axe is as strong as iron, and doesn't have
the fragile quality. Once per day, the labrys of the stone idol can
be struck against the ground to create a powerful tremor, as the
earthquake spell. When used in this way, the labrys creates a
shield around its wielder, protecting him from the immediate
effects of the earthquake, including fissures, falling rubble,
and landslides. This shield disappears after 1 round, when the
earthquake's effects end.
