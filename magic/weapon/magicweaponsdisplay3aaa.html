Description

A shattering weapon functions as a breaking weapon that also explodes with a resounding crash upon striking a successful critical hit. In addition to the extra damage from the breaking ability, a shattering weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of damage to objects and crystalline creatures on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, it deals an extra 2d10 points of damage instead, and if the multiplier is x4, it deals an extra 3d10 points instead. When used against a crystalline creature, this damage stacks with bane and similar weapon special abilities (though the damage from the breaking ability still doesn't).

Even if the breaking ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra damage on a successful critical hit. A shattering weapon ignores the hardness of objects with a hardness of 10 or lower.
