Description

An artful rapier with a lotus petal guard, this magnificent weapon dedicated to Arazni's former incarnation is useful to warriors and artists alike.

The tip of this narrow +3 rapier can be used as a mundane writing instrument, producing any color of ink the wielder desires. Once per day as a free action when the wielder confirms a critical hit against a creature with the Red Crusader's quill, she can inscribe an <a href="spelldisplay6cc8.html?ItemName=arcane%20mark">arcane mark</a> on the creature. Once per month, the wielder can instead inscribe a <a href="spelldisplay52d9.html?ItemName=mark%20of%20justice">mark of justice</a>; this mark ends immediately if the wielder inscribes another <a href="spelldisplay52d9.html?ItemName=mark%20of%20justice">mark of justice</a> with the Red Crusader's quill.
