Description

When Xin learned that the runelords had invested their champions with the swords known as the Alara-hai-the Swords of Sin-he decided that he deserved such a weapon for his champion as well. Unfortunately, his attempt to create an eighth Alara-hai failed. Despite his skill and power, Xin simply couldn't equal even the least of the other Swords of Sin, a truth that vexed and humiliated him. The weapon he created, the ghost iron scimitar, was a significant weapon, but it was hardly an artifact. It wasn't even intelligent. Ashamed of the weapon, but secretly harboring the hope that someday he-d figure out how to improve it, Xin secreted the sword away in a Skymetal Vault and forgot about it.

The ghost iron scimitar is a +2 dancing keen ghost touch inubrix scimitar. The weapon has been magically enhanced so that it still deals normal weapon damage for its size and is not treated as being broken, despite being made from a soft skymetal. It ignores armor and shield bonuses granted by metal objects. Although the weapon cannot damage metal creatures (and is thus not very effective against the clockwork reliquary), it can be presented to the clockwork reliquary as an example of one of Xin's failures to aid in triggering its unstable mind.
