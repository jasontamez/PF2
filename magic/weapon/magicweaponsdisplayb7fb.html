Description

This +3 longsword is a variant luck blade (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 157). It grants its wielder a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. Once per day, its possessor can reroll one d20 roll that he just made, before the results of the original roll are revealed. He must take the results of the reroll, even if they are worse. This reroll power is an extraordinary ability. Finally, Pale Maiden can hold up to three wishes, as a luck blade. When the last wish is used, Pale Maiden remains a +3 longsword, still grants the +1 luck bonus on saving throws, and still grants the daily use of its reroll power.
