Description

This +1 sling bullet contains a magical reservoir that can store a single vial of any alchemical substance capable of being used as a splash weapon. If the alchemist bullet hits, the splash weapon also strikes the target and causes splash damage as normal. If the alchemist's bullet misses but is not destroyed, the alchemical substance remains stored within, and the bullet does not explode and can be reused. If it misses and is destroyed, the bullet is destroyed as well without effect.
