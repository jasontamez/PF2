Description

A treasonous weapon functions
as a patriotic weapon, but
when wielded against a
member of the nationality to
which it is attuned, the weapon's
enhancement bonus is +2 better
than its actual bonus. It also
deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against members of the
designated nationality. This extra damage is not multiplied on
a critical hit.
