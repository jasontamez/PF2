Description

A 2-foot-long blade extends from the heavy crossbar of this +1 boar spear. Designed to catch and hold humanoid prey, a spear of manhunting automatically resizes to match the size of its wielder when grasped. Once per day on a successful critical hit, the wielder of a spear of manhunting can cast hold person as an immediate action on the target hit by the attack (Will DC 13 negates). The hold person effect immediately ends if the spear is dropped or withdrawn, such as by making additional attacks with the weapon.
