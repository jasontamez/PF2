Description

A skull and partial backbone carved from ivory top this +2 sword cane (Advanced Player’s Guide 179), and gray sharkskin covers its wooden scabbard. The wielder can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply her Dexterity modifier instead of her Strength modifier to attack rolls with a scoundrel’s sword cane sized for her, even though it isn’t a light weapon.

The eyes of the skull atop the scoundrel’s sword cane constantly enhance the wielder’s awareness, granting the wielder a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. In addition, once per day, the wielder can concentrate while holding the cane to see through the skull’s eyes as if they were her own. In effect, the scoundrel’s sword cane can be used as a periscope, allowing the wielder to safely peer over obstacles or around corners. If the wielder has total concealment from an observed creature except for the end of the cane, the wielder uses the skull’s Diminutive size modifier for her Stealth check instead of her own size modifier.
