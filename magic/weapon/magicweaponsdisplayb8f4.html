Description

The long blade of this weapon bears shifting black and yellow patterns, resembling the markings of a wasp. This +1 heartseeker elven curve blade has three slots built into the hilt for storing doses of poison. Adding or removing a dose of poison from the blade is a swift action that requires a free hand.

Any creatures struck by a Calistrian kiss take a -4 penalty on any saving throw against the poison applied to the weapon. The frequency of any poison applied to the Calistrian kiss increases by 2 (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with a skill or magic take a -4 penalty.
