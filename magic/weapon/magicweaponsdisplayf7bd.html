Description

This special ability can be placed only on melee weapons. When a fate-stealing weapon strikes a creature that possesses either grit or panache, the wielder can steal 1 grit point or panache point as a swift action. When the wielder steals a grit or panache point, she can regain 1 grit point or 1 panache point (if the wielder has any). The wielder can use a foe's grit to restore her own panache, or use a foe's panache to restore her own grit.

If the wielder attempts to use this ability against a foe that isn't a grit or panache user, or that currently has no points of grit or panache remaining, the wielder doesn't expend an action, and the attempt fails.
