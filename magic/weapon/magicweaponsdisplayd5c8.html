Description

Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of this +1 short sword can appear as a specific humanoid enemy the blade has injured within the previous 7 minutes. The target must be within one size category of the wielder. The wielder can appear as that humanoid for up to 7 minutes and can dismiss the effect as a free action. Anyone interacting with the wielder of a doppelganger's sword who is familiar with the impersonated humanoid can attempt a DC 14 Will saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.
