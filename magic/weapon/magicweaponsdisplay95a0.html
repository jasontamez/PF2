Description

This +1 heavy wrist launcher appears to be a lavish, gold bracelet. This functions like the glamered weapon special ability (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 142), except a biting bracelet is able to only assume this one specific form, and can revert to its innocuous appearance 1 round after being used as a weapon.
