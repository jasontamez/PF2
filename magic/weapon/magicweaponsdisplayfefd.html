Description

Carved from a single chunk of magically strengthened mineral salts, a natron fang is a +1 khopesh ( Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 30) forged to combat the undead, specifically mummies and incorporeal undead. A natron fang overcomes the damage reduction of mummies, mummified creatures, and other mummy-like creatures at the GM's discretion. Once per day on a successful strike against an incorporeal undead creature, a natron fang also deals 1d6 points of Charisma damage (Will DC 13 half) in addition to the weapon's normal damage.
