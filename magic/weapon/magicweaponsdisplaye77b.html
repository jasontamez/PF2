Description

The stock and bow of this +1 distance hand crossbow are decorated with the golden head of an osprey, sea eagle, or other avian creature. Three times per day, a skyrocket crossbow can imbue one of two special abilities on its ammunition.

The first causes a bolt fired from the crossbow to explode in a dazzling burst of colored light when it hits a creature or object, or if it reaches its maximum range increment (600 feet). Creatures within a 10-foot radius of the target point are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful DC 13 Will save means a creature is dazzled for 1 minute instead. Sightless creatures, or those without line of sight to the target point, are unaffected.

The second ability causes a bolt fired from the crossbow to function as a screaming bolt (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 475).
