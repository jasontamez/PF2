Description

A creature wielding one of these +1 longspears-which are favored gifts of House Thrune-gains a +3 bonus on attack rolls when flanking with an evil-aligned outsider, instead of +2. A creature using the longspear's reach to attack through a square occupied by an allied evil-aligned outsider ignores any cover bonus the fiend would grant to the target.
