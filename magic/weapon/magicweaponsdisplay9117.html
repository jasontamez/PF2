Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons. A flying creature hit with a plummeting weapon must immediately attempt a DC 20 Fly check with a penalty equal to twice the weapon's enhancement bonus; if it fails, it loses 10 feet of altitude. On a confirmed critical hit, the creature loses 10 feet of altitude if it succeeds at its Fly check, and it falls 1d4??10 feet on a failed check. If a flying creature's loss of altitude results in it striking the ground or another solid surface, it takes falling damage as appropriate and is no longer flying.
