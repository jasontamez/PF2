Description

This +1 adamantine swordbreaker dagger (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 38) has a jagged ebon blade inscribed with ancient Thassilonian runes that translate to "cut down to size." Three times per day, when the wielder successfully sunders a weapon using a shrivelblade, he can permanently reduce the size of the sundered weapon by one size category, thus reducing its damage and its intended wielder size by one size category and its weight by half. Using this ability is a swift action. If the sundered weapon is magical, it can attempt a DC 14 Will save to negate this effect. Multiple uses of this ability don't stack. A make whole spell can return a weapon shrunken by a shrivelblade to its proper size.
