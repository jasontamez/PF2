Description

The lash of this whip is made of countless tiny chitinous plates interlocking to form an articulated cord, tipped with sharp blades. A scorpion tail whip is a +2 scorpion whip that can strike with incredible speed. When attacking with the scorpion tail whip, the wielder gains a +2 insight bonus on his initiative check, provided his first attack on the first round of combat is made with the scorpion tail whip. If the wielder switches weapons or makes an attack with another weapon before attacking with the scorpion tail whip, he does not gain the initiative bonus.
