Description

The starknife of the void is a
weapon designed by devotees of
Black Butterfly and at one time
could only be found among the
faithful of her mystery cults. Over
time, these weapons fell into the
hands of those outside the cult, and
now they crop up in odd places-
sealed vaults, underground treasure caches, the bottom of the
sea-but always places where there is darkness and stillness.

The starknife of the void is a +2 returning starknife. If the
wielder scores a critical hit against a foe with a starknife of
the void, it discharges a blindness/deafness spell affecting the
creature struck. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude
save or be struck blind or deaf (as chosen by the wielder of
the starknife of the void). If the starknife of the void deals
more than one critical hit to the same target, the target can
potentially become both blind and deaf.
