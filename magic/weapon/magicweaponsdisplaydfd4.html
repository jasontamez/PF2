Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons. Three times per day as a swift action, the wielder can activate a glitterwake weapon to cause her next ranged attack with the weapon to scatter a wake of glittering dust. The dust clings to the target struck and all creatures within 10 feet of the attack's trajectory, and all creatures affected by the dust take a -20 penalty on Stealth checks while the dust persists. The dust also outlines invisible creatures and objects as glitterdust. Creatures in the area of glittering dust when the attack is made are dazzled unless they succeed at a DC 13 Will save. The dust lasts a number of minutes equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus.
