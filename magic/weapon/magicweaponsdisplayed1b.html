Description

This +1 unholy scorpion whip ( Ultimate Combat 144) is fashioned from skin flayed from a barbed devil's back. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. A shaken creature struck by the hellscourge must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A frightened or panicked creature struck must instead save or cower for 1d4 rounds. Both of these are mind-affecting fear effects.

If wielded by a person who wears hamatula hide armor, the hellscourge functions as a +1 flaming unholy whip. Such a wielder can lash the whip once per day to hurl flames as a scorching ray (creating two rays); doing so extinguishes the whip's flames until the next day.
