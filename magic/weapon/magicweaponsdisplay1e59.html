Description

The bullets fired by this +2
Maxim M1910 machine gun
(see page 65) are enhanced
to pierce protective cover,
allowing the wielder to
ignore the AC bonus granted
to targets by anything less
than total cover. A Maxim
of suppressive fire can make
attacks against targets with total cover, but the wielder must
still guess the correct square of its target's location, and the
target still benefits from total concealment (50% miss chance).
