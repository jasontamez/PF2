Once per day, the wielder of a snakebite dagger can speak the weapon's command word to cause the dagger to seep a bright green neurotoxin. For 1 hour, the next time the wielder damages a creature with the dagger, the creature must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be affected by modify memory as if the wielder had spent 5 minutes modifying the target's memory.
