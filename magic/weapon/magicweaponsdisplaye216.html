Description

These weapons were first created by deities and given to mortals so that they could combat mythic foes. When the wielder confirms a critical hit against a mythic creature with a disjoining weapon, the target loses the ability to expend its mythic power for 1d4 rounds. A mythic creature wielding a disjoining weapon loses the ability to expend uses of mythic power for as long as he wields the weapon. Only melee weapons can have this ability.
