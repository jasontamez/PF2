Description

A summon bane weapon excels against summoned creatures, including those summoned by conjuration (summoning) spells (such as summon monster and summon nature's ally spells), those summoned by conjuration (calling) spells (such as planar ally and planar binding), and eidolons. Against such summoned creatures, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than its normal bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against such foes.
