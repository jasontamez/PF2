Description

Molded and crafted from a single large chunk of raw iron ore, this +1 thundering earth breaker is as cool as loose soil to the touch. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder may slam an earthcracker against the ground, causing earth and stone to rise and fall in a violent wave that travels in a 30-foot line from the wielder's location. All of the affected squares become difficult terrain. The wielder can perform a free trip combat maneuver on a single creature within the affected squares; this attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the wielder is not knocked prone if the attempt fails. If the trip combat maneuver check is a natural 20, the blow is so mighty that it also deals 2d8 points of sonic damage to the target.
