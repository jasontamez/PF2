Description

Brine’s Sting is a slim +1 rapier with a hilt guard in the shape of a writhing purple sea snake. On a successful hit that deals damage, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1 round as salty brine drips painfully onto the wound. A new saving throw must be made each time the weapon deals damage. On a successful critical hit against a creature with the aquatic or water subtype, the target takes an additional 3d6 points of damage as its flesh cracks and withers from dehydration as salt crystals form around the wound.
