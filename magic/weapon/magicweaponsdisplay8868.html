Description

This +1 boarding pike (Pathfinder Player Companion: Pirates of the Inner Sea 18) is an 8-foot-long pole topped with a tapered metal spearpoint and a backward-facing hook, used to draw vessels closer together or repel boarders. A metal skull caps the butt of the pike. On command, a boarding pike of repelling can be extended as a swift action, giving its wielder a reach of 20 feet for 1 round. While the pike is extended, the wielder does not threaten adjacent creatures or creatures up to 15 feet away. A boarding pike of repelling can also be extended in this way to draw vessels closer together for boarding.
