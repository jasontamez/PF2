Description

This special ability can be placed only on bludgeoning melee weapons. Whenever the wielder deals critical hit damage or sneak attack damage with an obliviating weapon, the victim loses all memory of the previous 1d6 minutes unless it succeeds at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw. If it fails the saving throw, it becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.
