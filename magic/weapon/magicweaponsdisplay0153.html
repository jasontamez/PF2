Description

Carved to look like the bones of fish, the barrel and mechanical components of this blunderbuss are made of mithral. A depth charger is a +2 reliable blunderbuss that gains an additional +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls against creatures with the aquatic subtype, and deals an additional 2d6 points of damage to such creatures with a successful attack. All ammunition used by a depth charger is considered to have the dry load weapon special ability in addition to any other magical enhancements it previously contained.

When a depth charger is wielded underwater, it enables its wielder to breathe normally. The wielder can continue to breathe underwater for a total of 12 hours as long as she continues to hold the blunderbuss. These hours do not have to be consecutive but must be used in 1-hour increments. The available breathing time is reset only if a depth charger is kept dry for 12 continuous hours.
