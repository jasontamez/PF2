Description

A debilitating weapon has wicked ridges and gleams maliciously in any amount of light. Whenever a debilitating weapon is used to attack an opponent that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC and hits, that opponent takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls or to its AC for 1 round (wielder's choice). Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to this penalty, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the penalties imposed by a debilitating weapon. Multiple hits from multiple debilitating weapons in the same round do not increase the penalty or its duration.

If the wielder has the debilitating injury (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 22) class ability, this special ability increases the penalty applied by the bewildered or disoriented effects by 1.
