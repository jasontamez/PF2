Description

This +2 lance is made out of white spruce wood with a handle carved from mammoth tusk ivory. Its shaft is decorated with images of charging mammoths or running wolves. Traditionally, the owner of a mammoth lance adorns the weapon with small trophies attached via short leather strips or carves notches in the shaft to represent triumphs. When wielded while mounted on a creature with the animal type, a mammoth lance uses the mount's Strength modifier on damage rolls rather than the wielder's Strength modifier.

When its wielder is not mounted, or is mounted on a creature without the animal type, a mammoth lance functions as a normal +2 lance.
