Description

The blade of this +1 transformative scimitar is adorned with gemstones that shift in size and coloration. An erratic blade provides the wielder with some control over the fickle nature of wild magic. While the scimitar is held in the hand, the wielder gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to prevent a spell or spell-like ability from going awry because of a plane's wild magic trait. If the wielder's spell or spell-like ability goes awry anyway, he rolls twice on Table 2-1: Wild Magic Effects and chooses which result occurs. Also, when an erratic blade damages a creature, that creature takes a -4 penalty for 1 round on caster level checks to prevent a spell or spell-like ability from going awry because of a plane's wild magic trait. The effects of multiple hits from an erratic blade don't stack.
