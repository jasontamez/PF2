Description

When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a confounding weapon, she can spend 1 panache point to attempt a combat maneuver to disarm, reposition, sunder, or trip the target as an immediate action, gaining an enhancement bonus on the combat maneuver check equal to the enhancement bonus of the confounding weapon. This combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The wielder can't use panache gained by confirming the critical hit to activate this ability.
