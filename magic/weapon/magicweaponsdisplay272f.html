Description

This +2 elysian bronze spear is capable of warping space to strike faraway targets as if they stood within arm's reach. As a standard action, the farspear's wielder can make a single melee attack against a creature within 60 feet as though it were within his melee reach. Cover and concealment apply as if making a ranged attack. The wielder can use any Vital Strike feat he has as part of this melee attack. The Spiresworn based these weapons upon the legendary Azlanti farspears, artifacts created by the warrior goddess Acavna that allowed wielders to strike from leagues away.
