Description

Often created by evangelistic clerics of Milani, an Everbloom's rose is a +1 morningstar. Once per day, the wielder of an Everbloom's rose can cast remove fear on a creature touched by the weapon. If the subject succeeds at a saving throw against a fear effect while under effects of this spell, the subject gains a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the source of the fear effect for 1 round. If the subject is immune to fear effects, she gains no bonuses from this effect.
