Description

This oversized hammer crackles with chaotic energy. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of this +1 anarchic warhammer can strike the ground to create the effects of the chaos hammer spell (Will DC 16, CL 9th) that bursts out from the warhammer's wielder. A mythic creature wielding this weapon can expend one use of mythic power to activate this ability without using up its daily use.
