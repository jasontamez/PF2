Description

This +2 light crossbow is made of silver that never needs to be polished. A mage's crossbow is especially effective against creatures with spell resistance. Against such creatures, the weapon's effective enhancement bonus increases to +3, and it deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. Whenever the wielder casts a spell that requires him to make a ranged touch attack (such as a ray) while he has the crossbow in hand, he gains a bonus on his ranged attack roll equal to the crossbow's enhancement bonus against the target creature. If the spell hits, the caster also applies this bonus to the caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any) and on the spell's damage roll (if any).
