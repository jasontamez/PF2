Description

This +1 cutlass is constantly soaked with brine. The wielder's attacks with a cutlass of waves don't take penalties from being underwater, as if the cutlass were a piercing weapon. While a creature holds the cutlass in its hand, a low-cresting wave of water carries the cutlass's holder along the deck of a ship or through the water, otherwise as per slipstream.
