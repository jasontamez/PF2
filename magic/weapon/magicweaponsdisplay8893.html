Description

These mithral +2 defending bastard swords are favored blades of the Eagle Knights. Easily recognized by its eagle's-head pommel and golden quillons crafted like upswept eagle wings, a talonstrike sword's defending special ability also protects the wielder's mount. Once per day when the wielder confirms a critical hit with a talonstrike sword, the wielder can cast dimensional anchor on the target as a free action.
