Description

A weapon with the rusting special ability is so badly tarnished that no amount of cleaning can restore it. Although the weapon constantly sheds flecks of rust and corroded metal, it remains structurally sound. When the wielder confirms a critical hit with a rusting weapon, she can forgo any extra damage to instead deal normal damage to the target and affect the target or the target's armor with the rusting grasp spell. A rusting weapon cannot be used against unattended inanimate objects. A rusting weapon is immune to mundane or magical rust, including the attack of a rust monster.
