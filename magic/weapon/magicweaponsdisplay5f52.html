Description

This special ability can be placed only on a melee weapon. A truthful weapon unerringly pierces concealment provided by illusions, allowing the wielder to ignore the miss chance provided by illusions such as blur, displacement, and invisibility. Attacks with a truthful weapon against a creature affected by mirror image or a similar figment always attack the real target. This ability allows the wielder to ignore the miss chance, not to otherwise detect the target. When attacking an invisible creature, for instance, the wielder might still need to guess the target's location.

In addition to its other abilities, a truthful weapon functions as a special kind of dispelling weapon against figments and shadow conjuration effects; if the wielder makes an attack against such an effect, the weapon automatically attempts to use the stored dispel magic against the illusion. If the attempt fails, the wielder is not aware of the attempt, and unless she disbelieves the illusion or the illusion's duration ends, the weapon continues to impart that it is storing dispel magic (though she is free to cast dispel magic on the weapon again if she has another reason to believe the effect was expended and failed to dispel an illusion).
