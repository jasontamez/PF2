Description

A closing offer is a rusty +2 shortsword with a thin, unblemished section along the center of the blade. Inscribing the surname of a humanoid on that section attunes the sword to its family, causing it to act as a bane weapon against that family line. Anytime a marked target takes damage from this blade, the wielder can ask a single question that must have a yes/no response. If the target succeeds at a DC 14 Will save, she can ignore the question; otherwise, she must answer it truthfully. A closing offer can be re-attuned to a new family name via a ritual that takes 8 hours to complete and requires 200 gp in alchemical reagents.
