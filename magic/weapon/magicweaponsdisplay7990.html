Description

A heretical weapon functions as a
fervent weapon, but when wielded
against a member of the religion to
which it is attuned, the weapon's
enhancement bonus is +2 better
than its actual bonus. It also deals an
extra 2d6 points of damage against
followers of the designated religion.
This extra damage is not multiplied on
a critical hit.
