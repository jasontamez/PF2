Description

A sadist's lash is a long whip of thin strips of leather. Created originally by a special sect of wizards who served under Runelord Sorshen, sadist's lashes swiftly became quite popular throughout Thassilon. The lash acts as a +1 wounding whip, and also aids enchantment spells in two ways. First, it can deliver enchantment spells with a range of touch as if the wielder had touched the creature struck. Additionally, any creature that takes damage from a sadist's lash takes a -5 penalty on Will saves against all enchantment effects created by the wielder of the lash for 1 minute unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Will save.
