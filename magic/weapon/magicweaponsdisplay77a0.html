Description

This wicked-looking +2 adamantine spiked chain is favored by those who associate with kytons. When used to perform a disarm or trip combat maneuver, the chain partly animates to grasp the target, granting a +4 bonus on the combat maneuver check. On a successful disarm or trip combat maneuver check, the chain deals damage to the target creature or weapon as if it had also hit with an attack (in addition to the maneuver's effects).
