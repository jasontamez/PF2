Description

Adapted from the weapons of the Clicking Caverns' mysterious clockwork soldiers, this +1 keen short sword is modified with ticking clockwork components. Technomagical internal mechanisms help the blade strike true when it would otherwise deliver a glancing blow. Once per day, when the wielder deals sneak attack or precision damage with this weapon, she can reroll the sneak attack or precision damage dice after the damage is rolled, but before the damage is applied. When the damage dice are rerolled with this ability, they are reduced by one step (for example, d6s become d4s, and d8s become d6s).
