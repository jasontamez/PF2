Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons. Veering weapons feature feathers or carved images of wings or winged creatures in their construction. Attacks with a veering weapon ignore a target's bonus to AC from partial cover and reduce the target's bonus to AC from cover and soft cover by 2. A veering weapon bestows no benefit against targets with total cover.
