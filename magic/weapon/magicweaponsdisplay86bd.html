Description

Many stories feature Luthier, Knight of the Vineyard, champion of good and Cayden Cailean's trusted ally. These legends often mention Luthier's elegant rapier, and while the original Luthier's rapier undoubtedly remains with its owner, copies surface from time to time-usually when a faithful follower of Cayden Cailean requires assistance.

Rose-hued steel forms the length of the blade, and gold flowers seem to blossom in the filigreed basket-hilt. A large ruby glimmers at the hilt's center. Luthier's rapier is a +1 holy rapier. Once per day, you can activate the power of the ruby embedded in the rapier's hilt to gain a +4 sacred bonus to Charisma and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. These bonuses last for 10 minutes.

Also, once, you can command the gem to shatter in an explosion of red light. Every creature except you within 30 feet must make a DC 20 Will save or be dazed for 3 rounds. Once you shatter the gem in this fashion, the rapier becomes just a normal +1 rapier.
