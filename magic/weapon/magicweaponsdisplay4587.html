Description

Containing the bound essence of a troll warlord, this matched pair of +1 vicious heavy picks rends flesh with horrifying efficiency. Each pick is a darkwood shaft pierced by a weathered tusk. The ends of the picks are connected with a cord of dried sinew. This cord is long enough that the picks can be wielded with one in each hand. A wielder holding only one of the picks can recover its mate with a swift action as though the unattended pick were on a weapon cord.

If the wielder hits an opponent with both picks in the same round, the picks additionally deal 1d4 points of bleed damage.
