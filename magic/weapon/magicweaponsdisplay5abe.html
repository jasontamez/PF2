Description

This long piece of cloth is so fine that it can pass through a finger ring. Delicately woven with multiple colors to spell out Iroran prayers, it is usually worn as a shawl or belt, or wrapped around the chest and shoulders-it does not use a magic item body slot. If wrapped around at least one limb, it grants the wearer the Improved Unarmed Strike feat. It may also be wielded as a +1 whip. The wearer can meditate on the shawl's sacred mantras to use cure light wounds and know the enemy each once per day.
