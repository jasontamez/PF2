Description

This +2 cruel furyborn scimitar was created accidentally by Treerazer when the demon lord plunged the glaistig Hephloma's scimitar through her own chest. Images of shriveled vines and wilted flowers decorate its blade. Three times per day as an immediate action after dealing damage to a creature, the wielder can cause the blighted plant life depicted on the blade to animate, embedding thorny vines in the creature's wounds. The creeping, twisting vines cause the creature to become entangled for 1d4 rounds, and it is nauseated by the pain while the entangled condition persists. A successful DC 22 Fortitude saving throw negates the nauseated condition.
