Description

This +2 cold iron bastard sword becomes a +2 unholy cold iron bastard sword in the hands of an antipaladin sworn to the demon lord Nocticula. In the hands of a good creature, Iron Lash bestows one permanent negative level as though it were unholy while granting none of the associated benefits of the unholy special ability.

Once per day, the wielder of this sword can cast finger of death with a range of 60 feet, dealing 150 points of damage on a successful hit. If the target succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw, the attack instead deals 3d6+15 points of damage. This is a death effect.
