Description

An igniting weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also causes the target to catch fire (Core Rulebook 444) upon striking it with a successful critical hit. The target does not get a saving throw to avoid catching fire, but can make a save each round on its turn to put out the fire. The flaming ability must be active for the weapon to set enemies on fire.
