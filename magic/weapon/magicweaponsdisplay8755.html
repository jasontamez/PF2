Description

Forged with a wicked barbed end that
resembles a key, this +2 redeemed
longsword was once the unholy
sword of a diabolist-before a party
of adventurers retrieved it from his
corpse and repurposed the weapon
for good. The devil's key is designed
to permanently slay evil outsiders by
bringing the fight to their plane of
origin so they can be killed outright.
Once per day as a swift action after a successful attack against
an evil outsider, the wielder can activate the sword to plane
shift the wielder and the target of the attack to the creature's
home plane. The targeted outsider can resist this effect with
a successful DC 20 Will save. Once the target of this ability is
slain by the wielder, the sword activates another plane shift
as an immediate action that brings the wielder back to the
exact spot it previously left.
