Description

Weapons with this special ability cause foes struck by them to have exceptional difficulty controlling their magic. Any time a creature that has been struck by a greater distracting weapon would have to succeed at a concentration check to complete a spell or use a special ability or item, the DC of that check increases by 10. This distraction lasts for 1 minute. Once a greater distracting weapon affects a creature in this way, that creature can't be affected by a distracting or greater distracting effect for 24 hours. If a greater distracting weapon is used on a creature already affected by a distracting weapon's effect, the two effects do not stack; the distracting effect ends, and the creature is affected by the greater distracting weapon's effect instead.
