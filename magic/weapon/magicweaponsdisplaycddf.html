Description

This +1 flaming scimitar has golden flames embossed along the blade, which flicker and glow even when the sword's flames are extinguished. Three times per day as a swift action, its wielder can transform the sword into a blade of pure flame. In this form, the blade deals 1d8+9 points of fire damage (as the flame blade spell).

Once per day, the sword's wielder can expend one use of mythic power to transform the blade into a Large fire elemental for 10 minutes. When the duration ends or the fire elemental is defeated, the blade reappears in its owner's hands.
