Description

When the wielder of an exclusionary weapon damages a creature with it, she can choose to not affect that creature with any channel energy ability she uses within the next minute. The maximum number of targets the wielder can exclude at one time is equal to her Wisdom bonus plus the enhancement bonus of the exclusionary weapon. If the wielder of an exclusionary weapon strikes a creature that would cause her to go over this limit, she loses the ability to exclude the target she has been excluding for the longest amount of time.
