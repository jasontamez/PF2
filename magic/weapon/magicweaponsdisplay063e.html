Description

The sickly gray wood of this arrow seems quite fragile and delicate. Created from pale necromantic bone or casket wood, this arrow splinters when it impacts, embedding pieces of itself in the target and making the wound resistant to magical healing. Removing the splinters requires 10 minutes and a DC 25 Heal check. Until the splinters are removed, all magical healing effects used on the target restore only half as many hit points as normal. This applies whether the target requires positive or negative energy for healing.
