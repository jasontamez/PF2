Description

Originally made from the winding intestines of a scrag, the first version of this +2 corrosive whip was crafted by a blood-bard who fought in Green Blood on a Black Rock. After the blood-bard's stunning victory, these weapons have gained popularity across the Sodden Lands and Shackles. Unless damaged by fire, a greenblood scourge regenerates hit points at a rate of 1 hit point per minute.

In performance combat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 153), the wielder of a greenblood scourge can spend a victory point as a swift action to give the weapon the corrosive burst special ability. Also, the wielder no longer needs to attempt a performance combat check when using the withdraw action during performance combat, as the weapon's blasts of acid prevent the enemy from approaching.
