Description

An unnaturally cold, razor-thin blade of magically-hardened ice juts from the pommel of this +1 <a href="magicweaponsdisplayc7e5.html?ItemName=Frost">frost</a> <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7362.html?ItemName=Keen">keen</a> short sword. On a confirmed critical hit, an ice shard breaks off into the wound and inflicts numbing cold. For the next 5 rounds, the victim takes 2 points of cold damage and is staggered for that round if he takes this damage. This is a bleed effect. The shard can be removed as a standard action with a successful DC 15 Heal check or with the application of any magical healing, and is destroyed instantly if the victim takes at least 5 points of fire damage from any attack. The shard lasts for only 1 round when inflicted on a creature with the fire subtype. A blade of the ice stalker can implant an ice shard once per minute.
