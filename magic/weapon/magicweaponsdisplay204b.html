Description

This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. A weapon with the pitfall quality gives you a heightened danger sense. When holding a pitfall weapon, apply the weapon's enhancement bonus to your initiative checks, Reflex saves made to avoid traps, and AC against attacks made by traps. For example, a +5 pitfall longsword gives you a +5 bonus to initiative, +5 to Reflex saves made to avoid traps, and a +5 bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. Wielding two weapons with the pitfall weapon quality only grants the bonuses from the better weapon.
