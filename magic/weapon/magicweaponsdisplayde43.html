Description

This heavy whip features Pharasmin imagery on its silver handle. The Lady's spiral is a +1 ghost touch undead-bane whip that deals lethal damage to undead creatures regardless of their armor bonus or natural armor bonus.

In addition, the handle of a Lady's spiral can be wielded as a +1 silver stake. This stake has the same statistics and properties as a wooden stake, except it is made of silver and thus overcomes DR/silver. Though it's effectively two weapons in one, a Lady's spiral is not a double weapon and cannot be wielded as one.
