Description

This exquisitely detailed +3 nodachi (Ultimate Combat 133) comes sheathed in a black-lacquered scabbard with gold filigree. Its hilt is wrapped in red dragonhide, and a single golden feather hangs from the pommel. Karusetsu enables its wielder to execute a flourishing slash three times per day in the direction of a single distant opponent (i.e., one not already engaged in melee combat with the wielder) up to 60 feet away. This flourishing slash projects a plane of scintillating force across the intervening distance, functioning as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon using the wielder's highest base attack bonus. On a successful hit, the blade's cutting light deals 4d6+3 points of force damage to the target, with a threat range of 18-20 and a critical multiplier of x2. In addition, a creature struck by the cutting light must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
