Description

This special ability can only be added to ranged projectile weapons (including slings and sling-like weapons). Black smoke constantly wafts from the firing mechanism of a shadowshooting weapon. A shadowshooting weapon never needs to be reloaded; after a shot is fired, this smoke immediately coalesces into the ammunition required to fire the weapon again. This doesn't prevent a shadowshooting weapon from firing ordinary projectiles appropriate to the weapon.

Ammunition created by this ability is only quasi-real, and the first time each round an opponent is hit by a piece of ammunition that this ability has created, it can attempt a Will saving throw to disbelieve (DC = 15 + the weapon's enhancement bonus). A failed Will saving throw means the weapon deals damage normally, while success means the weapon deals minimum damage against that opponent for 1 round.
