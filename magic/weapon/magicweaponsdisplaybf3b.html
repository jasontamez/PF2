Description

This +1 dagger is jet black and appears to drip grains of sand from its blade. Once per day as an immediate action when the wielder unsuccessfully attacks, he can activate the dagger to disappear in a whirlwind of black sand. The wielder teleports as per dimension door to any unoccupied square within 30 feet and can attempt a Stealth check to hide as if he were not being observed. The wielder cannot take any other creatures with him when he activates the dagger. Activating the dagger does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
