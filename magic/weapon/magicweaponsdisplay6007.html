Description

Born from dwarven forges, these +1 giant-bane dwarven waraxes are crafted in the likeness of the favored weapon of King Harral, the last king of the Pious Kingdom of Saggorak. According to legend, before he and his comrades starved to death during the orc siege of Saggorak, King Harral challenged and defeated an ettin in single combat by hacking its legs from beneath its body with his axe. An axe of felling possesses the trip weapon feature and can be used to trip opponents up to two size categories larger than its wielder.
