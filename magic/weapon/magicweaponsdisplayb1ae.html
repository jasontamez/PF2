Description

The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This +1 short sword parts shadows in its wake, allowing its wielder to ignore the miss chance associated with concealment due to darkness or shadows, and to deal precision damage, such as sneak attack, against targets benefiting from concealment. This ability applies only on strikes made with this weapon, and does not affect the miss chance resulting from total concealment or any other source of concealment (such as the blur spell).
