Description

This +1 paper alchemical cartridge contains a bullet and is marked with a symbol of an ear. When fired from a firearm, a reporting cartridge allows the wielder to temporarily transfer her sense of hearing to the location where the bullet lands. Until she dismisses the effect by rubbing her ears as a move action, the wielder can hear as clairaudience from the square in which the bullet landed, regardless of whether it hit its mark.
