Description

Only ranged weapons can have the beaming ability. Once per day, as a swift action, a beaming weapon creates a number of glowing orbs equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus. The orbs float around the wielder's head like a halo and fire rays of light at the wielder's foes. Once per round when the wielder makes an attack or full-attack with the beaming weapon, the wielder can expend one orb as a free action to fire a beam of searing light at any target within range. The orbs remain until expended or until the wielder sleeps.
