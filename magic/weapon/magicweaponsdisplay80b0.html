Description

The blade of this +1 cutlass (Pirates of the Inner Sea 18) is spotted with rust, and its basket hilt is cast in the likeness of a grinning skull. Once per day, a tidewater cutlass can be used to cast hydraulic push.

Tidewater cutlasses are not uncommon weapons among the pirates of the Shackles, at least for those who can afford to buy one or who manage to loot one from someone who can. Mr. Plugg acquired his cutlass from a seasoned old tar aboard the Wormwood who had the temerity to point out the first mate's insecurities, and was beaten to death for his impudence. When more traditional discipline techniques prove ineffective, Mr. Plugg has been know to use his tidewater cutlass to "accidentally" push impertinent sailors overboard to drown in the Wormwood's wake.
