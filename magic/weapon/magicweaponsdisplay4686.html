Description

This +1 battle aspergillum has a dappled surface and a hollow interior, and it's made from a corrosion-resistant alloy that allows it to contain certain alchemical weapons. If the aspergillum is filled with one of these alchemical weapons, treat the contents as holy water, except that it deals the corresponding energy damage: acid (acid or alkali flask), cold (liquid ice), electricity (bottled lightning), fire (alchemist's fire), or sonic (burst jar). If the wielder is an alchemist, the aspergillum can function in this way an additional number of attacks equal to his Intelligence bonus before it needs to be refilled.
