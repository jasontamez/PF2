Description

This +1 arrow is crafted from human bone by agents of the Whispering Way. When it strikes a target, all mindless undead within 300 feet are compelled to attack the creature struck. This effect ignores the immunity to mind-affecting effects normally granted by the undead creature type. Undead under the control of another creature can be forced to ignore this command if their master succeeds at a DC 11 caster level check. Sentient undead are unaffected. The compulsion lasts for 1 minute, after which the undead revert to their normal behavior.
