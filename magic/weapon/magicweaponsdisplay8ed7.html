Description

This humble weapon appears to be little more than a crudely sharpened stake or makeshift spear, but in truth it is a far more formidable weapon. In addition to being a +2 undead bane spear, a heartswood spear deals bludgeoning damage when it is swung as a staff. When employed in such a manner, it also possesses the disruption property.
