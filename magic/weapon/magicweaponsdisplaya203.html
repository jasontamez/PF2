Description

This short, curved dagger shimmers with folded layers of iron and steel. It acts as a +1 undead-bane dagger. Once per day when the dagger of repose is used to perform a coup de grace to slay a living creature, the wielder can bless the victim's corpse, preventing the victim from rising as an undead because of ongoing diseases or curse effects. This protection also prevents the victim's corpse from being animated by necromancy magic such as animate dead or create undead for 24 hours.
