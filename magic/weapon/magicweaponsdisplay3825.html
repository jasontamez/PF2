Description

This ability can be placed only on melee weapons. An exhausting weapon can bring a great weariness to opponents in battle. On a critical hit, the wielder can choose to forgo the additional damage dice to instead sap the struck creature's strength and stamina, causing it to become exhausted. Opponents that are already exhausted don't suffer any additional effects, and creatures immune to the effects of exhaustion or to critical hits are not affected.
