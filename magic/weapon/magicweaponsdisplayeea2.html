Description

This well-balanced, two-handed cleaver is nearly 6 feet in length. Its blade protrudes from a hilt that appears to be the spine of an animal, capped with a skull at its end. A boneshaking cleaver functions as a +3 unholy greataxe. On a critical hit, it also rattles the target's bones, rending flesh and separating joints. This deals 1 point of Constitution damage and allows the wielder to apply one of the following conditions to the target for 1 round: deafened, shaken, or sickened.
