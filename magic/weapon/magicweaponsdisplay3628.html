Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons. The wielder can make attacks of opportunity with an interfering weapon as if he threatened all spaces within the weapon's first range increment or 30 feet, whichever is closer. However, the wielder cannot make multiple ranged attacks of opportunity with an interfering weapon against a creature that moves out of multiple threatened spaces within range using a single move action, even if the wielder has Combat Reflexes or other effects that allow multiple attacks of opportunity.
