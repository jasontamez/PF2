Description

This +1 returning atlatl dart is not destroyed when used as ammunition for an atlatl. Its returning special ability functions even if it is fired as ammunition. Like all atlatl darts, a tenacious atlatl dart can be thrown; if it is thrown, it is treated in all ways as a javelin. Two times per day, when the dart successfully strikes a foe who is benefiting from an abjuration spell or ability, the atlatl automatically attempts a dispel check against that effect, as dispel magic, before returning to the wielder as normal.
