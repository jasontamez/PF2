Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons or ammunition. A cyclonic weapon or piece of ammunition feels as though it were surrounded by gentle winds pulling it in all directions. When the wielder makes a ranged attack with a cyclonic weapon, a sheath of whirling air surrounds the weapon or the ammunition fired and prevents the attack from being impaired by wind, water, and other liquid or gaseous environmental factors.
