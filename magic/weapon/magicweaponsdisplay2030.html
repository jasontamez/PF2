Description

Bulbous fungal growths sprout from this short sword's blade, particularly around the hilt. The fungal growths constantly swell, wither, and sprout again in a continuous cycle. The growths appear bright blue, green, yellow, and purple. The weapon's blade is a dull gray that does not reflect light.

The sporeblade is a +2 keen short sword. On a successful critical hit, the sporeblade deals its normal critical damage and also creates a puff of mottled spores. The victim of the critical hit must make a DC 20 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and becomes fatigued for 1 hour as the spores take root in his flesh and grow with unsettling speed into thick, fibrous tendrils. The special critical hit ability of the sporeblade functions no more than once per round.
