Description

This pitch-black +1 flaming warhammer is bereft of any ornamentation beyond an engraving on its face of a bull's head with an open flame, the unholy symbol of the archdevil Moloch. Whenever the wielder of Sinderbos successfully strikes a creature with the hammer, he can create a cloud of ash around the target as an immediate action. This ash shares the target's space and persists for 1 round before dissipating. The ash does not obscure sight, but the target and any creatures that enter the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls for 1 round as they cough and choke on the fiery ash. Holding one's breath provides no benefit, but creatures that don't breathe or that have any kind of fire immunity or resistance are immune to the cloud's effects.

If Moloch is the wielder's patron, the wielder can forge masterwork armor and weapons with Sinderbos, which reduces the DC of the Craft check for items' masterwork components to 10 (the Craft DC for the items' standard components are unchanged). Items crafted in this way have a faint evil aura for the purposes of detect evil or similar effects.
