Description

This +1 vicious two-handed melee shadowcraft weapon has the texture and consistency of coagulated blood. A shadowy, chained skull always features prominently upon it regardless of what form a torment of the Midnight Lord assumes. Any creature suffering a bleed effect takes a penalty on Will saving throws to disbelieve the weapon's attacks equal to half the bleed damage the creature took on its last turn. In addition, all damage dealt to a foe by the vicious weapon special ability of a torment of the Midnight Lord in any illumination condition other than bright light doesn't heal naturally and resists magical healing. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by a torment of the Midnight Lord must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. Damage done to the wielder of a torment of the Midnight Lord does not have this effect, and can be healed normally.

A torment of the Midnight Lord can be used as an unholy symbol divine focus of Zon-Kuthon.
