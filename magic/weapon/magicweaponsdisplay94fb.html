Description

This special ability allows a weapon to find chinks in a foe's defenses using the wielder's knowledge of the target. Whenever the weapon's attack is a critical threat, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on the confirmation roll if she has 5 or more ranks in a Knowledge skill that would be used to identify the creature's type, or a +6 bonus instead if she has 15 or more ranks.
