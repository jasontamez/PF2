Description

This oversized +2 warhammer is forged
from blue steel and engraved with
Abyssal runes that read, -There are no
screams for those who die the frozen
death.- A frost-thunder hammer is sized
for giants; it is a two-handed weapon
for Medium-sized creatures, who take
a -2 penalty on attack rolls for wielding
an oversized weapon.

Once per day as a ranged touch attack, the wielder of a frost-thunder
hammer can slam the weapon against the ground to
release a crackling bolt of ice that shoots across the ground
toward a single target up to 100 feet away. On a successful
hit, the ice immediately freezes around the target, trapping it
within a 9-inch-thick solid block of pale blue ice. The ice blocks
line of effect to the entrapped victim, who is helpless (but can
still breathe) and takes 9 points of cold damage per round until
freed. The ice has hardness 0 and 27 hit points; if the ice is broken, the creature is freed. A creature can break the ice as
a full-round action with a successful DC 24 Strength check.
