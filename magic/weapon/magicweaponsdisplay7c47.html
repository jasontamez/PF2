Description

This +1 spiked gauntlet is shaped like a skull studded with metal spikes. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can strike the ground with the gauntlet, causing a 10-foot-square, 30-foot-deep extradimensional pit filled with spikes to open within 30 feet, as per spiked pit (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 246). The gauntlet's enhancement bonus is added to the piercing damage caused by the pit's spikes. If the wearer increases the gauntlet's enhancement bonus (such as with greater magic weapon or a paladin's divine bond ability), the additional weapon enhancement bonus is also added to the damage. Similarly, if the gauntlet has any weapon special abilities that deal extra damage (such as flaming or wounding), this extra damage is likewise added to the damage caused by the pit's spikes. Weapon special abilities that don't deal extra damage, or that deal damage to the wielder as well (such as vicious) do not affect the pit's spikes.
