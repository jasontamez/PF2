Description

Weapons with this special ability cause foes struck by them to have difficulty controlling their magic. Any time a creature that has been struck by a distracting weapon would have to succeed at a concentration check to complete a spell or use a special ability or item, the DC of that check increases by 5. This distraction lasts for 1 minute. Once a distracting weapon affects a creature in this way, that creature can't be affected by a distracting effect for 24 hours, though it can be affected by a greater distracting effect.
