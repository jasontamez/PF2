Description

The threads of this +1 ghost touch net are made of silver and magical force. The net has 15 hit points and can be burst with a successful DC 30 Strength check (a full-round action). The net can be used to entrap an incorporeal or gaseous creature, which can attempt a DC 20 Escape Artist check to get out. If a spirit creature possessing a body, such as a vetala, is trapped in the net, it cannot abandon its physical host unless it escapes or bursts the net.
