Description

Forged centuries ago for a master poisoner known for her seductive assassinations, Deadly Kiss is a Tian-style +1 dagger with a blue metal blade. If the wielder is carrying poison on her person, she can, as a swift action, magically apply the poison to the blade with no chance of exposing herself to the poison. The poison simply disappears from its container and reappears on the blade. This consumes the dose of poison. As with any poisoned weapon, if an attack with the blade results in a natural 1, the wielder exposes herself to the poison unless she has the poison use special ability.
