Description

Injecting weapons feature bulbous pommels and small grooves along their blades, allowing them to store and deliver poison. An injecting weapon can hold up to 3 doses of injury poison. As a swift action, the wielder of an injecting weapon can coat the weapon with 1 dose of one of the inserted poisons. Only bladed weapons can be made into injecting weapons. Adding a dose of poison to the reservoir is a full-round action.
