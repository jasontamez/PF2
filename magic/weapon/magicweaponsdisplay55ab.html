Description

This +1 flaming falchion is engraved with leering, long-tongued demonic faces. As a standard action, the bearer can will the weapon to transform into a +1 flaming kukri or back to its larger form. The weapon has an affinity for humanoid blood and remains slick and wet with it long after it would normally dry. If the wielder kills a humanoid with Redlust's Daughter, she can lick clean this blood as a move action to heal 1d4 hit points. Lamashtu's church also creates a similar weapon called Chillheart's Daughter, which is a +1 frost falchion that otherwise has the same properties as this weapon.
