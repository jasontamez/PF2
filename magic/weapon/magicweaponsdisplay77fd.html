Description

The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This bejeweled +1 keen rapier has gilt edges and appears to be merely ornamental. It bears an enchantment that is intended to ensure its bearer is never bested by sheer weight of numbers. As long as the wielder is threatening an opponent with the foil, other foes must succeed at a DC 12 Will save to move to a space where they would also be threatened by the foil; those who fail this save end their movement just outside the foil's reach.
