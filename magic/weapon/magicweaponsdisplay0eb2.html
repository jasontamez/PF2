Description

This +1/+1 quarterstaff is hollow, drilled through with numerous tiny holes, and whistles when swung and spun. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder may spin the hurricane quarterstaff and create a gust of wind (DC 13 Fortitude negates). A monk or ninja wielding a hurricane quarterstaff can also spend 1 ki point to activate the staff's gust of wind power; the save DC when activating this power with ki is equal to 12 + the wielder's Wisdom modifier.
