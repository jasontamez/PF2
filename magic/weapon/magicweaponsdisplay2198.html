Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons. A driving weapon can be used to perform bull rush and trip combat maneuvers in its first range increment. A successful ranged bull rush does not require the wielder to move to push the target farther than 5 feet. A ranged trip that fails by 10 or more cannot result in the attacker being knocked prone.
