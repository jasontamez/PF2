Description

This +2 lesser designating composite longbow (+3 Str) has a bowstring that resembles a thorny vine. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can prick her finger on the vine and fire an arrow at a creature or square to cause the arrow to become a wall of thorns centered on the struck creature or object. When the wielder is targeting a square, treat that as a ranged attack against AC 5. The wielder can choose how the wall of thorns is oriented.
