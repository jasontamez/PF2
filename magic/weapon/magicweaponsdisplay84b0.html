Description

This special ability can be placed only on slashing or piercing melee weapons. While the wielder benefits from a raging song performance (whether her own or from an ally), this weapon gains the keen weapon special ability. If the wearer confirms a critical hit while under the effects of a raging song, she gains 1d10 temporary hit points that last until they're reduced to 0 or the raging song ends, whichever comes first. If the weapon's critical multiplier is x3, add 2d10 temporary hit points instead; if the multiplier is x4, add 3d10 temporary hit points instead. While its powers are active, the weapon vibrates and makes a barely audible hum that rises to a shriek of triumph when it confirms a critical hit.
