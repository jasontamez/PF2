Description

This Large +1 tetsubo (see page 27) is banded in corroded iron bearing brass studs that are embossed with wicked Tien characters of punishment and pain. Once per day, the wielder can bestow a blood geas upon a willing subject who swears an oath to the wielder (the wielder and the subject must agree on the exact nature of the oath). The blood geas functions as a mark of justice that activates if the subject of the blood geas breaks his oath, dealing 12d6+9 points of damage to the subject. If the subject survives, the blood geas is removed, though the subject can swear a new oath and receive a new blood geas if he chooses. A character can be under only one blood geas at a time. A blood geas is permanent unless removed by the wielder.
