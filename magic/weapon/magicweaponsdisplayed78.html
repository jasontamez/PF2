Description

As servants of the rightful ruler of Osirion, the Ruby Prince Khemet III, members of the organization known as the Risen G uard often wield these specially ordained blades. Each +2 flaming khopesh was crafted by one of the predominant Osirian churches, such as the church of Abadar, Nethys, or Pharasma.

Anytime its wielder is healed by channeled positive energy, a risen blade gains a charge. Whenever the wielder confirms a critical hit, she can release the stored energy in the blade as a free action. The wielder channels positive energy (as the class feature) and must choose to damage undead or heal the living. This action expends all the blade's charges. Each charge is worth 1d6 points of damage or healing, and for each charge spent, the wielder can choose to exclude one creature in the area from being affected. The DC to save against this positive energy is equal to 15 + 1 per stored charge expended. A risen blade can't gain a charge from healing caused by the release of charges from itself or another risen blade.

A risen blade can store up to 5 charges. Each charge dissipates if not used within 24 hours.
