Description

It is said that the empyreal lord Ragathiel's divine soldiers
wield these golden +1 holy greatswords in their battles against
fiends and other evil creatures. Once per day upon successfully
striking an evil-aligned creature with a sword of vengeance,
the wielder can cause the sword to emit a 20-foot-radius burst
of holy energy. This effect is identical to that of a holy smite
spell centered on the creature struck, and deals 4d8 points
of damage to each evil creature in the area (or 9d6 points of
damage to evil outsiders) and causes each to become blinded
for 1 round. A successful DC 16 Will save halves the damage and
negates the blinded effect. Neutral creatures in the area only
take half damage (reduced to one-quarter on a successful save)
and are not blinded.
