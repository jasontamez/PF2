Description

A weapon with the guided property allows its wielder to use his instinct when striking blows with it. Attacks from a guided weapon generally don't strike hard, but they strike at precisely the right moment to maximize damage if in the hands of a particularly wise wielder. A character who attacks with a guided weapon modifies his attack rolls and weapon damage rolls with his Wisdom modifier, not his Strength modifier. This modifier to damage is not adjusted for two-handed weapons or off-hand weapons-it always remains equal to the wielder's Wisdom modifier. A guided weapon may be wielded as a normal weapon, using Strength to modify attack and damage rolls, but this goes against the weapon's nature and imparts a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made in this manner.
