Description

This special ability can be placed only on piercing or slashing melee weapons. The first time each round that the wielder hits a living target with a vampiric weapon, the weapon restores an amount of hit points to the wielder equal to 1/2 the damage dealt to the target, to a maximum equal to the wielder's number of Hit Dice. If the damage was more than enough to kill the target, any excess damage doesn't count toward the amount healed. A creature can regain no more than 2 hit points per Hit Die from a vampiric weapon each day. A new owner gains no healing from a vampiric weapon until she owns it for 24 consecutive hours, and a wielder can be attuned to only one vampiric or greater vampiric weapon at a time. Finally, a wielder healed by a vampiric weapon can't exceed her maximum hit point total, though excess healing also doesn't count toward the daily limit of hit points she can regain.

Both living and undead creatures can benefit from the healing. A vampiric weapon automatically converts the stolen energy into positive or negative energy, as appropriate for the wielder.
