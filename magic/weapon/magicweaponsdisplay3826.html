Description

Most often appearing as a simple flattened board inscribed with a portion of Cayden Cailean's holy text, a censuring placard is used to inflict just punishment on offenders of church guidelines or to knock allies roughly back to their senses. A censuring placard functions as a +1 club. As a swift action with a successful melee attack, the wielder can use the placard to cast break enchantment on that target. Whether this effort is successful or not, the break enchantment ability cannot be used again for a week.
