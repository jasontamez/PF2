Description

This special ability can be placed only on melee weapons. When the wielder issues the command word, a shrinking weapon shrinks to the size of a standard dagger. While in this state, the weapon deals 1d4 points of damage but is more easily concealable. When the command word is spoken again, the weapon returns to its original state.
