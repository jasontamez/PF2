Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons. If the wielder spends at least 1 minute preparing a hiding place or when she uses the sniping rules (Core Rulebook 106), she adds the weapon's enhancement bonus as a competence bonus on Stealth checks. An ambushing weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of damage on a successful hit during a surprise round or against a creature that is unaware of the wielder's presence. This extra damage is precision damage; it is not multiplied on a critical hit but does stack with other forms of precision damage.
