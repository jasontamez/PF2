Description

The spirit caller is a +1 ghost touch mere club carved of nephrite jade. Incorporeal undead and ghosts struck by the spirit caller must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be drawn inside the mere and are trapped within it. When holding a spirit inside, the spirit caller glows from within with the brightness of a candle and functions as a +2 ghost touch undead bane mere club. The mere consumes the energy of the spirit inside in 1 hour, destroying it, and can hold but a single spirit at a time. The wielder can release a trapped spirit as a standard action. Ghosts consumed by a spirit caller still rejuvenate as normal.
