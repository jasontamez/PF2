Description

This bright +1 starknife is engraved with a beautiful moth icon. When wielded, it leaves a trail of harmless starry motes that shed light as a candle in any squares the wielder occupies or moves through. These motes last for 1 round before fading away. Once per day, the wielder can speak a command word to use jump (with a +20 bonus), but this effect immediately ends if the wielder loses its grasp on the weapon. Additionally, once per day the wielder can use it to fire a blast of motes, with the same effect as color spray.
