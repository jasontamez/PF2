Description

This +3 earth breaker is blocky and heavy. Several chrysoberyls adorn the head around its striking surface. The density hammer's wielder is immune to petrification effects, but each time the wielder would be subject to a petrification effect, the density hammer's weight doubles and its enhancement bonus decreases by 1 for 24 hours. If the density hammer's enhancement bonus decreases to 0, the wielder is no longer immune to petrification effects and the density hammer gains the fragile weapon special feature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22).
