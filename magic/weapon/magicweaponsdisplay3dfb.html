Description

The cross-guard and tines of this +2 adamantine sai are crafted of a mysterious red metal, adorned with grinning skulls. The haft is wrapped with delicate white crane feathers. Only a handful of tsuruhashi are known to exist, each one crafted as a silent killer. The weapon grants a +1 bonus to the DC of Fortitude saves made against an assassin's death attack or ninja's assassinate ability. In addition, while executing such an attack, the wielder of a tsuruhashi may cast silence upon his victim as a swift action. This ability can be used once per day and affects only the victim of the attack.
