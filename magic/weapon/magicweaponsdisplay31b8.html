Description

This punching dagger's blade is engraved with images of spider webs. Upon close inspection, the images seem to come alive as if spiders were swarming across the webs on the blade. Twice per day as a free action, this +2 keen wounding punching dagger can poison a living creature hit by an attack made by this weapon as the poison spell (Fortitude DC 20 negates). In addition, the wielder gains a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move through an enemy's threatened area without provoking an attack of opportunity.
