Description

The Codex is enormous-supposedly, it requires two strong
men to lift it. No matter how many pages are turned, another
always remains. Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is
utterly annihilated, as with a destruction spell (Fortitude DC 30).
Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers,
though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex
allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn
one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a
+1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent
reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study
also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of
study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The
powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral
projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar
ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind. Each of
these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the
Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the
power). The Codex of the Infinite Planes has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all
saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power
requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the
power; the character can’t take 10 on this check). Any failure
on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user
(roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur
only one catastrophe per power use.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>d%</td><td>Catastrophe</td></tr>
<tr><td>01–25</td><td>Natural Fury: An earthquake spell centered on the
reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an
intensified storm of vengeance spell is centered
and targeted on the reader.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26–50</td><td>Fiendish Vengeance: A gate opens and 1d3+1 balors,
pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders step through and
attempt to destroy the owner of the Codex.</td></tr>
<tr><td>51–75</td><td>Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader’s soul is captured
(as trap the soul; no save allowed) in a random
gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body
is entombed beneath the earth (as imprisonment).</td></tr>
<tr><td>76–100</td><td>Death: The reader utters a wail of the banshee and
then is subject to a destruction spell. This repeats
every round for 10 rounds until the reader is dead.</td></tr></table>

Destruction

The Codex of the Infinite Planes is destroyed if one page is torn
out and left on each plane in existence. Note that tearing out a
page immediately triggers a catastrophe.
