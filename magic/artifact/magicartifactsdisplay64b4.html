Description

Furcas's weapon is a +4 axiomatic flaming burst unholy trident. The weapon's flaming burst special ability wreathes the trident in hellfire-half the damage its flames deal is fire damage, while the other half results directly from infernal power and is therefore not reduced by fire resistance. As a standard action, Furcas can slam the trident's haft against the ground, causing all creatures within 30 feet to be affected by dimensional anchor. Any affected creature that attempts to teleport or travel to another plane (even by a permanent gate) instead appears in a square adjacent to Furcas. As a standard action, Furcas can call the trident to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries.

Destruction

The Avernus Claw must be sunk to the bottom of the deepest sea of Elysium for 1 year, then dealt a blow by the weapon of a chaotic good deity.
