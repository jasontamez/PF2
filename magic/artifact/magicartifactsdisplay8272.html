Description

This dimension-hopping artifact waits
patiently until a creature picks it up.
Each time it is picked up by a new user,
the monkey's paw grants that creature
three wishes, as if it were a ring of three
wishes. Once a new user picks up the
monkey's paw, it cannot be discarded,
not even by way of a wish or a miracle spell. Even if stolen, it
reappears among the user's possessions within 1d4 hours. It can only be parted from its bearer when all three of its wishes
are used or it is destroyed-but such a feat takes time and
patience. When a bearer uses a wish granted by the monkey's
paw, he is then subject to a curse, as per the spell major curse
(DC 25 to remove; Ultimate Magic 215). This curse manifests as
the creature taking a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability
checks, and skill checks until the curse is removed. These
penalties are cumulative in cases where multiple wishes are
used before past curses are removed. Once all three wishes
are used, the monkey paw plane shifts to a random plane and
begins the process anew.

Destruction

The monkey's paw is destroyed when its user retains the artifact
and is cursed by it for 1,000 years.
