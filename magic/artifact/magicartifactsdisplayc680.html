Description

This 2-foot-tall marble statue has the exact appearance of a mortal creature, constantly reflecting any changes to its appearance from injury, age, or even reincarnation. The creature represented may be identified only if you are already familiar with the creature, and until activated, the creature exhibits no evidence of its connection to the mindbind figurine.

An unsculpted mindbind figurine appears as a featureless humanoid, but can be linked to a creature in a complex demonic ritual overseen by a chosen acolyte of the demon lord Nocticula, at which point the statue takes on the form of the creature and is bound inexorably to the creature's mind while awaiting its activation.

When broken, a mindbind figurine triggers a delayed dominate monster effect in the mind of the sculpted creature, causing it to play its designated role in Nocticula's sinister plans. The creature gets no save against this effect, as the save is made at the time of the figurine's creation.

Destruction

A mindbind figurine can only be destroyed by physical damage. Destroying one in such a manner activates the linked creature.
