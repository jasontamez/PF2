Description

The Shard of Greed is made of black adamantine. As long as the Shard of Greed is carried, its owner can use haste as a spell-like ability once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus transmutation spells, and gains a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls.

Curse: The owner becomes greedy, and is sickened whenever she is not wearing at least 500 gp per Hit Die in nonmagical jewelry and fine clothing. Each time the owner sells a belonging or gives one away, she must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.

Destruction

A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can one destroy the shards.
