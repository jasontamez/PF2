Description

Three faces representing the threefold
aspect of womanhood-maiden, mother,
and crone-adorn this solid silver ring.
Baba Yaga crafted the Artrosa Ring for
her chosen warden of the sacred site
of Artrosa, and it functions as a ring of
protection +2 and a ring of regeneration.

Within 15 miles of Artrosa’s towering figures, the Artrosa Ring
also grants its wearer the following abilities.

Quicksilver: The wearer can teleport to any location inside
Artrosa’s dungeons or within a 15-mile radius of Artrosa. Any
location in this area is considered "very familiar."

Seer: By concentrating for 10 minutes, the wearer can see
and hear everything that transpires in a single chamber inside
Artrosa, as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance.

Shroud: Three times per day, the wearer can alter the
appearance of a single room within one of Artrosa’s dungeons,
as well as the appearance of any creatures inside the room, as
with mirage arcana and veil. The wearer must be present in the
room to use this ability, and the illusions fade as soon as the
wearer leaves the room.

Threefold Aspect: Whenever the wearer enters one of
Artrosa’s dungeons, her age and appearance shift to match
that of the corresponding dungeon (maiden, mother, or
crone) as if affected by the threefold aspect spell. If the
wearer moves to a different dungeon, her age and appearance
change accordingly. The wearer doesn’t gain additional skill
ranks, and a spellcaster doesn’t gain any additional bonus
spells for her increased ability scores, but the save DCs for
her spells do increase. Outside these dungeons, the wearer
returns to her natural age and appearance. The wearer has
no control over this ability-it automatically takes effect
whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa’s dungeons.

Vision: If the wearer is a witch of at least 10th level, she
gains access to the vision major hex and can use it as if she
had it as a normal class feature.

Outside of Artrosa, the Artrosa Ring loses all of the above
abilities except its function as a ring of protection +2 and a ring
of regeneration. In addition, the wearer can use the ring to
cast threefold aspect once per day.

Destruction

The Artrosa Ring must be bathed in the light of Golarion’s moon
for 3 separate nights-once during the waxing moon, once
during the full moon, and once during the waning moon. If the
ring is then struck with Kostchtchie’s adamantine warhammer
in the Eon Pit in Artrosa on the night of the new moon, the
Artrosa Ring is destroyed.
