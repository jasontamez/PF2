Description

This armor looks like a more massive
and dangerous suit of demon armor.
It is a suit of +5 heavy fortification full
plate that allows its wearer to make
claw attacks that deal 2d10 points of
damage, and strike as +3 weapons
that are treated as chaotic and evil for
the purposes of overcoming damage
reduction. Additionally, those struck
by the claws must succeed at a DC 20
Fortitude save or be affected as per the spell contagion. The
armor's claws are built into the armor so these weapons cannot
be disarmed. While wearing the armor, the wearer benefits
from the following demonic traits.
<ul><li>The wearer gains darkvision 60 ft. If it already has darkvision,
the range of its darkvision is increased by 60 ft.
</li><li>The wearer does not need to breathe or eat.
</li><li>The wearer is immune to electricity and poison.
</li><li>The wearer gains resistance to acid 10, cold 10 and fire 10.
</li><li>The wearer gains telepathy and speaks Abyssal, Celestial,
and Draconic.</li></ul>

Destruction

The Demon Prince Armor dissolves if submerged in the tears of a demon lord. If that foul concoction is then drank by an angel, the armor is destroyed.
