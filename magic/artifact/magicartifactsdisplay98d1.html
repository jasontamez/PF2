Description

This verdant branch glows with a soothing, pale green light.
Carefully pruned from the world's first tree, this artifact hums
with energy. Full of everlasting life, it needs time to transfer
its magic. It can cast heal at will, but needs a full hour to do
so. Once a day, it can cast resurrection, but it takes the full day
to do so.

The branch serves only those who are worthy. It will not stay
in the possession of a non-good creature for long, disappearing
in 1d4 days. It will similarly disappear while in the possession
of a good creature who associates with nongood creatures, but
this takes 2d8 days to occur.

Destruction

The branch of life can be destroyed by taking it to the heart of the Negative Energy Plane.
