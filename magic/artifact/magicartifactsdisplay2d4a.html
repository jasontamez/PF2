Description

This still-warm heart drips trickles of golden blood. Torn from the chest of the Herald of Iomedae, the Heart of the Herald has been corrupted with evil. Any lawful or good character who carries the heart gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the heart is carried, even if it's carried in an extradimensional space. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they can't be overcome in any way so long as the heart is carried, with one exception: a worshiper of Iomedae can cast atonement on the heart to suppress this effect for 24 hours.

Once per day, by squeezing the heart in the hand as a standard action, the user can cause all good outsiders within 60 feet to take 1 point of Constitution bleed. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this effect. At the start of each round, a target may attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save to end the effect.

As long as it its carried, the Heart of the Herald grants SR 25 against all spells cast by worshipers of Iomedae and a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against such spells.

Destruction

The Heart of the Herald must be used to redeem the Herald of the Ivory Labyrinth (see page 52).
