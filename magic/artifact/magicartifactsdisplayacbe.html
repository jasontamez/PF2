Description

The anima focus is an immense artifact created by Karzoug in the final years of Thassilon, based upon the research and notes of the Lords of Greed in Runeforge. This artifact maintains the link between the Material Plane and the Eye of Avarice, and siphons fragments of greedy souls that have been prepared by a special ritual through the soul lens found within the Eye of Avarice into the runewell itself. The anima focus has other powers as well, linked to the Pinnacle of Avarice'see page 359 for details.

Destruction

The soul lens to which the anima focus is linked must be destroyed, after which the anima focus can be destroyed by physical damage or magic (hardness 20; hp 800; Break DC 50).
