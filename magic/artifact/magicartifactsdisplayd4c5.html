Description

Each Godclaw gauntlet is a +2 axiomatic spiked gauntlet. Once per day, the left Godclaw gauntlet can be used to cast a quickened order's wrath spell, while the right Godclaw gauntlet can be used to cast a quickened dismissal spell.

If a character wears both Godclaw gauntlets, he gains the benefit of Two-Weapon Fighting while attacking with the gauntlets (but not with other weapons he might wield). In addition, once per day, the wearer can request the aid of one of five deities and cast a specific spell, as detailed below. Note that calling upon the aid of a deity of a different alignment than your own or the aid of a deity other than the one you worship (if you are a divine spellcaster who worships a specific deity) may have alignment- or class-based repercussions.

Abadar: The wearer gains the benefit of discern lies.
Asmodeus: The wearer creates a wall of fire.
Iomedae: The wearer gains the benefit of divine power.
Irori: The wearer gains the benefit of freedom of movement.
Torag: The wearer gains the benefit of stoneskin.

Destruction

A Godclaw gauntlet must be brought to the Worldwound or the Abyss by a Hellknight of the Godclaw, who must then allow a demon of at least CR 15 or higher to bite off and consume both gauntlet and hand alike.
