Description

This shepherd's crook is formed of alternating bands of ivory and obsidian around a sycamore shaft. Golden runes run the length of the staff, twisting into new configurations as its various powers are used. The staff of the scholar has all the powers of a regular staff of the magi plus the following abilities: contact other plane (2 charges), legend lore (2 charges), and scrying (2 charges). If the wielder of the staff of the scholar uses its retributive strike ability and successfully travels to another plane of existence, he always arrives in the abode of a god of knowledge (though not necessarily a friendly one).

Destruction

This item can be destroyed in the same manner as a normal staff of the magi.
