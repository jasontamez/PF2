Description

The Vernal Key consists of three lattice orbs, one inside the other, all carved from a single piece of blue mineral. The key was created to unlock a jarl's prison, but as a side effect it also protects the region around it from the ravages of winter.

Within a 5-mile radius of the Vernal Key, otherwise cold weather (below 40 F) becomes moderate, while severe cold (below 0 F) becomes only cold. A mild wind demarcates the edge of this effect. The key must remain stationary (unattended) to produce this effect; it takes 24 hours for the artifact to attune itself to its locale. The key only ameliorates natural weather; it has no effect on magically created effects or extraplanar environments.

Destruction

The power of the Vernal Key is intrinsically tied to the Elemental Plane of Air, where it was created. It can only be destroyed by returning it to that plane and then using a rod of cancellation on it.
