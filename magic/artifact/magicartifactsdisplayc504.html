Description

The Impossible Eye grants a number of potent powers of divination. In order to activate any of these powers, the user must look into the mirror and make a DC 20 Will save; failure indicates that the user becomes fascinated by his reflection until an outside force breaks his gaze. Left alone, a fascinated viewer doesn't eat, drink, move, or sleep, and eventually dies of thirst. If the Will save is successful, the viewer can activate any of the mirror's powers as a standard action.

5/day: vision
3/day: greater prying eyes, greater scrying
1/day: contact other plane, discern location, foresight

The Impossible Eye can also be used to read any nonmagical language-any written message reflected in the mirror appears in unmirrored text written in the holder's native tongue. The mirror can be used to safely peruse the text of the Codex of Infinite Planes in this manner.

Destruction

The Impossible Eye was crafted in a secret foundry somewhere in the Plane of Fire-it may only be destroyed by returning it to this foundry and smashing it against the oven in which its glass was created.
