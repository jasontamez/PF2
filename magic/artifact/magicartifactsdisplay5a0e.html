Description

Anyone who reads the entire hundred pages of blood-scripted text bound within the Bone Grimoire (a task that requires 1 week of study and a successful DC 25 Linguistics check by someone who can read Thassilonian) gains a +2 inherent bonus to Intelligence as well as a permanent +4 insight bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft checks associated with necromancy. In addition, the pages contain information identical to that contained in a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay98c1.html?FinalName=Golem%20ManualFlesh">flesh golem manual</a>-these pages restore themselves and can be used once per year.

A character who reads the Bone Grimoire becomes somewhat separated from the living. His flesh takes on a pallid cast, and he is now affected by positive and negative energy as if he were undead. If the reader previously had the ability to channel positive energy, he now channels negative energy. A miracle or wish can remove the effects of the Bone Grimoire, both beneficial and otherwise.

Destruction

If the Bone Grimoire is subjected to the runewaking ritual, it is destroyed.
