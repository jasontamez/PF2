Description

The so-called Invidious Halberd was intended to epitomize a sort of balance to the other six Alara-quin-Emperor Xin sought to infuse this weapon with potent abilities to negate powerful works of magic and saw its bearer as a potential champion of the regulation of power. Yet when the first to carry the weapon, Runelord Naaft, fell to the same corruption and sin that consumed the other six runelords, Xin soon realized the naive folly of his hopes. Over the years, as the weapon passed from one runelord's hands to the next's, the Invidious Halberd's self-loathing and hatred of arcane spellcasters only grew. It only grudgingly abided its runelord wielders, accepting them as its proper bearers but never fully appreciating their skills. The halberd itself is truly happy only when it is used to cut down those who can cast arcane spells-particularly if such targets are wizards. Its knack for consuming magic and leaving magic-wielding foes baffled and befuddled quickly earned its users an additional level of scorn and perhaps a sliver of fear of the halberd itself. Of course, for the Runelords of Envy, this only heightened their feelings of jealousy.

When Belimarius's Invidious Halberd strikes a creature capable of casting arcane spells, the creature struck must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or the halberd drains one spell of 3rd level or less, storing that spell in its spell-storing ability (or if the drained spell is <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>, in its dispelling burst ability). The halberd picks which spell is stored, but otherwise this ability functions as if the creature struck had used the weapon's spell-storing ability to store a spell of the halberd's choice, losing that preparation of the spell (or a spell slot associated with it) in the process. It cannot use this ability if it already has a spell stored. On a critical hit against an arcane spellcaster, Belimarius's Invidious Halberd also casts <a href="spelldisplay9665.html?ItemName=">feeblemind</a> (DC 17) on the creature struck after it drains a spell.

Destruction

Belimarius's Invidious Halberd is destroyed if it is hurled under the crushing feet of the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, but only if there is no current Runelord of Envy living in the world.
