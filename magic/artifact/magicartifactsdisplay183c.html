Description

This elegantly wrought +3 speed longsword remains pristine despite having been sheathed in a submerged corpse's chest cavity for over 200 years. Given to Bartolomae by an agent of Asmodeus in return for the warlord's (initially) secret allegiance to the arch fiend, this weapon carries within it the cruel soul of a long-dead high priest of Asmodeus. The weapon begins in a state of dormancy, at which point all of its intelligent weapon powers are unavailable, and it functions as nothing more than a +3 speed longsword. See the description of area L4 for details on how the sword can be awakened.

Destruction

To destroy the weapon, you must immerse it in a bath of Asmodeus's tears.
