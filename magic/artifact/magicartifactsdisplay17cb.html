Description

This innocuous-looking scrap is nothing less than the physical manifestation of a man-made demiplane known as Kakishon, and the rune covering the scroll is in fact a representation of the plane's several island regions. To open the gate, one must unfurl the scroll and speak the names Aliskiren, Isles of Night, Ismaizade, Kakishon, Khandelwal, Khosravi, and Serpent Isles, each time touching the section of the rune corresponding to the named island group. Once, this process allowed the user to choose where to appear within the realm, but the scroll is now damaged, and upon activation, all creatures within 50 feet with line of effect to the scroll must make a DC 40 Reflex save. Those who fail are sucked into the scroll and bodily transported to one of the waypoints within the demiplane of Kakishon (see map). At the same instant creatures enter the plane, any being that previously entered the plane involuntarily may choose to depart, being expelled from the scroll back to the Material Plane. Once inside Kakishon, escape can prove difficult, requiring those trapped within to wait for others to enter, for the casting of a spell similar to plane shift, or for the discovery of one of the foundations of Kakishon's reality, all of which transport the subjects back to the Material Plane to a point within 10 feet of the Scroll of Kakishon.

Destruction

Containing even a small group of chaotic beings such as azatas, proteans, or demons will gradually cause Kakishon to unravel, while a larger group or a more powerful chaotic entity can rend the demiplane to shreds in moments.
