Description

Whether they were invented by the Azlanti or merely discovered by them, ioun stones were an important part of Azlanti society-and by extension, of Thassilonian society. Many of Thassilon's rulers' particularly runelords like Karzoug-took to the art of embedding these stones in their flesh. An ioun stone implanted in this manner cannot be sundered or stolen. Further rules on implanting ioun stones can be found in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Seekers of Secrets.

Thassilonian wizards perfected and enhanced many forms of ioun stones, such as the four unusually powerful stones listed below. These stones are minor artifacts, and methods of their creation have been lost since Thassilon's fall.

Amber Spindle: An amber spindle grants a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws (the bonuses from possessing multiple amber spindles stack, up to a maximum of +5).
Crimson Sphere: This ioun stone grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence (the bonuses from possessing multiple crimson spheres stack, up to a maximum of +6).
Emerald Ellipsoid: An emerald ellipsoid grants 5 bonus hit points (the bonuses from multiple emerald ellipsoids stack; there is no maximum benefit).
Onyx Rhomboid: This stone grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution (the bonuses from possessing multiple onyx rhomboids stack, up to a maximum of +6).
