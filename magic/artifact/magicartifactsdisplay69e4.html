Description

In addition to serving as a vessel for Auberon's soul, the jaundiced skull ioun stone is a potent artifact with two protections against detection. First, when active, the <a href="magicwondrous8768.html?FinalSlot=Ioun">ioun stone</a> is invisible as it orbits the bearer's head. Secondly, the jaundiced skull ioun stone is immune to divination effects.

If a <a href="monsterdisplay37f3.html?ItemName=Lich">lich</a> activates this ioun stone, it can use its paralyzing touch as a ranged touch attack to a distance of 60 feet. In addition, if the lich whose soul is stored within the jaundiced skull ioun stone is slain and someone else takes possession of the artifact, the rate at which the lich rejuvenates is accelerated, as the ioun stone begins sapping the life force from its current bearer. The stone's bearer quickly rots, taking 1 point of Constitution drain initially and every hour thereafter while it is activated unless the bearer succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save. The creature bearing the ioun stone receives a new saving throw each time it would be subjected to Constitution drain. As long as the ioun stone has dealt at least 1 point of Constitution drain, the deterioration assists in the reformation of the lich's body, reducing the time required for rejuvenation to 1d10 hours instead of the normal 1d10 days.

Destruction

The jaundiced skull ioun stone can be destroyed only after the destruction of the lich whose soul it holds and before the lich has rejuvenated. During this time, the ioun stone must be subjected to a <a href="spelldisplay5b97.html?ItemName=consecrate">consecrate</a> spell and then be smashed to pieces. The jaundiced skull ioun stone has AC 26, 50 hit points, and hardness 10.
