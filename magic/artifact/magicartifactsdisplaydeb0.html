Description

This sphere acts as a normal sphere of annihilation in all respects, save that any use of a gate spell to destroy it results in an automatic planar rift to a plane of the GM's choosing. The sphere remains behind at its original location, intact and unaffected.

Destruction

A rift-born sphere can only be destroyed by using a rod of cancellation or fusion with another, normal sphere (which destroys both spheres in a 180-foot blast dealing 5d6 x 10 points of damage).
