Description

Rumored to have once been a single, normal sphere split in two through a failed attempt to destroy it, these dual spheres of annihilation are linked, such that objects devoured by one may be disgorged from the other. Anything devoured by one of the twin spheres must make a Fortitude save (DC 25) or be utterly consumed as by a normal sphere; anything that makes the save take 10d6 points of damage in transit and is hurled, smoking and partially disintegrated, from the maw of the other sphere. Anyone currently in mental control of one sphere may freely pass through it to the location of its twin.

Destruction

The twin spheres can be destroyed by directing one sphere through the other, causing an explosion that deals 20d6 damage to everything within 100 feet.
