Description

Each of these fabled Orbs contains the essence and personality
of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of
the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The
bearer of an Orb can, as a standard action, dominate a dragon
of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster),
the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist.
Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each Orb of
Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw
bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever
values the character would otherwise have, whether they are
better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means
short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing
an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon-but
only the breath weapon-of the dragon variety keyed to the
Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the
breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day.

All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate
verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs.
The owner of an Orb knows if there are dragons within 10
miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety,
the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the
Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact
location and age. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns
the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic
enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each Orb also
has an individual power that can be invoked once per round
at caster level 10th.

Destruction

An Orb of Dragonkind immediately shatters if it is caught in the breath weapon of a dragon who is a blood relative of the dragon trapped within. This causes everyone within 90 feet to be struck by the breath weapon of that dragon, released as the orb explodes.
