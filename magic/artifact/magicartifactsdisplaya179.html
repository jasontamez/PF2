Description

Carved long ago from the ice at the heart of an ancient glacier and infused with a cold and unstoppable drive, this +5 icy burst quenching bastard sword (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 146) changes size to match its wielder. Spell-like abilities used by Winter's Heart receive the benefits of Greater Spell Focus (evocation).

As a standard action, the wielder of Winter's Heart can dispel fire effects as a frost brand. Alternatively, as a standard action, the wielder can quench a Huge or smaller nonmagical fire by touching it with the sword.

The sword commands the following spell-like abilities:
3/day-heroism (on its wielder only)
1/day-empowered cone of cold (DC 21), maximized widened detonate (cold only, DC 20), word of recall

The DC for detonate is determined as if it were an 8th-level spell. If detonate is cast on a creature with the cold subtype, it also acts as heal; if cast on a creature with the fire subtype, it also acts as harm.

Winter's Heart has the special purpose of uniting the lands of the north under one iron rule. When pursuing this purpose, it surrounds its wielder in icy armor that combines the protection of stoneskin and fire shield (cold flames). If the protection of the stoneskin is exhausted, both protections are lost and the sword can't reestablish them for 10 minutes.

Destruction

Winter's Heart can be destroyed only if it's hurled into the center of a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Even a normal volcano's heat is insufficient to melt the blade, and Immersing it in magma merely solidifies the magma into rock.
