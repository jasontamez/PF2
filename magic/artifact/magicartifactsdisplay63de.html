Description

Alaznist's runewell of wrath is located within the Eye of Fury, a demiplane hidden within the uppermost reaches of the runelord's realm of Hollow Mountain. The runewell's job of absorbing fragments of wrath from souls has already finished and allowed Alaznist to emerge, but it retains a few additional powers of note, beyond providing a portal between the Eye of Fury and Alaznist's Demesne. It grants Alaznist the ability to cast <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a> at will, although its range is limited to Hollow Mountain and the surrounding environs of Rivenrake Island. It also allows Alaznist to grant immunity to fire to anyone she chooses; this immunity is permanent until she revokes it, but it functions only while a creature is in the Eye of Fury. The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep; the fiery liquid it contains functions as magma for the purposes of objects or creatures placed within it. Alaznist can extract up to 50,000 gp worth of material components (usually gemstones for casting spells like <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> or <a href="spelldisplay92c4.html?ItemName=forcecage">forcecage</a>) per day from this liquid fire; these material components fade if not used in 24 hours.

Destruction

The <a href="spelldisplayfe7c.html?ItemName=runewell%20of%20wrath">runewell of wrath</a> is linked to Alaznist, and as long as she lives, the runewell cannot be destroyed. If Alaznist is slain, the liquid fire within the runewell immediately cools and becomes ordinary water, destroying the runewell in the process (although it can still be used as a portal to travel to Alaznist's Demesne, provided the <a href="magicartifactsdisplayacbe.html?ItemName=Anima%20Focus">anima focus</a> at area E10 still functions).
