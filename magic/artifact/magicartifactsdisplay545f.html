Description

A purely cosmetic magical effect causes the elegant blade of this sword to cycle through distinctive colors and textures, making it appear to be crafted from massive pieces of gemstone, coral, or precious metals. Tannaris is a +5 <a href="magicwondrousdisplayfaa2.html?FinalName=Defending">defending</a> bastard sword. When used to augment the wielder's Armor Class, the sword's enhancement bonus continues to augment attacks and damage. Additionally, whenever Tannaris hits a creature under the effects of a spell, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or have the highest-level spell currently affecting it instantly dispelled (as if by the spell <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>; no additional dispel check is required). This ability has no special effect on summoned creatures or persistent spell effects. If the attack is a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or have all of the spells currently affecting it dispelled (as per the spell <a href="spelldisplay2b91.html?ItemName=greater%20dispel%20magic">greater dispel magic</a>; no additional dispel checks are required).

Destruction

If Runelord Belimarius issues a command as a standard action, Tannaris is destroyed.
