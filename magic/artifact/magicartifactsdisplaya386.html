Description

Great horns of gold, a massive sea serpent's skull, and the wings of Kazavon form the ornate Throne of Nalt. The throne grants whoever is seated upon it a +6 enhancement bonus to Charisma and Wisdom. Once per day, the user can cast geas/quest. Any creature with the evil subtype takes a -6 penalty on saving throws to resist this effect.

Destruction

The Throne of Nalt crumbles to dust if a person who wants nothing sits upon it and bequeaths all he has to another.
