Description

The beacon of true faith takes the form of an ornate torch
made of electrum. It holds an undying magical flame that
requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures
it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a
divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or
a creature of strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually
requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon
gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. For
example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful
and good powers, but a neutral cleric gains access to no
powers. All of these are command-word activated.

Chaotic (violet flame): Word of chaos once per day on
command.

Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain
the benefits of protection from evil and heroism.

Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of
protection from good and may use harm twice per day.

Lawful (golden flame): Dictum once per day on command.

Destruction

The beacon of true faith is destroyed if its bearer turns against the worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite alignment.
