Description

The handle of this simple straw broom,
or besom, is capped with a small skull
with long white hair. On command, the
broom sweeps away any tracks or traces
of passage, as pass without trace, and
wards its user with nondetection. The
broom can be used in this capacity for
a total of 8 hours each day. By sweeping
the broom in a circular motion, the user can also learn the
location of both secret doors and simple natural traps at will, as
detect secret doors and detect snares and pits.

Baba Yaga’s besom can also be used up to three times per
day to open locks, doors, lids, shackles, chains, and the like by
knocking it against the item to be opened. The wielder must
succeed at a caster level check using the broom’s caster level
of 20th, with a DC equal to the Disable Device DC of the lock
or binding. Each knock opens only one form of locking, so if a
chest is chained, locked, and under an arcane lock, it takes all
three uses of the broom to open it. The broom automatically
dispels a hold portal spell or arcane lock with a caster level
lower than 20th.

Lastly, Baba Yaga’s besom can be used as a weapon,
functioning as a +4 dancing club. On a successful attack, a
creature struck by the broom is blinded for 1 round.

The broom may have other powers known only to Baba Yaga.

Destruction

Baba Yaga’s besom falls into pieces and is destroyed if it is
used to sweep all of the rooms in all configurations of Baba
Yaga’s Dancing Hut within a 24-hour period.
