Description

Despite its ragged appearance, Saint Cuthbert's Mace is a +5 axiomatic holy disruption heavy mace that allows the bearer to cast the spell searing light at will. Any evil creature that attempts to wield the Mace is damaged as though it were struck by the weapon's searing light ability every round it wields the artifact.

On the 20th of Pharast every year, the mace makes use of greater teleport, interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide), or plane shift to instantly travel to a location anywhere in the multiverse where it is needed, typically appearing where a worthy lawful good wielder will soon pass. The mace's bearer has no control over this effect and is not included in the artifact's teleportation.

Destruction

One who has borne Saint Cuthbert's Mace for a total of 3 years must use it to slay an evil demigod or greater power, causing the weapon to shatter.
