Description

This scar appears on specific individuals at birth, or as a result of powerful but unexplained magical confluences. Anyone with this mark is untethered from reality, and might step out of existence at any moment for indeterminate periods-possibly forever. All of that individual's possessions vanish with him, though occasionally specific items'seemingly of the mark bearer's choosing-are left behind. When and if an individual reappears, he is unharmed and has no knowledge of where he was, and only a vague idea of how much time has passed. Such individuals typically reappear near others who bear the mark.

Destruction

This artifact-level scar affects all the PCs in a party from the point of character creation. When a player can't make it to a session, it gives the GM a way to remove the character from the game (or multiple games) without having to play the absent PC, having another player run the character, or having that character fade mutely into the background. For some parties the Scar of Destiny requires less suspension of disbelief than the other challenges of absent players, though this is not the case for all.
