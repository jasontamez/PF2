Destruction

To destroy an Orb of Dragonshape that transforms the user into a good-aligned dragon, an evil dragon must use the orb to transform and sacrifice itself to save another. To destroy an orb tied to evil dragons, a good dragon must use it to transform and go on a rampage resulting in the death of more than 100 innocents.
