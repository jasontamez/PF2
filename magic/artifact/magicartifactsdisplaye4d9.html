Description

Kazavon's teeth were set into a jeweled circlet of gold, creating the Crown of Fangs. The crown grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution and Charisma, as well as regeneration 20. Only the blade Serithtial (see page 61), a holy avenger, or a paladin's smite evil ability can deal lethal damage to the wearer. Additionally, the wearer gains the personal benefits of the spell foresight.

Destruction

The Crown of Fangs is destroyed if struck by a holy sword forged by a once-mortal god.
