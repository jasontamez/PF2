Description

This is a +6 keen throwing goblinoid bane dwarven waraxe.
Any dwarf who holds it doubles the range of his or her
darkvision. Any non-dwarf who grasps the Axe takes 4 points
of temporary Charisma damage; these points cannot be healed
or restored in any way while the Axe is held. The current
owner of the Axe gains a +10 bonus on Craft (armor, jewelry,
stonemasonry, traps, and weapons) checks. The wielder of
the Axe can summon an elder earth elemental (as summon
monster IX; duration 20 rounds) once per week.

Destruction

The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords rusts away to nothing if it is ever used by a goblin to behead a dwarven king.
