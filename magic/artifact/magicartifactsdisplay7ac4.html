Description

This immense brass, bronze, and crystal orrery models Golarion's solar system as it was in the Age of Legend. If consulted for 10 minutes or more, the orrery grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks to navigate or to answer questions about outer space. Once per month, it can be used to contact alien minds on far-flung worlds-this works identically to the spell <a href="spelldisplay54f1.html?ItemName=contact%20other%20plane">contact other plane</a> (use the demigod line to determine the effects of the spell or ability score decreases).

Destruction

Although it is a minor artifact, the Azlanti orrery can be destroyed by regular damage. It has hardness 20 and 300 hit points.
