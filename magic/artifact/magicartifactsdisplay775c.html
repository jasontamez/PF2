Description

These topaz stones polished by the sea's embrace are carved with powerful runes of the ancient azlanti. these runes bestow two beneficial effects: First, you may pass many azlanti wards and guardians unmolested. Second, the seal stone grants you strange, almost alien insights into all manner of lore, which results in a +4 competence bonus on all Knowledge checks.

Destruction

The secrets of azlanti magic are long lost to modern scholars in golarion. If there is an easy way to destroy an azlanti artifact, it has long since been forgotten.
