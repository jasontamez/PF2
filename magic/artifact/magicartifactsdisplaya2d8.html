Description

The jewel of everlasting gold is a fist-sized ruby mounted  in a bejeweled, rune-carved scepter and held in place with  platinum stems. Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant, crafted  the jewel of everlasting gold to be the centerpiece of his  treasure city, Xin-Grafar. He used the jewel to summon the  city's rivers of molten gold directly from the Elemental Plane  of Earth and to create much of the wealth within the city. He  also placed a small portion of his intelligence inside the  jewel-not enough to make it an intelligent item, but just  enough for the jewel to act on Tar-Baphon's instincts.  Tar-Baphon enshrined the jewel in the heart of Xin-  Grafar, forever the linking it to the city. Should the jewel of  everlasting gold ever be taken beyond the boundaries of the  city, it simply disappears and returns to its perch at the city's  heart. Because he knew thieves would eventually gain access  to the city, Tar-Baphon also created a trap using the powers  of the jewel. Once the city is sealed, the jewel can sense  intruders entering the city. When a trespasser is detected,  Tar-Baphon's trap is activated and the city floods with  molten gold (see page 14). This is an automatic response  that cannot be stopped.

The jewel also has several additional powers, all of  which the bearer knows how to use the moment she  touches the artifact.<ul><li>Clairaudience/Clairvoyance: At will, the bearer of the jewel of  everlasting gold can hear and see what transpires in any part of  Xin-Grafar simply by concentrating on the jewel. This power  functions similar to the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell but can  be used to spy on any location within the city's confines.</li><li>Continual Flame: At will, the bearer of the jewel of everlasting gold  can cause the artifact to burst into harmless flame, as per the  continual flame spell.</li><li>Touch of Gold: Once per day, the bearer of the jewel of everlasting  gold can touch the artifact to a single inanimate object weighing  no more than 1,000 pounds and transmute that object into  pure gold. The object retains its basic shape and appearance,  but it is now composed of solid gold.</li><li>Elemental Transformation: Once per week, the bearer of  the jewel of everlasting gold can transform himself into a  Huge fire elemental, as per the elemental body IV spell. The  transformation lasts as long as the bearer likes, but she cannot  leave the confines of Xin-Grafar while in elemental  form. This ability allows the jewel's bearer to survive  the molten-gold floods.</li><li>Summon Wealth: Once per month, the jewel of  everlasting gold can summon vast sums of wealth from  the Elemental Plane of Earth, in whatever form the bearer  wishes. This ability can only create mundane sources of  wealth, such as art objects, coins, gems, or even rivers  of molten gold-it cannot be used to create items with  magical properties.</li></ul>Because the jewel of everlasting gold contains a portion  of Tar-Baphon's malign will, any wealth created with its  touch of gold ability or summoned with its summon  wealth ability cannot be removed from Xin-Grafar  except by Tar-Baphon himself. Like the jewel itself, any  such treasure taken outside of Xin-Grafar disappears  and reappears scattered throughout the city.

In addition, anyone touching the jewel is contacted  by the fragmentary intelligence inside the gem and hears  disturbing whispers in her mind, urging the character to  claim the jewel and swear fealty to Tar-Baphon. From that  point on, the influence of the jewel is never far from that  character's mind. How this influences a PC is largely up to  the GM. Most good-aligned PCs will feel the influence as a  nagging doubt, a subtle desire to return to the treasure city  and take the jewel in hand again. Chaotic- or evil-aligned PCs  may feel much stronger desires'sometimes overwhelming  urges to return to the jewel no matter the consequences. These  whispering influences can only be completely dispelled by remove  curse or similar magic (requiring a DC 30 caster level check).

Destruction

The jewel of everlasting gold crumbles to dust if thrown into Karzoug's runewell of greed.
