Description

When a mythic creature uses this +6 keen vorpal greataxe forged from a dull black alloy to decapitate his foes, the axe's head glows with dozens of mysterious runes. The wielder of a black iron axe can claim any heads he decapitates with the artifact, and use them as batteries for mythic power. The axe's wielder can place a single use of mythic power into the head as a full-round action for later use. A decapitated head rots and become useless in 1d6 days. Only the creature that placed the use of mythic power in a head can use the power stored within it, and she must be in physical contact with the head to do so. Each head weighs 10 pounds.

Destruction

If a mythic hero uses a black iron axe to decapitate herself, the artifact loses all of its magical properties and becomes a plain iron axe. The uses of mythic power remain in the affected heads after the black iron axe is destroyed.
