Description

Helicyon is a +5 anchoring ghost touch holy quarterstaff. Helicyon can also appear as a walking stick and can assume its true form as a free action. Any time Helicyon deals damage, the creature struck must attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw. If it fails, the target becomes overwrought with remorse for events that took place in the course of its existence, even if it is denied, never had, or lost the capacity to feel emotion, as per overwhelming grief. This effect affects only creatures with Intelligence 3 or greater, even if they are normally immune to mind-affecting effects. Once affected or after a successful saving throw, the target becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. As a standard action, Andoletta can summon Helicyon to her hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries.

Destruction

Helicyon must be broken in the bare hands of an archon whose CR is 20 or greater, while that being renounces Heaven and swears allegiance to an evil master or cause.
