Description

Winter collectors are always located in areas of severe
cold, and are typically surrounded by thick snow or ice.
A winter collector siphons a portion of the ambient cold
weather and condenses it into concentrated cold energy,
which the collector then beams like a signal across worlds
to the winter receiver in the Royal Palace in Whitethrone.
This energy then radiates out to the borders of Irrisen,
keeping the weather in a perpetual wintry state. In
addition, a winter collector functions as a permanent gate,
allowing instant travel from the collector's location to the
Royal Palace (but not in the other direction), even if the
collector is located on the Material Plane.

A winter collector radiates an aura of cold out to 50
feet. This aura deals 6d6 points of cold damage each round
to creatures in this area. Creatures within 10 feet of the
winter collector take 12d6 points of cold damage each
round. Half of this cold damage is not subject to being
reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based effects.

Destruction

Each winter collector has a unique means of destruction,
which is left for the GM to develop, though successfully
destroying a winter collector should be a trial worthy of
gaining a mythic tier.
