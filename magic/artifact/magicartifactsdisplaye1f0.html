Description

This tarnished ring looks like a fiery halo set ablaze in evil-looking fire. The flames are harmless and shed light as an everburning torch; the wearer can suppress or activate these flames as a swift action. A hellfire halo functions as a headband of mental superiority +2 that grants ranks in Intimidate. If the flames of the halo are burning, the wearer becomes immune to the effects of an archon's aura of menace and ignores the protective aura of any angel he attacks. In addition, up to three times per day as he strikes any creature under the effects of a holy aura, the wearer can attempt to dispel that effect as if casting a quickened dispel magic (CL 16th). The first time each day that the wearer is attacked by a creature using smite good, that smite effect immediately ends and is wasted, and the creature making the attack must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Destruction

A hellfire halo can be destroyed by immersing it in holy water and then casting dispel evil on it.
