Description

This staff is a single piece of mithral carved with lines and small dots and encrusted with blue and violet gemstones at either end. The runes marking it are a mixture of Auran and Infernal terms, intertwined. The staff delivers a shocking grasp (CL 15th) to any creature other than the staff's owner that holds it, and no chaotic creature can become its owner. Asserting ownership requires a successful DC 20 Use Magic Device or Charisma check made while holding the staff. Once a creature becomes the staff's owner, it remains so until another creature asserts ownership.

A staff of rightful rule has 10 charges when it is created. In addition to the normal method of recharging staves, spent charges from a staff of rightful rule can be restored by casting dictum into the staff. Each casting restores 1 charge, but the staff may never hold more than 10 charges at any one time. The staff allows use of the following spells: <ul><li>Feather fall (0 charges; functions even if all charges are expended)</li><li>Shocking grasp (1 charge)</li><li>Chain lightning (2 charges)</li><li>Dispel chaos (3 charges)</li></ul>

Destruction

A staff of rightful rule may be destroyed by a word of chaos targeted at the staff. The caster of the spell must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check to destroy the staff. If the caster fails this check, the staff deals 10d6 points of damage to him.
