Description

Crafted from the tailbones of Kazavon, the Staff of the Slain is an intelligent +5 spell storing shock quarterstaff that grants its wielder a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. In addition, the staff allows the wielder to change the energy type of any spell he casts that deals energy damage to electricity (such as causing a fireball to deal electricity damage). The staff harbors two personalities: the neutral good wizard Kolwyddon (dominant during the day) and the dragon Kazavon (dominant at night). Some of the staff's powers change depending on the time of day and which personality is in control.

Destruction

Unknown to either personality, destroying the staff requires submerging it for 24 hours in a pool of silver dragon tears.
