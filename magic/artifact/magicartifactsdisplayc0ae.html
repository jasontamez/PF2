Description

This adamantine quill pen is the greatest weapon <a href="monsterdisplayce09.html?ItemName=Mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a> has in the corruption of souls. As a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can use it to inscribe a <a href="spelldisplayd1eb.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20good">magic circle against good</a> (or chaos), place a <a href="spelldisplay52d9.html?ItemName=mark%20of%20justice">mark of justice</a>, or pen an <a href="rules18f5.html?Name=Infernal%20Contracts&amp;Category=Items">infernal contract</a>. These contracts can grant any number of boons, but typically do so in the form of a <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell or the <%TEMPLATES%Devilbound">devilbound template</a>

. Visineir can be wielded as a +1 adamantine <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7362.html?ItemName=Keen">keen</a> <a href="magicweaponsdisplay05ea.html?ItemName=Wounding">wounding</a> dagger, but Mephistopheles rarely does so, preferring his trident in battle. The quill can store a sample of blood from every creature it strikes, storing up to 33 blood samples at a time. The quill gains the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">bane</a> special ability against any creature whose blood it stores, and it marks the target as if Mephistopheles had used a <a href="witchhexes.html">witch's scar hex</a> on it, allowing him to use his spell-like abilities on that creature with a range of 1 mile (or with unlimited range, if the creature is in Caina). Mephistopheles can expend one stored blood sample as a full-round action to inscribe a symbol spell of any type he wishes, or to call the creature to him as if he had cast <a href="spelldisplay87d5.html?ItemName=planar%20binding,%20greater">greater planar binding</a> (regardless of the creature's actual type-this is not limited to calling outsiders).

Destruction

If Visineir is used to pen a contract that results in Asmodeus having to void the creation of Mephistopheles, the quill crumbles away to ashes, as does Mephistopheles himself.
