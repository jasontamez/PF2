Description

These ancient artifacts function as decks of many things, save that they have only 13 cards: Euryale, Flames, Jester, Key, Knight, Moon, Rogue, Ruin, Skull, Star, Sun, Throne, and The Void.

Destruction

An elder deck can be destroyed by losing it in a wager with a deity of law. The deity must be unaware of the nature of the deck.
