Description

Mog-Lathar is a well-preserved fossil of a gigantic Leng spider that has achieved sentience. Since its discovery in the Mindspin Mountains and subsequent arrival in Bridgefront, the petrified idol's cult has grown to over 300 supplicants. The idol's holy days fall on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, as well as on the northern solstice. Sacrifices are typically in the form of fine goods and deeply intoxicated, lucidly dreaming humanoids.

Despite its imposing petrified bulk, the fossil is relatively brittle for a stone object of its size, with hardness 8, 78 hp, and break DC 35.

The Huge idol can animate at will, as the spell animate object, and can grant divine spells to worshipers up to 5th level with access to the Chaos, Evil, and Trickery domains as a result of selecting the divine source idol ability twice. Its immortal promise ability grants a limited immortality to up to 20 favored worshipers. They do not age; do not need to eat, drink, or breathe; and do not suffer ill effects from extreme heat or cold.

Destruction

Mog-Lathar must be physically transported to the Dimension of Dreams and encased in the webbing of its Leng spider brethren. Once cocooned, a single blow from a silver hammer will turn the idol to dust.
