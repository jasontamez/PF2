Description

A mythic amulet of the Abyss bears the rune of a single demon lord on its face, indicating the lord to which the amulet is attuned. At its basest, a mythic amulet of the Abyss functions as an unholy symbol to this demon lord as well as a phylactery of faithfulness.

A mythic amulet of the Abyss grants its wearer all three of the demon lord's boons, regardless of the wearer's actual level. It grants all of the first boon's spell-like abilities at will. The amulet found in this adventure is associated with Baphomet, and as such it grants the following boons (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2 for details on other demon lords' boons): <ul><li>Beast shape I, misdirection, and summon monster I at will.</li><li>Once per day, the wearer can change shape into a minotaur for 1 hour, gaining a +4 size bonus to Strength and taking a -2 penalty to Charisma. If the wearer is actually a minotaur, she can instead assume a humanoid form at will; this change of form does not alter the wearer's ability scores.</li><li>Extended maze 1/day.</li></ul> Additionally, the wearer of the amulet gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor, immunity to electricity and poison, and resistance 10 to acid, cold, and fire.

Any lawful or good character who wears this amulet gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the amulet is worn. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they can't be overcome in any way as long as the amulet is worn.

Destruction

A mythic amulet of the Abyss can be destroyed as a swift action by the demon lord to which it is attuned, up to a range of 120 feet.
