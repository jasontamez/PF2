Description

Once per day, the bearer of the Fluttered Wing can quietly and soothingly converse with a creature that is at least indifferent toward it. While the bearer does so, she gains a +10 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks against that target. At any point during the conversation, she can cast <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> on the target. When she does so, she can attempt a Bluff check to hide the act of casting the spell as mere words, gaining a +10 bonus on this check; an observer realizes she's casting <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a> only if the result of his own Sense Motive check exceeds the result of this Bluff check.

A character who carries the Fluttered Wing is not affected by effects that detect or reveal falsehoods unless those effects come from 8th- or 9th-level spells.

Destruction

If the Fluttered Wing is bathed in the blood of an innocent while lies about that innocent are chanted aloud for 30 minutes, it crumbles into ash.
