Description

This tome bestows the ability to use the spells within its pages
upon any bearer of any class. However, a bearer not already able
to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in
her possession or while she makes use of its powers. A book of
infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is
determined by a d% roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell.
Determine the exact spell randomly.

Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging
through the book is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it
always opens again to the page it was on before the book was
closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.

Once per day, the owner of the book can cast the spell to
which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one
that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to
four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without
destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as if
from a scroll, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their
magic is bound permanently within the book itself.

The owner of the book need not have the book in her
possession in order to use its power. The book can be stored
elsewhere and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of
its power, so long as no other creature attempts to make use
of the book, in so doing becoming its owner.

Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy
connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite
all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell
the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Condition</td><td>Chance of Page Turning</td></tr>
<tr><td>Caster employing a spell usable by own class and level</td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Caster employing a spell not usable by own class and level</td><td>20%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nonspellcaster employing divine spell</td><td>25%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Nonspellcaster employing arcane spell</td><td>30%</td></tr></table>
Treat each spell use as if a scroll were being employed, for
purposes of determining casting time, spell failure, and so on.

Destruction

The book of infinite spells can be destroyed when the current page contains the erase spell, by casting the spell on the book itself.
