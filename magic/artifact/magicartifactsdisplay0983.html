Description

Each of these distinctive jars contains an organ associated with both a trait of the valiant knight Arazni and an aspect of the lingering power of the god Aroden. Any cleric who bears one of these jars is granted an additional domain, with the associated granted powers and domain spells, for as long as he possesses it. The domain granted depends on the Bloodstone possessed. If the bearer is not a cleric, he is granted the lowest-level domain power, but no spells or other related abilities. In addition, the bearer of a Bloodstone is inspired by some trait of Arazni, gaining an ability she possessed in life. The bearer does not need to meet any prerequisites or requirements to gain this ability.

Lung Bloodstone of Arazni



This canopic jar containing <a href="deitydisplayea52.html?ItemName=Arazni">Arazni's</a> preserved lungs echoes with Arazni's sense of duty and the lingering power of the dead god Aroden. The bearer of the Lung Bloodstone of Arazni gains <a href="featdisplay19f3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Iron%20Will">Improved Iron Will</a> as a bonus feat. Any cleric who bears the jar is granted the <a href="domaindisplayf339.html?ItemName=Knowledge">Knowledge</a> domain as an additional domain, with the associated granted powers and domain spells, for as long as she bears it. If the bearer is not a cleric, she instead gains the lore keeper ability of the Knowledge domain, treating her character level as her cleric level.

Destruction

Together, the tyrant Geb and the lich Arazni can destroy any of the Bloodstones, binding the organ inside into the withered form of the fallen hero as part of a 24-hour-long ritual.
