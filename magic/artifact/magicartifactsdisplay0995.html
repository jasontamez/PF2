Description

Ovinrbaane (literally translated as "enemy of all enemies") is a cursed, intelligent +3 wounding greatsword. When Ovinrbaane succeeds at a contest of will (Core Rulebook 535), it uses modify memory to mislead its wielder into believing he's the barbarian warlord Armag and that anyone around him who isn't obviously a member of his tribe is a mortal enemy. The cursed greatsword also slowly changes the features of the wielder over the course of several days or even weeks to appear as those of the original Armag. If left unchecked, these powers seemingly bring the warlord back to life, recreating the savage warrior it deems to be its own true wielder.

Destruction

To destroy Ovinrbaane, its wielder must bring it to the Boneyard and strike three blows against his own gravestone, causing the sword to shatter.
