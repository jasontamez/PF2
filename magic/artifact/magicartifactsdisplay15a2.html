Description

The Shard of Envy is made of shimmering green noqual. As long as the Shard of Envy is carried, its owner can use dispel magic as a spell-like ability once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus abjuration spells and spell-like abilities, and gains a +1 insight bonus to AC.

Curse: The owner covets the success, wealth, and appearance of all other creatures, and becomes sickened whenever she is within 30 feet of any creature of the same race or character class as herself. Physical contact with such a creature nauseates the owner for 2d6 rounds if she fails a DC 20 Fortitude save.

Destruction

A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can one destroy the shards.
