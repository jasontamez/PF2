Description

Pazuzu's weapon is the Scepter of Shibaxet, a staff of black metal with a large hook at its tip. The scepter functions as a rod of enemy detection that can be used any number of times per day. If Pazuzu presents the scepter as a standard action, all creatures within 30 feet who view it become panicked for 1d6 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 23 Will save (this is a mindaffecting fear effect). Once per day, Pazuzu can use the Scepter of Shibaxet as a rod of cancellation (this does not deplete or harm the scepter). As a standard action, he can call the scepter to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As an immediate action, Pazuzu can transform the scepter into a +5 anarchic keen unholy longsword or return it to its normal shape. None of its other powers can be used in sword form.

Destruction

The Scepter of Shibaxet can be broken by a redeemed demon lord if the regenerating towers of Shibaxet are already destroyed.
