Description

This horned and frilled dragon's head is coated with a thick layer of white lime. When dropped from a height of at least 150 feet, the tathlum detonates in an explosion of greasy darkness, dealing 20d6 points of damage to all creatures within a 150-foot-radius spread from its point of impact (Will DC 25 half). Good or lawful living creatures with 9 Hit Dice or fewer within this area must also succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or die. This area is immediately affected by unhallow with darkness as an associated spell effect. In addition, concussive force blasts outward from the darkness, dealing 10d6 points of damage to all creatures within the area between 150 feet and 300 feet from the impact point (Will DC 21 half). The tathlum is consumed in the explosion.

If at least 200 Hit Dice worth of creatures are killed by the tathlum's detonation, the explosion spontaneously creates 1d6 nightwalkers (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 201) within 150 feet of the point of impact. On particularly dense battlefields, the detonation instead creates 1d6 warsworns (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 272). These undead creatures are free-willed and not under the control of the tathlum's wielder.

If the tathlum is dropped from a height of less than 150 feet, it deals 3d6 points of damage to a single creature as a falling object (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 443), plus an additional 2d6 points of damage if the target is good or lawful. The tathlum takes no damage and is not destroyed if dropped from a height of less than 150 feet.

Destruction

If dropped from a height of 150 feet or more, the tathlum detonates and is permanently destroyed.
