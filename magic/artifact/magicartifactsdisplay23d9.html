Description

The Bound Blade is a +3 unholy adamantine bastard sword, forged from the claws of Kazavon. For worshipers of Abadar, the Bound Blade is heresy made manifest. The sword grants the user a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength. As a free action, upon using the sword to reduce a sentient living creature to 0 or fewer hit points, the wielder can cast soul bind, forcing that creature to make a successful DC 25 Will save or have its soul trapped within the sword. While there is a soul trapped within the sword, the Bound Blade emanates the effects of the spell desecrate in a 50-foot-radius aura. This aura lasts for a number of days equal to the number of Hit Dice the slain creature possessed. After that period passes, the soul within the sword is destroyed and cannot be restored by any method short of divine intervention. The sword wielder can release a trapped soul by using the blade's soul bind ability on another creature.

Destruction

The Bound Blade shatters if used by a paladin of Abadar to slay a fallen paladin dedicated to Zon-Kuthon.
