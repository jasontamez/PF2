Description

This small adamantine loop and handle is typically fitted with
a fine adamantine chain so that it can be worn as a necklace.
A talisman of the sphere is worse than useless to those unable
to cast arcane spells. Characters who cannot cast arcane spells
take 5d6 points of damage merely from picking up and holding
a talisman of this sort. However, when held by an arcane
spellcaster who is concentrating on control of a sphere of
annihilation, a talisman of the sphere doubles the character's
modifier on his control check (doubling both his Intelligence
bonus and his character level for this purpose).

If the wielder of a talisman establishes control, he needs
to check for maintaining control only every other round
thereafter. If control is not established, the sphere moves
toward him. Note that while many spells and effects of
cancellation have no effect upon a sphere of annihilation, the
talisman's power of control can be suppressed or canceled.

Destruction

A talisman of the sphere can be destroyed only by throwing the item into a sphere of annihilation.
