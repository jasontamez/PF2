Description

This wooden mortar for grinding is 4 feet tall and 14 inches in
diameter, and can hold up to 4 cubic feet of dry goods. Its pestle
is about 8 feet long and carved of the same dense wood. It can be
used as a weapon, functioning as a +1 quarterstaff. On command, the mortar and pestle shrink down small enough
to fit in a belt pouch and weigh only 3 pounds. The
mortar must be empty to shrink.

The mortar and pestle can be commanded to
grind any object placed inside; each round, the
object takes 3d6 points of damage that bypasses
hardness. Any object reduced to 0 hit points in
this manner is ground into powder. Magic items
can attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save each round to avoid taking
damage. Artifacts can't be destroyed in the mortar and pestle.

The mortar is large enough to hold a single Medium creature,
but it can enlarge to hold up to four Medium creatures or one
Large creature. The mortar can be commanded to fly at a speed
of 30 feet as overland flight, for up to 8 hours per day. Using
the pestle to steer the mortar grants a +10 bonus on Fly checks.
Twice per day, the mortar can create a single-use phase door
that closes behind the mortar. Baba Yaga can summon her
mortar and pestle to fly to her from anywhere on the same
planet, regardless of the commands of any creatures inside it.

With the exception of using the pestle as a weapon, the
mortar and pestle must be together to use the their abilities.

Destruction

Baba Yaga's mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are used under the light of a moon that shines on three worlds to grind to powder the hipbone of a maiden, the ribcage of a mother, and the spine of a crone-all taken from the same person.
