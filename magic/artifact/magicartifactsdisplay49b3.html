Description

The crown of an infamous undead tyrant, the Horns of Naraga
are a symbol of dominance over death. When worn by an
undead creature, the Horns of Naraga reduce all damage
taken from positive energy by half. In addition, whenever
the wearer touches a living creature while wearing this helm
(even if the touch is part of casting a spell or another touch
attack), the touch deals an additional 5d6 points of negative
energy damage and the wearer gains these hit points, just
as if he had cast vampiric touch. The wearer of the helm is
immune to acid and can see perfectly in darkness of any
kind, even that created by magic. Once per day on command,
the helm can be ordered to transform into an ancient
black dragon that unquestioningly obeys the creature that
summoned it for 1 hour before reverting to a helm. Slaying
the dragon does not destroy the helm, but it does prevent
this ability from being used for 1 week. While the helm is in
dragon form, the helm's owner does not receive any of the
helm's other benefits.

Destruction

The helm can be destroyed by crushing it between the jaws of an ancient black dragon's skull in the middle of a desert with the sun at its zenith.
