Description

A set of runewarded gauntlets helps to protect the wearer from the influence of intelligent magic items, an effect that immediately becomes apparent to a wearer when the gauntlets are first put on. While worn, the gauntlets suppress all magical qualities of a single intelligent weapon carried. They have no effect on nonintelligent magic weapons or nonweapon intelligent magic items. Runewarded gauntlets make spellcasting more difficult when worn, imparting a 10% spell failure chance to all spells cast while worn (not just arcane spells). This spell failure chance does not stack with spell failure chances from other worn items.

Destruction

If a creature wears a set of runewarded gauntlets and then plunges his hands into the runeforge pool, where the gauntlets were created ages ago, any blow struck against the submerged gauntlets by a character currently controlled by an intelligent weapon of a different alignment than the wearer of the gauntlets destroys the gauntlets (and the wearer's hands). Missing hands can be restored via <a href="spelldisplayb175.html?ItemName=regenerate">regenerate</a> or similar effects.
