Description

This delicate circlet appears to be made of living blue-green vines with tiny leaves. Clearly of elven manufacture, the interlocking vines occasionally shift and grasp each other in new configurations. In the springtime the crown sprouts crystalline flowers which eventually fall off but retain their beauty (the elven monarch has a tradition of giving these flowers to favored citizens).

The oldest legends of Kyonin's elves seem to indicate that there was a time when their ruler did not wear the Viridian Crown, but only a handful of fragmentary tales survive from that prehistory. In elven memory it has always been part of the crown jewels. The crown is a living thing that grows according to its wearer's will. In centuries where war is the norm the crown tends to grow thorns in a helm-like configuration, while in times of peace it prunes itself to become delicate and artistic.

At will you may use detect poison, heal, light, or break enchantment as a standard action. Once per day you may use heroes' feast and resurrection.

If you are the properly anointed ruler of the Kyonin elves, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. You may use scrying at will on any of your subjects (any elf who acknowledges your authority as the elven monarch). You and any subjects within 60 feet gain the benefits of a good hope spell at all times. Three times per day while within Kyonin you may create a guards and wards effect.
