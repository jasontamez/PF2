Description

If this small scarab brooch is held for more than 1 round or
carried in a living creature's possessions for 1 minute, it
changes into a horrible, burrowing, beetlelike creature. The
thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into flesh,
and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A
DC 25 Reflex save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away
before it burrows out of sight, but she still takes 3d6 points of
damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab form. Placing
the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal prevents it from coming to life and allows for long-term
storage of the item.
