Description

Appearing to be a wide leather belt that functions as a belt
of mighty constitution +4, this belt in fact saps the wearer's
health rather than supplement it. A belt of weakness confers
a -4 penalty to its wearer's Constitution score. Furthermore,
when the wearer rolls a natural 1 on any Fortitude save, the
belt constricts, dealing 2d8 points of damage.
