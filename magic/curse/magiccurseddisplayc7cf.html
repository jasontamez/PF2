Description

This headband appears to be a headband of vast intellect
+4, but instead of granting a +4 bonus to Intelligence and
bonuses to associated skills, the wearer take a -4 penalty
to Intelligence and a further -2 penalty on all Knowledge
checks. The wearer is not aware of the debilitating effects
of the headband; even the stupidest statement or misguided
insight seems intelligent to him while he is wearing it.
