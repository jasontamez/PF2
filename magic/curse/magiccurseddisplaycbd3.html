Description

This cloak appears to be a finely made garment that radiates
protective magic. The cloak can be handled or examined
without harm, but when it is put on, it immediately bursts
into flames that burn continuously but do not harm the cloak,
only its wearer. The cloak deals 1d6 points of fire damage
each round and cannot be removed unless the curse is broken.
Sufficient amounts of water or other smothering materials can
douse the flames temporarily, but the cloak reignites when
exposed to air again. Spells like resist energy, protection from
energy, and similar effects can protect the wearer against the
cloak's flames while they last.
