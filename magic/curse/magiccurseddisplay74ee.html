Description

A necklace of strangulation appears to be a
wondrous piece of magical jewelry. When placed
on the neck, the necklace immediately tightens,
dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot
be removed by any means short of a limited
wish, wish, or miracle, and remains clasped around the victim's throat even after his death. Only when he
has decayed to a dry skeleton (after approximately 1 month)
does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.
