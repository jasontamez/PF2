Description

This simple musical instrument seems and behaves in all
ways like any other kind of magical pipes until its owner
plays it in an urban setting. Once he does, it requires
all people within hearing range to make a DC 15 Will
saving throw to avoid falling into a murderous fury. Those
who fail their saves gain the effects of a rage spell for
the next 1d6 hours and experience a strong compulsion
(DC 15 Will save negates) to attack any stranger or
disliked person whom they encounter during this time.
If the owner spends more than 3 consecutive days in an
urban setting, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw each
day to avoid playing the riot pipes at some point during each
subsequent day. The pipes remain with the player until the
curse is broken.
