Description

This staff appears to be an ordinary staff and functions normally as such until it is used in combat. The wielder's effective caster level drops to match that of the staff or the wielder's caster level - 4, whichever is lower. The wielder's spellcasting ability score drops to 10 + staff's highest spell level, unless it is already lower.

The wielder must employ the staff rather than any other melee weapon or spell trigger item. Even if the staff is fully charged, the caster fails to regain spell slots for the day unless she forgoes a spell slot to restore 1 charge to the staff. However, she never again regains a spell slot used to charge the staff until she is freed from the curse. The only way for the wielder to be rid of the staff is by miracle or wish.
