Description

This small, 6-inch-square glass tablet grows to a 6-foot-by-
3-foot window if placed on any sufficiently large vertical
surface and returns to its original size if removed. The
window melds ever so slightly into the surface, allowing it
to ignore minor protrusions, curves, or anything else that
would normally make it difficult to simply lay down a pane
of glass.

On command, the front of this glass displays all activities
on the other side of this surface like a window, piercing
wood, earth, or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal.
The window does not reveal its existence to non-hostile
creatures depicted within it, allowing observers to study
them at their leisure.

However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy
on hostile creatures, its curse activates. From that moment
on, the window presents its owner and anyone looking
through the window with an artificial image of the other
side designed to lull them into a sense of false confidence-
enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank
bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While presenting this
image to those in front of the mirror, it reveals those viewers
to the enemies being observed, creating a two-way window;
however, viewed creatures see those using the mirror
accurately and can read their thoughts as if using detect
thoughts. Furthermore, the image shown to those using the
mirror does not reveal that the creatures they are watching
can see them as well.

Once the curse activates, the owner comes to regard using
the mirror to spy ahead as his most effective tactic (after all,
it has no limit to its duration) and does so whenever possible
until curse-breaking magic frees him from its influence.
Anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles, even if he
wasnâ€™t the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to this
desire to continue using it.
