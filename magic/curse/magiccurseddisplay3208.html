Description

This weapon appears to be a +2 returning throwing axe.
Instead of the normal returning ability, this axe only returns when the wielder misses her target. When it does return,
it attacks the wielder. It uses the wielder's full base attack
bonus with this attack. If it hits, it sticks in the wielder, and
the wielder can pull out the axe with a swift action. If it misses
the wielder, it falls to a random unoccupied square adjacent
to the wielder and must be picked up as soon as possible. The
wielder of the deadly returns throwing axe always uses it as
her primary weapon until subject to a remove curse spell or
similar effect.
