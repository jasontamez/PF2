Description

This strange, featureless mask seems to have the powers of
a headband of alluring charisma +4, but instead of granting
a bonus to Charisma, the mask melds to the wearer's face,
making him seem uglier and his words come off as crude and
insulting. The wearer takes a -4 penalty to Bluff and Diplomacy
checks but gains a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks.
