Description

This ring operates exactly like a ring of feather falling. However,
it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a -4 penalty to
Dexterity and has a 20% chance of spell failure when trying to
cast any arcane spell that has a somatic component. (This chance
of spell failure stacks with other arcane spell failure chances.)
