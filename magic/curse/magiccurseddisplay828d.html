Description

This weapon appears and acts as a +2 glaive, but cannot be used
to make attacks of opportunity, and hinders its wielder whenever
such an attack is attempted. When its wielder attempts an
attack of opportunity, the glaive flails around madly, causing its
wielder to become unbalanced. The wielder takes a -2 penalty
to AC and on attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
