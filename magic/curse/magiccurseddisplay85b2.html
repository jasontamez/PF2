Description

This engraved gem appears to be of little value. If any
character keeps the periapt in her possession for more
than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that
permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and
Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be
removed only by application of a remove curse spell followed
by a cure disease and then a heal, miracle, limited wish, or
wish spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a
periapt of health and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted
character (a full-round action), whereupon the periapt of foul
rotting likewise crumbles to dust.
