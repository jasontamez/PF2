Description

This rod is similar in appearance to a metamagic rod. Once a
creature picks up such a rod, it cannot be discarded without
use of a remove curse spell or similar magic. Each time the
wielder casts a spell, he takes the rod of foiled magic in hand
and treats the caster level of the spell as 2 levels lower. If this
would reduce the caster level to 0 or lower, than the caster has
only a 50% chance of casting the spell (any chance of arcane
spell failure is added to this percentile chance), but if he is able
to cast the spell, the spell has a caster level of 1st.
