Description

This blade seems to be and behaves in all ways as a sword of
subtlety until actually used in combat. Once used in combat,
it imposes a -10 penalty on all Stealth checks made by its
wielder. It also makes it nearly impossible for the owner to
tell a lie or engage in any other sort of subterfuge. Each time
he does so, he must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid
blurting out the truth or taking some other involuntary action
that spoils his attempted ruse. Only curse-ending magic can rid
the wielder of the sword once its curse activates.
