Description

This fine dust appears to be dust of appearance. If cast into
the air, it causes those within a 20-foot spread to fall into fits of
sneezing and coughing. Those who fail a DC 15 Fortitude save
take 3d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. Those
who succeed on this saving throw are nonetheless disabled by
choking (treat as stunned) for 5d4 rounds.
