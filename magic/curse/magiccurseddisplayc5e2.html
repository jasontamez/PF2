Description

Most bags of devouring appear to be normal sacks, but
Chomper is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows
of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all
things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is the
favored maw and most important appendage of a creature
it mysteriously refers to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates
all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred
spirits of destruction.

Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag
of devouring, along with the following additional powers.
<ul><li>As a standard action, Chomper’s possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any single creature
or unattended item within a 5-foot radius. Chomper (not
the wielder) can then make a single bite attack against the
target. This bite has a +14 attack bonus and deals 1d10+5
points of damage plus 2 points of bleed damage. This action
does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made in
this way are never modified by the wielder’s abilities.
</li><li>When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag’s
cursed aura imparts a –1 penalty on all of its wielder’s
attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
If Chomper manages to gain dominance over a non-demon
wielder through a personality conflict, it directs its bearer
to seek out victims to feed to it.</li></ul>
