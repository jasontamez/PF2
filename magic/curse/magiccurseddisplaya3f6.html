Description

This longsword performs well against targets in practice,
but when used in combat its wielder takes a -2 penalty on
attack rolls.

All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never
below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful hit.
The sword always forces that character to employ it rather
than another weapon. The sword's owner automatically
draws it and fights with it even when she meant to draw or
ready some other weapon.
