Description

This delicate ring appears to be a ring of spell storing or
a ring of spell turning, but instead of aiding casting or
counterspelling, the ring hinders such efforts. Each time
the wearer casts an arcane spell, he suffers a 25% spell
failure chance. Furthermore, the wearer of the ring takes
a -4 penalty on Spellcraft checks to identify a spell when
attempting to counterspell. The ring can only be removed
by a remove curse spell or a similar effect.
