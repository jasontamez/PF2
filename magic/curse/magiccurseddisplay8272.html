Description

This mummified monkey's hand bears the power to grant three wishes, but at a terrible cost. The paw can grant any request within the power of a wish spell, but the paw's curse twists the results to bring about despair. For example, a wish to prevent an erupting volcano from burying a town might drain the magma vault beneath the volcano, resulting in the town being swallowed up in a sinkhole when the vault collapses into a caldera. Careful wording to avoid negative effects simply results in the attempt failing without expending a wish. When the monkey's paw grants a wish, it writhes in the holder's grasp.

Once the third wish of a monkey's paw is used, it loses its power for those who used the wishes and their acquaintances, but regains its power once passed on to a stranger.
