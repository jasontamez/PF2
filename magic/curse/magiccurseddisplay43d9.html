Description

This staff appears as a normal staff of electricity, except it is black instead of silver and electricity occasionally arcs along the shaft. The curse on this weapon alters the shocking grasp, lightning bolt, and chain lightning spells granted by the staff, causing extra surges of energy to damage the wielder and his allies.

When the wielder uses the overcharged staff to cast shocking grasp, he takes 1d3 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d3). When the wielder uses the overcharged staff to cast lightning bolt, a random ally takes 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6); the ally takes half that amount with a successful Reflex save. When the wielder uses the overcharged staff to cast chain lightning, for each target the wielder chooses as a primary or secondary target, a random ally must be chosen as a secondary target.
