Description

A staff of occasional wonder can appear to be any magical
staff, and in fact such items are usually the result of accidents
during an attempted crafting of the staff it appears to be. It
usually functions as intended, but each time someone uses
the staff, they must roll d%. On a roll of 1-10, instead of
the desired effect, the staff acts like a rod of wonder (see
page 185).
