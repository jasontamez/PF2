Description

This cloak is usually made of wool,
although it can be made of leather.
A detect poison spell can reveal the
presence of poison in the cloak's fabric.
The garment can be handled without
harm, but as soon as it is actually
donned, the wearer takes 4d6 points
of Constitution damage unless she
succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.

Once donned, a poisonous cloak can be removed only with a
remove curse spell; doing this destroys the magical property of
the cloak. If a neutralize poison spell is then used, it is possible
to revive a dead victim with a raise dead or resurrection spell.

Construction

Requirements cloak of arachnida, cloak of the bat, cloak of etherealness,
cloak of resistance +5, major cloak of displacement; Cost &mdash;
