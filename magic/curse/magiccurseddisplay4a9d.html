Description

This cursed scrying device is at first glance indistinguishable
from a normal crystal ball. However, anyone attempting to
use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes,
and a telepathic suggestion is implanted in her mind (Will DC
19 negates).

The user of the device believes that she viewed the desired
creature or scene through the ball, but she actually came
under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some
power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the
crystal hypnosis ball's gazer deeper under the influence of the
controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout
this time, the user remains unaware of her subjugation.
