Description

These bejeweled and shining bracers initially appear to be
bracers of armor +5 and actually serve as such until the wearer
is attacked in anger by an enemy with a Challenge Rating equal
to or greater than her level. At that moment and thereafter,
the bracers bestow a -5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is
activated, bracers of defenselessness can be removed only by
means of a remove curse spell.
