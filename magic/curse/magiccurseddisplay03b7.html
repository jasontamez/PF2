Description

A robe of powerlessness appears to be a magic robe of
another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she
takes a -10 penalty to Strength, as well as to Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma, forgetting spells and magic
knowledge accordingly. If the character is a spellcaster,
the robe targets the character's primary spellcasting score,
otherwise it targets Intelligence. The robe can be removed
easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character
must receive a remove curse spell followed by heal.
