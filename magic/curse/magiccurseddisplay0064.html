Description

This bag appears to be an ordinary
sack. Detection for magical properties
makes it seem as if it were a bag
of holding. The sack, however, is
something entirely different and more
insidious-one of the feeding orifices
of an extradimensional creature.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject
to "swallowing’’ if thrust within the bag. The bag of
devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but
anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as
if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it
is 60% likely to close around the offending appendage and
attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus
on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a
creature, it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag
has a CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free.

The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a
bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative
chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff
out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn
within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim’s
body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that
requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish,
miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim
to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails,
the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.
