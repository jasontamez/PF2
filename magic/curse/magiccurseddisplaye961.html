Description

Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of
+3 full plate. The armor works normally with regard to melee
attacks but actually attracts ranged weapons. The wearer
takes a -15 penalty to AC against ranged weapons. The true
nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is
fired upon in earnest.
