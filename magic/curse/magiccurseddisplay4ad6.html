Description

These steel pauldrons seem to be emblazoned with stampeding
horses until they are worn, and then the horses change shape
to that of dumfounded donkeys. The wearer of these pauldrons
takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity and reduces all speeds by 10
feet. A successful remove curse spell is required before this
item can be removed.
