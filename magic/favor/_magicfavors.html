Favors are a category of single-use magic items that are activated when given by one creature (called the presenter) to another (the recipient). The presenter must intentionally give the favor to the recipient, and the recipient must intentionally accept it and don it within 1 minute for the favor to activate. Giving a favor to a recipient is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity; receiving and donning a favor requires as much time as it takes to don an item of the favor's type (usually a standard action). Once donned, the favor provides the indicated effect for the listed duration. In addition, while the favor is active, the presenter can take a standard action to sense whether the recipient is alive (with 4 or more hit points), badly wounded (at 3 or fewer hit points), dead, undead, or neither alive nor dead (as a construct). This effect functions regardless of distance, as long as the presenter and recipient are on the same plane of existence.

The favor's effects end immediately if the favor is removed or otherwise leaves the recipient's possession, or if the recipient fails a saving throw against a fear effect. For this latter reason, favors are preferred by creatures immune or resistant to fear, such as paladins and halflings. A creature can be the recipient of only one favor at a time; if the recipient voluntarily accepts a new favor, the effects of any existing favor immediately end. Once a favor's duration expires or its effects end, the presenter is immediately aware that the favor has lost its magic.
