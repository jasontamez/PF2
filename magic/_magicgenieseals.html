Genie Seals


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/legacyOfFire/v5748btpy87ux">Pathfinder #22: The End of Eternity</a>
Although they are created in the same way as other wondrous items, genie seals are not themselves items that characters can "use." A genie seal must be crafted directly onto a receptacle that is already being used to contain a genie via a binding spell (although the creator of a genie seal need not be the same person who bound the genie into the receptacle). A single receptacle may only have one genie seal on it-attempting to place a second seal immediately frees the genie trapped within. Note that the price listed for a genie seal represents the minimum an entire genie bottle or lamp should go for on the open market. As a general rule, a bound genie is fantastically expensive, worth 100,000 gp or even more if the bound genie can grant wishes.

Description

This magic metal imprint is a genie seal, a special type of item that must be crafted onto a receptacle that holds a genie via the minimus containment effect of a binding spell. Binding usually has an ending trigger condition set by the binder, such as services the genie must perform before the spell can come to an end.

When applied to an appropriate receptacle that contains a bound genie, the Garden of Sulesh gives a measure of freedom to the bottled genie in exchange for a greater demand from the binder. The genie can freely leave and return to its bottle whenever the bottle is not physically sealed. The genie is unable to move its bottle on its own, and is prevented from moving more than 300 feet from the bottle by indestructible golden chains of force.

While crafting the seal onto a genie's receptacle, the crafter can edit the ending trigger conditions of the binding spell used to trap the genie. The new trigger condition must be a task that the genie could feasibly accomplish (though a bound genie's nigh-immortal lifespan can allow for far-reaching demands). Each year that the genie fails to complete this task, it must grant one wish to the binder if able. A genie under this seal is otherwise unable to grant wishes until its task is complete.

If the genie is restrained or prevented from working on its task, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that the genie into a berserk state because it can't engage in its all-consuming task. A creature actively working against the genie's task increases this chance by an additional 1% every round it remains within the genie's sight. A berserk genie attacks any creature within 300 feet of its bottle. A genie that has no further targets for its fury exits its berserk state and returns to its task after 1 minute, resetting the berserk chance to 0%.

Only one genie seal can be crafted onto a container; if a second seal is crafted onto a genie's container, the genie is immediate freed from service. If a seal is destroyed or removed, a new one can be crafted onto the receptacle.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, binding, geas/quest, creator must have personally bound the genie contained within the receptacle upon which the seal is to be placed; Cost 28,000 gp</td>

Slot genie seal; Price 10,000 gp; Weight &mdash;

Description

This seal is a disk of mithral inscribed with dozens of spiraling arcane and magical sigils. As long as the seal is carried visibly, the carrier can speak and understand all of the elemental tongues. Furthermore, he gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks made against genies, as long as he speaks in the genie's native tongue. Language-dependant spells cast by the carrier of interpretation of secrets are enhanced-any genie that is targeted by such a spell suffers a -2 penalty on any saving throw to resist the effect of the spell.

Aura moderate enchantment; CL 9th
Slot genie seal; Price 12,000 gp; Weight &mdash;

Description

This seal is perhaps the most hated by geniekind, for it uses the power of the imprisoned genie to dominate other elemental creatures. The master of four quarters is made of ivory and set with red and blue jewels at the corners. Once per day, a character who takes a standard action to present the seal and the bottle it graces can use a charm monster spell against a single elemental creature in range of the spell. The targeted elemental can resist the charm with a DC 16 Will save, but if the targeted elemental has the same elemental subtype as that of the imprisoned genie, the elemental suffers a -4 penalty to his saving throw.

<td>Tongue of the Hidden

Aura faint divination; CL 5th
Slot genie seal; Price 3,000 gp; Weight &mdash;

Description

The least of the great seals, the tongue of the hidden is generally made of pewter inlaid with gold and tarnished silver. When this seal is in place, the genie within can see and hear his environs as if he were not imprisoned in a receptacle. Furthermore, the genie can speak via a magic mouth effect and can decide to have the magic mouth actually appear on the seal or not. The genie cannot cast spells through this link.

<td>True Seal of Sulesh (Major Artifact)

Description

Of all the genie seals Sulesh created, none were as powerful and potent as his true seal-and Sulesh himself was never quite able to replicate its creation. This seal is a disc of gold the size of a dinner plate, engraved and set with silver, lead, and mithral. Unlike most genie seals, the true seal of Sulesh can be removed from a bound genie prison and attached to another. Removing or attaching the true seal is a full-round action.

Once the seal is attached to an occupied genie bottle, it functions as a combined tongue of the hidden and interpretation of secrets. Once per day as a swift action, the carrier of the true seal may use a dominate spell against any genie in range (Will DC 23 negates)-only one genie may be dominated at a time by the true seal of Sulesh. The carrier of the true seal of Sulesh can also use any spell-like abilities possessed by a genie trapped within the receptacle to which the true seal is attached, as if the genie himself were using the spell-like ability (although the carrier of the seal gets to decide how the ability is used).

Destruction

To destroy the true seal of Sulesh, it must be placed upon a genie prison containing a genie of at least CR 20, whereupon the prison (seal and all) must be cast into the eternal vortex at the heart of the Maelstrom.</td>
