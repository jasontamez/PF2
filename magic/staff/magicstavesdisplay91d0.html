Description

Whenever the user is holding this wooden staff, 10 bulging eyes carved along the length of the staff animate, granting the user a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks as long as he is grasping the staff. As a move action, the wielder can select a creature  ithin 100 feet and see through its eyes with no saving throw. The creature selected must be either a spider summoned with the staff or a creature blinded by a blindness/deafness spell cast from the staff (the wielder ignores the blindness/deafness effect). The connection lasts as long as the wielder and the target creature remain within 100 feet of each other, though the wielder can end it as a free action. The effect also ends if the target was a blinded creature and regains the ability to see. The wielder is blinded while maintaining this connection.

The staff allows the use of the following spells.<ul> <li>Blindness/deafness (blindness only; 1 charge)</li> <li>Summon monster II (giant spider only; 1 charge)</li> <li>Prying eyes (3 charges)</li></ul>
