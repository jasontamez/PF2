Description

This slender silver cane feels more unwieldy than its low weight might suggest, as if a hidden force fights its wielder for control. The staff functions as a +1/+1 anchoring mithral quarterstaff, and allows use of the following spells. <ul><li>Kinetic reverberation (1 charge)</li><li>Force hook charge (2 charges)</li><li>Force punch (2 charges)</li></ul> As long as the staff's anchoring special ability is in effect, these spells work differently when cast by the wielder, as noted below.

Kinetic reverberation not only damages an attacker's weapon, but also pushes the attacker away. Immediately after the spell's damage is dealt, as an immediate action, the wielder may attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against his attacker, using his opponent's attack bonus as his combat maneuver bonus. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity and the wielder does not move with his opponent.

Force hook charge pulls the target to a square adjacent to the staff on a successful ranged touch attack, rather than pulling the staff and wielder toward the target. The spell's target may resist this pull with a successful Fortitude save. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Force punch deals 1d6 points of force damage to its target per caster level (maximum 10d6) against an opponent that is affected by the staff's anchoring special ability, rather than 1d4 points of force damage per caster level. An anchored opponent is not pushed away.
