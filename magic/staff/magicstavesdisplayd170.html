Description

This gnarled wooden staff is bedecked with broken charms and burnt fetishes that were once used to ward against bad luck, but now are in shambles. The staff allows use of the following spells: <ul><li>Blindness/deafness (1 charge)</li><li>Ill omen (1 charge; Advanced Player's Guide)</li><li>Baleful polymorph (2 charges)</li><li>Bestow curse (2 charges)</li></ul> In addition, the staff of curses is a +1/+1 quarterstaff, and whenever the wielder strikes a creature with the staff, he can expend one charge to cause the creature to become cursed for a number of rounds equal to the number of charges remaining in the staff. While this curse persists, the creature takes a -2 penalty on saving throws from spells cast from the staff and a -2 penalty to AC against any attacks made by the staff.
