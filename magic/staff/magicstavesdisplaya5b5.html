Description

This staff is made from high-quality wood and festooned with brass rods and keys, looking almost like an instrument. The staff allows use of the following spells: <ul><li>Ghost sound (1 charge)</li><li>Piercing shriek (1 charge; Ultimate Magic)</li><li>Sculpt sound (2 charges)</li><li>Wall of sound (2 charges; Ultimate Magic)</li></ul> In addition, as a swift action, the wielder of the musical staff can cause it to transform into a string or wind instrument. Any Perform skill checks made with the musical staff gain a +5 competence bonus. The staff can still be used to cast spells while it is an instrument, and it can revert back to a staff as a free action.
