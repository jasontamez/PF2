Description

These staves are often made of darkwood and topped with the holy symbol of Nethys, the eyes of which are made of rare gems that glow with magical energy. While the upper end of the staff (along with its symbol) always appears clean and pristine, the lower end of the staff's shaft appears charred by fire and pitted by acid. This staff allows the use of the following spells:<ul><li>Arcane sight (1 charge)</li><li>Channel the gift (1 charge)</li><li>Fractions of heal and harm (1 charge)</li><li>Spell gauge (1 charge)</li><li>Prying eyes (2 charges)</li><li>Spell scourge (3 charges)</li></ul>In addition, the wielder of the staff can store additional spells in the staff itself, similarly to a ring of spell storing. The staff of Nethys can contain up to 5 levels of spells (arcane, divine, or psychic, or even a mix of all three). The wielder doesn't need to spend charges to cast one of these stored spells from the staff, but must have levels in a class with that spell on its spell list.
