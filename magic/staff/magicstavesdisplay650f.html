Description

A creature that willingly grasps a zenj totem staff is affected as though it were in a zone of truth. This effect has no saving throw, lasts as long as the creature remains in contact with the staff, and can simultaneously affect as many creatures as can hold the staff at one time. This power is always on, and doesn't need to be activated.

The staff also acts as a normal magical staff and contains the following spells: <ul><li>Protection from evil (1 charge)</li><li>Summon nature's ally II (animals only, 2 charges)</li><li>Aura sight (3 charges)</li><li>Summon nature's ally IV (animals only, 4 charges)</li></ul> A shaman who wields the staff can cast summon nature's ally II and summon nature's ally IV from the staff even though those spells are not on her spell list. Additionally, once per day when a druid or shaman uses the staff to cast either of those spells, she can instead summon the creature to perform a single task for her with a duration of up to 1 hour per level. If summoned in this fashion, the summoned creature refuses to enter combat and is immediately dismissed if it takes damage from any source.
