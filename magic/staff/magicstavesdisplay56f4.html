Description

Angels crafted the first staff of wings to assist their mortal allies
during a fiendish invasion onto the Material Plane. Copies have
since been made by secular crafters. A staff of wings is made of
light birch and topped with a carved pair of angelic wings made
out of precious stone. This staff produces flight effects, and the
wielder gains translucent, illusory wings upon casting them.
Depending on the alignment and chosen patron of the creator,
these wings may appear draconic, feathery, or prismatic, or may
have other celestial features. The staff allows the use of the
following spells:
<ul><li>Fly (1 charge)
</li><li>Overland flight (2 charges)
</li><li>Mass fly (3 charges)</li></ul>
