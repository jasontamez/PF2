Description

These slender crystal shafts span 4 to 5 feet in length, with facets covered in deeply etched white runes of unknown make. Since the only known examples of these staves were discovered near Mount Dowama in the Mwangi Expanse, most scholars conjecture that they are relics of the Shory. The staff's holder is protected by a continuous feather fall effect. Additionally, the staff contains the following spells: <ul><li>Shocking grasp (1 charge)</li><li>Levitate (2 charges)</li><li>Fly (4 charges)</li></ul>

Construction

Requirements Craft Staff, fly, levitate, shocking grasp; Cost 10,800 gp
