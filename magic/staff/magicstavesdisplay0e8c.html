Description

This twisted and gnarled black oak staff draws upon the  formless magic of the Shadow Plane to allow use of the  following spells:<ul><li>major image (1 charge)</li><li>shadow conjuration (2 charges)</li><li>shadow evocation (3 charges)</li></ul>In addition, the staff can further influence shadow  conjuration and shadow evocation spells, whether cast from  the staff or the wielder's daily allotment of spells, without  increasing the spell's level. By expending extra charges,  the wielder can increase the shadowy substance used to  form such spells by +10% per charge, up to a maximum of  +50%. Using the staff for this purpose does not increase the  casting time of these spells.
