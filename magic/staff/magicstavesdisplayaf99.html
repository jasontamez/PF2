Description

A staff of stoneweaving is a staff of rough-hewn obsidian with a glowing ruby floating between the forked branches of its top end. It allows the use of the following spells:<ul><li>Spike stones (1 charge)</li><li>Statue (2 charges)</li><li>Stone shape (1 charge)</li><li>Stone to flesh (2 charges)</li><li>Stoneskin (2 charges)</li></ul>Additionally, the staff of stoneweaving acts as a +1 halfling sling-staff. The staff creates its own ammunition-ruby sling bullets which disappear after striking or missing their target. These bullets are created by tapping the head of the staff against the ground (a move action). The user cannot pick up bullets after firing them or otherwise harvest them; at the end of the round after a bullet is created, it disappears from existence.
