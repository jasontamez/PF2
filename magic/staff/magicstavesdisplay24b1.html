Description

This staff is made of a single icicle that
tapers to a sharpened point at each end. It
can be used as a +3 icy burst quarterstaff
(only one end of the staff bears this
magical enhancement), even if all of its
charges are drained. It allows the use of
the following spells and abilities:
<ul><li>Frostbite (1 charge)
</li><li>Ice storm (1 charge)
</li><li>Freezing sphere (2 charges)
</li><li>Icy prison (2 charges)
</li><li>Wall of ice (2 charges)
</li><li>Cone of cold (3 charges)
</li><li>Ice body (3 charges)</li></ul>
Like a frost brand, Winter's Reach extinguishes all nonmagical
fires in a 20-foot radius. As a standard action, it can also dispel
lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects. The bearer
must succeed at a dispel check (1d20+19) against each spell to
dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of
the fire spell. The staff can also be used to counterspell any spell
with the fire descriptor as if with dispel magic. Dispelling or
counterspelling a fire spell in this way uses 1 charge.
