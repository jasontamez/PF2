Description

Thin golden strands snake through this transparent shaft, seeming to flow from one brass end-cap to the other. Once per day when the wielder is damaged by an effect that deals at least 10 points of electricity damage, the staff regains 1 charge. This does not reduce the amount of damage the wielder takes from the effect. <ul><li>Shocking grasp (1 charge)</li><li>Intensified shocking grasp (2 charges)</li><li>Lightning bolt (5 charges)</li></ul>
