Description

The antennae on this mask of the mantis (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 298) have been truncated. Bloody Mantis has three charges per day, which replenish automatically every 24 hours. Each charge grants the wearer two of the following abilities for 30 minutes: darkvision to a range of 60 feet, the effects of see invisibility, the effects of deathwatch, or a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks. Additionally, three times per day the wearer can also use disguise self, although he always retains the mask's nublike antennae and must cover them with her hair or a hood to conceal them. Finally, if the wearer strikes a target with a melee attack during a surprise round, the target can't speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round.

Bloody Mantis contains the spirit of a haughty assassin lord, and has the special purpose of slaying insurrectionists, traitors, and other challengers to rightful monarchs. Bloody Mantis can use geas/quest once per day, but it rarely does so at the behest of its wearer. Instead, the mask targets its wearer with the effect whenever it dominates the wearer in a personality conflict, tasking the wearer to assassinate a target appropriate for its special purpose. So long as the wearer pursues this goal, Bloody Mantis uses its abilities to aid the wearer. The mask can spend its charges to improve its own senses rather than the wearer's, and is likely to waste charges in this way if its wearer resists its will.
