Description

This folding boat is made of rich, dark wood and a sail of blood-red cloth. In its ship form, it is the size of a longship, with 20 sets of oars and manacles to keep slave rowers in place. When in ship form, the Bloodwind can create a gust of powerful wind behind its sails as from a feather token (fan). This ability lasts for only 1 hour, and can be used once each day. The Bloodwind's special purpose is to serve the moon-beasts of Leng as a slave ship. When called by the moon-beasts' eerie piping, which the Bloodwind can hear from anywhere in the Dreamlands, it can sail through the air as with overland flight to the Dreamlands' mysterious moon.

The Bloodwind has a sly and spiteful intelligence and is fond of cruel pranks. It has sufficient self-mobility to operate its own sails, lock and unlock its own manacles, and trigger its powers, although it cannot operate all of its oars at once and therefore requires rowers to move when the wind is slack. The Bloodwind willingly follows the commands of moon-beasts and denizens of Leng, but plays cruel jokes on others, both slaves and slavers alike: untying knots, raising its anchor at inconvenient times, or even folding into a box and obstinately refusing to return to ship form. The Bloodwind's favorite prank is to surreptitiously unlock a new slave's manacles to offer the hope of freedom, and then snap them shut again-preferably bloodying a finger or toe in the process.
