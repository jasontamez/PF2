Description

These rings of protection +3 are extremely varied in
form. They can be of any alignment and each has its own
unique personality and proclivities. Each ring has a specific
obsession. To determine a particular obsession ring's
obsession, roll on Table 6-10: Intelligent Item Purpose. When
the ring is in pursuit of its purpose, its Ego is 10 points
higher than normal.

Gnomes with the obsession racial trait have a unique
understanding of the ring's mentality and gain a +5
bonus on Will saving throws to resist the obsession ring's
attempts to dominate the wearer.

When an obsession ring is engaged in action directly
related to its obsession, it grants its wearer the following
powers, but can choose to withhold such powers if it does
not believe their uses would further its obsession.
<ul><li>The ring functions as a ring of protection +5.
</li><li>The ring grants its wearer a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls
against creatures its obsession is sworn to defeat.
</li><li>Three times per day, the ring can allow its wearer to reroll
any saving throw. The wearer gains a +4 luck bonus on the
saving throw reroll.</li></ul>
These rings are typically quite emphatic on their desire to
fulfill their obsessions, and frequently communicate with their
wielder to encourage pursuit of this goal.
