rod can take may useful forms, and after 24 hours in the
possession of a lawful good creature, the wielder can
command it to take the form of any tool, including a
chime of opening. Very intelligent and witty, these rods
communicate with their wielders in truespeech (Bestiary
310; see archon subtype) or Celestial. Furthermore, the rod
has the following powers.

dimension door, as the spell.

energy that deals 2d6 points of force damage to creatures adjacent to the wielder. A successful DC 12 Reflex save halves
the damage. The wielder can choose to omit any target from
this blast that it desires, damaging only the foes it chooses.</li></ul>
