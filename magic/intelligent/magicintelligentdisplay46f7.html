Description

This +2 keen dancing longsword is infused with the soul of
a bard who chose to instill his consciousness into a weapon
rather than to see his voice die. The sword constantly sings.
The only way to silence it to a whisper is with a DC 15
Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and even this only quiets the
sword for 10 minutes plus another 10 minutes for every 5
points by which the DC is exceeded. The sword speaks, though
it typically communicates through song. A singing sword has
the following powers.
<ul><li>For 22 rounds per day, a singing sword can use bardic
performance, but can only use the countersong,
distraction, fascinate, inspire courage, or inspire
competence abilities. The sword is treated as an 8thlevel
bard for the purposes of these abilities.
</li><li>Three times per day, the singing sword can use the
heroic finale spell (Advanced Playerâ€™s Guide).</li></ul>

Construction

Craft Arms and Armor, keen edge, animate object, the soul of
