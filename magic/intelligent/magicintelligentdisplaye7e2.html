Description

This rod is a fusion of magic and the limb of a dangerous,
nearly mindless aberration. This rod features a single
writhing tentacle at one end. The rod contains the mind
of a living creature, but it does not have the ability to
communicate via speech, empathy, or telepathy. If allowed,
the rod attempts to attack creatures within reach, and must
be stowed in a bag or backpack when the wielder is sleeping
to keep it from grasping at the wielder or other creatures.

On command, the tentacle attacks an adjacent creature as
a melee touch attack (attack bonus +8). On a successful hit, the tentacle deals 2d8 points of acid damage and the target
must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be paralyzed
for 1 round. This paralysis is a mind-affecting fear effect.

The greater version of this rod has four tentacles, which
attack the same target simultaneously on command (attack
bonus +12). The tentacles collectively deal 4d8 points of acid
damage and the target must succeed at a DC 18 Will saving
throw or be paralyzed for 1 round. This paralysis is a mindaffecting
fear effect. The greater rods have a dedicated
purpose: serve a bloodthirsty master.
