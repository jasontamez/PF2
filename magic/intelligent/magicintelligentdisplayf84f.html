Description

This special +3 bane warhammer seeks only to crush the
enemy of its wielder in battle. The hammer can speak
Common, constantly mutters, curses when it is not engaged
in battle, and sings deeply of its love of carnage when it is
being used in a fight. The hammer of enemies is always eager
to point out potential enemies within its vision. Because of its
bloodlust it does not bestow negative levels on creatures that
do not share its alignment-it is willing to fight for anyone.
Additionally, three times per day, the hammer of enemies can
change the creature type of its bane ability. A creature type
remains until a new one is chosen.
