Description

This +2 aberration-bane bastard sword is made of magically hardened bronze and has the special purpose of killing aberrations and creatures intrinsically tied to Xhamen-Dor (including seeded undead and the dormant Star Seed). Upianshe's spirit can sense such foes within 60 feet, her bane enchantment applies to them, and against them her critical hit multiplier increases to ??3. Finally, she can attempt Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks as though she had 5 ranks in the skill (total +13 bonus).

Construction

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, detect aberration, summon monster I; Price 24,435 gp
