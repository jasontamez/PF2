Description

This golden gem-studded helmet acts like a crown of
conquest and grants its wielder three performance or
teamwork feats. The wearer can use each of these feats as
if it were on his feat list. Once chosen, at the time of the
item’s creation, these feats cannot be changed. The helmet
must be worn for 24 hours in order to gain the teamwork or
performance feats.

Furthermore this helmet can speak through a central
ruby that sits over the nose guard of the helmet. It knows
Common and four other languages. These helmets are always
confident-even arrogant-and give a running commentary
of the battle, praising heroism, chiding tactical missteps,
and giving its wearer and its allies martial advice. It has the
following other powers.
<ul><li>Three times per day, it can affect its wearer or an ally within
30 feet as the true strike spell.
</li><li>Three times per day, it can attempt to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a free action, as if using the
