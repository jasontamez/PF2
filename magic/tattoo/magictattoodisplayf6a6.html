Description

A watchtower tattoo must be applied to the back of a hand. Once applied, it provides a +4 resistance bonus against the spells and spell-like abilities of daemons, and the bearer cannot be possessed by daemons using magic jar or similar effects.

Daemons immediately recognize any bearer of this tattoo as an enemy, even if the mark is covered or disguised. This revulsion may trigger strange reactions in daemonic magic or artifacts.
