Description

This shadowy tattoo is drawn in a spiraling pattern down one of the bearer's arms. If the tattoo is visible, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks.

Whenever the bearer uses the hypnotism occult skill unlock, casts an enchantment spell that targets a single creature, or uses the hypnotic stare class feature, her target takes a -1 penalty on Will saving throws for the ability's duration and the DC to affect the target with the hypnotism occult skill unlock is reduced by 1. This is a mind-affecting effect.
