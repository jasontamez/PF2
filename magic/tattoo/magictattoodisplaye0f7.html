Description

This arabesque tattoo accentuates the bearer's movements. If the tattoo is visible, the bearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (dance) checks.

When the bearer uses a Perform skill or bardic performance, she can choose a creature within 90 feet that she can see and that can see her hypnotic tattoo. That creature takes a -2 penalty on Perception and Sense Motive checks while the bearer performs. This is a mind-affecting effect. The bearer can change the target of this effect as a free action on her turn.
