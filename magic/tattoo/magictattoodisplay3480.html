Description

This tattoo typically takes the form of a coiled snake, and once per day the bearer can activate it as a standard action. A viper tattoo must be visible to the bearer and must be touched as part of its activation. The tattoo is not normally placed on the head, neck, or back as a result, since most creatures would require mirrors to activate them.

When activated, the snake tattoo animates and becomes a viper (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 133). It appears in the bearer's space and acts immediately, on the bearer's turn, and obeys the bearer's spoken commands for up to 5 rounds.

The viper uses the bearer's base attack bonus when it attacks, and the DC to resist and cure its poison is equal to 10 + the 1/2 bearer's level + the bearer's Constitution modifier. If the bearer has a class feature or an ability that grants it precision damage (such as sneak attack), the viper's attack deals 1 additional point of damage per die of that precision damage.

At the end of the 5 rounds, the viper vanishes and reverts to its tattoo form. If the viper is killed, the tattoo vanishes. As a swift action, the bearer can command the viper to withdraw from an opponent, and in this case, the viper returns to its tattoo form once it reaches the bearer's space.
