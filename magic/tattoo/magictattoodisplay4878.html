Description

This sinuous tattoo appears to move when the bearer flexes his muscles. Three times per day when the bearer makes a successful melee attack with a monk or performance weapon or an unarmed strike, he can cause the tattoo to lunge like a snake at the creature hit. This allows the bearer to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
