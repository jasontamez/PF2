Description

An animal totem tattoo is dedicated to a specific animal totem. The bearer gains the totem transformation ability of a 5th-level druid with the corresponding animal shaman archetype (ape, bat, bear, boar, dragon, eagle, lion, saurian, serpent, shark, or wolf). If the bearer already has the corresponding totem transformation as a class ability, she is instead treated as a druid of 5 levels higher for the purposes of this ability.
