Description

These thick green vines grow leaves sparingly. When fully mature, they fill an area 20 feet square to a height of 5 feet. Any creature moving through the area must attempt a DC 15 Strength check in the first square they try to leave within the area. Failure means that the creature cannot move any farther that round. Success allows a creature to move as if in difficult terrain, while success by 5 or more allows a creature to move normally.

Grabbing vines have a 13-week growing season, though the season depends on when the vines were first cultivated; the grabbing vines return for 13 weeks during the same season each year.
