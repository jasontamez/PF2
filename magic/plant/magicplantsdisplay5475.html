Description

This large tree bears both vibrant red and dull yellow apples. The imbiber of a red apple gains a +5 insight bonus on her next Knowledge check. Consuming a yellow apple grants a single use of augury. The effects of an apple wear off after 24 hours, whether or not its abilities have been used.

A tree of knowledge produces one red apple per day and one yellow apple per week during its growing season, which lasts for 13 weeks in the spring. The tree has no more than seven red apples and one yellow apple at any given time.
