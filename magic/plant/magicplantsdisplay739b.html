Description

This vibrant red bush grows luscious, deep-red berries. These berries provide nourishment and healing as if the creature had consumed a berry affected by goodberry. A creature can gain the effects of goodberry up to eight berries consumed per day. A creature that eats more than this number must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or become sickened for 10 minutes.

A goodberry bush produces up to six berries per day, and it grows year round. A bush has no more than 50 berries at a time. It is resilient enough to grow in most environments, even occasionally found clinging to otherwise lifeless cliff faces.
