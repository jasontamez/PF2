Description

When packed tightly within the mouth of a corpse or undead creature, the deep red petals of the gravebane flower prevent any decay, as if the corpse were under the effects of <a href="spelldisplay506b.html?ItemName=gentle%20repose">gentle repose</a>, and they completely mask any stench with a sickly sweet fragrance. These effects persist for 1 month.

A single bush grows one new flower each day, and it takes 1 month to accumulate enough gravebane petals to preserve a single corpse. The plant has a 52-week growing period.
