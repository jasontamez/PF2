Description

This tree's papery bark flakes off in strips. When a creature consumes a piece of the bark, it reduces the amount of sleep it needs that night by 2 hours (to a minimum of 6 hours). If the creature consumes additional pieces of bark, it is sickened for 8 hours and gains no additional benefit.

The bark's potency is increased if it's brewed into a tea. A piece of bark brewed into a tea reduces the amount of sleep the imbiber needs by 4 hours (to a minimum of 4 hours). The tea of the restful birch is considerably safer than consuming the bark raw-multiple doses grant no additional benefit but also cause no penalties.

A restful birch can have enough bark safely removed each day for up to four creatures to eat or drink. For each additional piece of bark removed after the fourth, there is a cumulative 5% chance that the tree dies, falling and rotting away within the next 24 hours. Restful birches grow year round.
