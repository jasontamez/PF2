Description

This broad-stalked shrub branches into dozens of oversized dandelion flowers. A Small or smaller creature weighing less than 50 pounds can use a flower as a move action to slow her fall to a rate of 10 feet per round. While she is so slowed, the flower also carries her in the direction of the wind. Light winds carry her 10 feet, moderate winds carry her 20 feet, strong winds carry her 50 feet, and severe winds carry her 100 feet (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). If a flower is exposed to winds of windstorm strength or greater, all of its seeds immediately blow away and the dandelion provides no further benefit. The benefits also end after 4 minutes or once the bearer hits the ground, whichever comes first.

The plant produces one dandelion every day during its 13-week growing period during the spring, to a maximum of 20 dandelions at any one time. Unlike many magical plants, the fluffy blooms of the breezeblown dandelion remain potent until used.
