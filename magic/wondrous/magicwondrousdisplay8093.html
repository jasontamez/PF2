Description

When rubbed vigorously into the skin, this potent red liniment
enhances a Tiny or smaller creature's ability to make full use of
its size and mobility. Applying a dose of liniment is a standard
action that provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to applying
an oil). A creature under the effects of the liniment no longer
provokes attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened
squares or for entering a larger creature's square. The balm lasts
for 5 minutes before its effects wear off. A newly created bottle
of balm holds 5 doses.
