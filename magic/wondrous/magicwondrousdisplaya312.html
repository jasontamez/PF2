Description

Creatures viewed through these
darkly tinted glasses sometimes
seem to flicker briefly in and out of
existence. A transmuter can use these
spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard
transmutation spell into any other wizard transmutation
spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level
or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may use
the spectacles to spontaneously cast disintegrate in place
of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells of 6th
level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.
