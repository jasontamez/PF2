Description

This tiny glass bead transforms itself into a small (2-foot-tall) pile
of burning logs whenever its command word is spoken. The fire
burns for 8 hours or until extinguished, at which point it turns
back into a bead. The owner of the item must wait twice as long
as the fire burned before he can order the bead to become a
campfire again.
