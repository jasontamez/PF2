Description

This device looks like a clear, fist-sized crystal with an internal lattice made up of nearly invisible strands of silver-white metal. By holding the crystal in both hands and concentrating, the user can record its own memories, storing the information in the crystal so that it can be retrieved later with perfect clarity. The crystal can store a nearly limitless amount of information, but the user must concentrate for 1 minute to record an amount of information that would require 10 minutes to communicate in other ways.

The information in a mnemonic repository can be recalled in a similar fashion, requiring 1 minute of concentration for each 10 minutes' worth of information gained, but the user must know the repository's mental keyword, which is set by the creature that recorded the memories. A mnemonic repository can be used to remove the effects of spells such as modify memory or repress memory, as long as the user recorded its true memories prior to being affected by those spells, but the device cannot remove negative levels imposed by a mindwipe spell, nor can it restore previously cast spells.
