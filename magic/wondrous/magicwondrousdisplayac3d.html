Description

A wind fan appears to be nothing
more than a wood and papyrus or
cloth instrument with which to create
a cooling breeze. By uttering the
command word, its possessor causes
the fan to duplicate a gust of wind spell.
The fan can be used once per day with
no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative
chance per usage during that day that the device tears into
useless, nonmagical tatters.
