Description

This stone grants you a benefit when you're dying. When determining the number of negative hit points you must accrue to die, treat your Constitution score as if it were 2 higher. This doesn't provide a bonus to Constitution, so it doesn't grant a bonus on checks to stabilize, but it does provide you 2 additional rounds in which you can attempt such checks. You can benefit from only one tourmaline sphere ioun stone at a time.

Resonance

This stone grants a +1 bonus on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying.
