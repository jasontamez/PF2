Description

This long, double-breasted jacket is sewn from durable, dun-colored
canvas with a removable liner to keep its wearer comfortable in
a wide range of temperatures. Anyone wearing the coat notes
many small cloth patches of various shapes. Only the wearer of
the robe can see these patches, recognize them for the items they
become, and detach them. One patch can be detached each round.
Detaching a patch causes it to become an actual item, as indicated
below. A Pathfinder greatcoat has each of the following patches
(unless noted otherwise, the coat has only one of each patch):
<ul><li>10 days of trail rations and five full waterskins
