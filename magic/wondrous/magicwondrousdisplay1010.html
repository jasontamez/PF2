Description

Prized by evil warriors, these boots are made of inky black
leather trimmed with a crimson mane of fiendish horsehair.
Some bear the hair of actual nightmares along their rims, causing
them to occasionally flare and crackle with flames reminiscent
of the foul equines. When the wearer runs or charges, smoke
issues up from the boots, acting as concealment (20% miss
chance) when the wearer provokes attacks of opportunity
while making those actions. Secondly, three times per day, as
a swift action, the wearer can make the boots smoke, which
grants her concealment until the end of her turn. Lastly, once
per day, when the wearer hits a creature with a melee attack,
she can command the boots to ignite. When the boots ignite, all
creatures within a 5-foot radius take 2d6 points of fire damage.
A DC 13 Reflex saving throw halves the damage.
