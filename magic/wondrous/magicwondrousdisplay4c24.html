Description

Studded with shards of inert soul gems, this bridle imbues its wearer with a fraction of the power of the Pale Horse, the Horseman of Death's steed. Once per day as an immediate action, the rider of a creature wearing this item can activate it as part of the mount's movement. It becomes incorporeal during its movement, though it must stop in an unoccupied space. Any object the creature passes through during its incorporeal movement begins to crumble, having its hit points reduced by half (ignoring hardness). Any living creatures' spaces the mount passes through during its incorporeal movement feel the cold wind of death and must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores that lasts for 1 minute.
