Description

Spikebones are a collection of bleached humanoid bones' typically the ribs, vertebrae, and finger bones-carried in a crude pouch made of the humanoid's skin and connective tissue. Three times per day, the spikebones can be cast upon the ground as a standard action to create an area of dangerous spikes. Bony in color and shape, these sharp protrusions function like a spike growth spell. The spikes fill four contiguous 10-foot-square areas, shaped by the user at the time of deployment. The spikes remain effective for up to 3 hours, after which they vanish and the spikebones magically reappearing in their pouch.
