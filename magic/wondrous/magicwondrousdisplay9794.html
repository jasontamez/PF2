Description

This 12-inch-long scroll is scribed on papyrus that has been anointed with holy water. Written on the scroll's face in Minkaian are three to four pictographs that bid the reader a peaceful rest. A papyrus of eternal rest grants its owner a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet whenever she wields the item in one hand and clearly presents it before her. Haunts and incorporeal undead must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or take 1d6 points of damage and become sickened for 1 round. A successful Will save prevents the sickened condition and reduces the damage by half. Haunts can't avoid looking at a papyrus of eternal rest, but incorporeal undead can as normal.

The user of a papyrus of eternal rest cannot wield both a weapon and the papyrus in the same hand, and the hand presenting the papyrus cannot be used to complete the somatic components of spells. Because of the item's light weight, however, wielding a papyrus of eternal rest does not count as having an occupied hand for the purpose of the Fencing Grace, Slashing Grace, or Starry Grace feats, a swashbuckler's precise strike deed, and similar effects.
