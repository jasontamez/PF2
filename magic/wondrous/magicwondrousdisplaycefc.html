Description

This is the most common form of
scrying device, a crystal sphere about
6 inches in diameter. So well-known
are these items that many so-called
oracles or fortune-tellers use similar
appearing (but completely nonmagical)
replicas of these items to
ply their trades. A character can use a
magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into
other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16
negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but
the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.
Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used
through the crystal ball on the target viewed.

* The viewer is able to send and receive silent mental
messages with the person appearing in the crystal ball.
Once per day, the character may attempt to implant a
suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) as well.
