Description

The wearer of these elegant, polished steel pauldrons gains a bonus on all saving throws, as with a cloak of resistance, but the resistance bonus on Fortitude saves is one greater. Furthermore, if the wearer fails a Fortitude saving throw, he can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to reroll that saving throw. If the wearer fails the saving throw on the reroll, he can't use this ability again for 24 hours.
