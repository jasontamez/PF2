Description

The body of this wooden flute is elaborately decorated with carved motifs of horses running across grassy plains. Once per day, the user of a horse-caller flute can play a lilting melody with the flute, and while doing so can attempt a DC 10 Perform (wind) check. On a success, a light riding horse appears in an appropriate space adjacent to the player to serve as her mount for 2 hours, plus an additional 2 hours for every 5 points by which the result exceeds the Perform (wind) check DC. The horse does not appear if the terrain cannot support it; in this case, if the user succeeds at the Perform (wind) check, the horse simply does not appear and the item's daily use is not wasted.
