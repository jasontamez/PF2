Description

This black linen tunic has simple brass buttons. Once per day, the wielder can attune the garment to one ally by standing for 1 minute in a position in which both the wielder's and his ally's shadows overlap. For the next 24 hours, whenever the wielder is adjacent to that ally and that ally takes damage, the wielder can sacrifice up to 10 hit points to prevent an equal amount of damage done to the ally. This damage cannot be reduced or redirected, and if the wielder is incapable of sacrificing hit points, the damage to the ally cannot be prevented. If the vest is removed before its duration ends, the connection between the wielder and ally is lost and the vest is powerless until 24 hours have passed since its last attunement.
