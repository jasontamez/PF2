Description

This substance provides a +20 competence
bonus on all Escape Artist checks and
combat maneuver checks made to
escape from a grapple. The salve also
grants a +10 competence bonus to the
wearer's CMD for the purpose of avoiding
grapple attempts. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical
or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes
and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on
a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting
grease spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it
can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).


Salve of slipperiness is needed to coat the inside of a container
meant to hold sovereign glue.
