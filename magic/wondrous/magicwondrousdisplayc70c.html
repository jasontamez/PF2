Description

This glowing violet liquid is ice-cold regardless of the surrounding temperature. This elixir allows a character to bypass the cold immunity or cold resistance of creatures she attacks with her magic. For 6 rounds after drinking a truefrost elixir, a character's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that deal cold damage become supernaturally cold, and the damage caused by these effects is not subject to being reduced by a creature's cold resistance. Creatures with cold immunity take half damage from such attacks. Truefrost elixir has no effect on cold damage from weapons, on non-cold-based effects, or against creatures without immunity to cold or cold resistance.
