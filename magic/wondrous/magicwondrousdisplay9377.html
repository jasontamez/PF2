Description

This oddly shaped, transparent bottle has one chamber nested inside the other and two separate spouts, one leading into the smaller inner bottle, and the other into the outer bottle. To use the bottle, the inner chamber is filled with a potion and the outer chamber filled with water. When left alone for 24 hours, the water in the outer chamber slowly takes on the properties of the potion in the inner chamber, creating a second dose of the potion (though the bottle is unable to replicate potions with expensive material components). The second dose of created potion must be quaffed from the bountiful bottle to be effective, and loses its potency if transferred to another container. By expending one use of mythic power, the time it takes to transform a potion is shortened to a full-round action.
