Description

Each spell inscribed in this book becomes a greater glyph of
warding (DC 19, spell glyph) containing the spell recorded. When
an unauthorized person reads a spell, the glyph triggers against
him. This destroys the pages on which the spell is written, but
leaves the rest of the book unharmed. Pages containing harmless
spells or spells that can't be attached to a glyph are unaffected.
