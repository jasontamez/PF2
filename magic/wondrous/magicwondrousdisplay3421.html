Description

This vibrant cluster of leaves
constantly changes hue through the
different colors of the autumn season,
from brown and red to orange and
yellow. Once per day, the bearer may
touch the leaves to her tongue to
assume tree shape (as the spell) for
up to 8 hours, appearing as a healthy tree that is lush with
thousands of autumn leaves for the duration of the effect.


While in tree form, a creature may release these leaves
upon the wind, consciously controlling them as a scrying
sensor with the abilities of arcane eye. The leaves have the
statistics of an army ant swarm, except the swarm has plant
traits, fast healing 5, and vulnerability to fire.


The creature may shape the scrying leaves into a
semblance of her face, allowing her to speak through the
leaves. The leaves' voice is a quiet, dry rustle, and they
are capable of conveying most of the creature's intended
facial expressions (they can smile, frown, and so on). If the
creature has the wild empathy class ability or is a sorcerer
with the fey bloodline, she may have any ghost sound,
speak with animals, or speak with plants spell she casts
originate from the leaves instead of herself, and her tree
shape does not prevent her from casting these spells.


If the scrying leaves fail to return before creature returns
to its normal shape, the magic item does not function for 1
week. During this time, the leaves fade to brown and appear
to have a light coating of frost on them.
