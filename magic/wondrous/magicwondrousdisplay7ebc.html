Description

These ruddy leather gloves enhance the precision of the wearer. When wielding a piercing or slashing weapon and using Weapon Finesse, the wearer can mark a creature when confirming a critical hit instead of dealing additional damage. The mark consists of a simple symbol, such as a single letter.

The wielder and her allies gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against the marked creature for 1 minute. In addition, the marked creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + one-half the wielder's level + the wielder's Dexterity modifier) or be shaken for 1 minute. The bonuses and condition persist even if the damage caused by the mark is healed.
