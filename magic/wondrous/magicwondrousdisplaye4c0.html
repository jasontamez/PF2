Description

Silver circles and conjuring runes decorate this black robe.
Three times per day when the wearer uses a summoning spell
or spell-like ability to summon a variable number of creatures,
he can choose to summon the maximum number of creatures
possible. Creatures summoned in this way step from the
shadowy folds of the robe, and appear adjacent to the wearer.
If there isn't sufficient room for all the creatures to appear, the
extra creatures are wasted and do not appear.


If the wearer is a summoner, he can call upon the robe
to summon his eidolon as a standard action once per day. It
must appear adjacent to the summoner when called this way.
