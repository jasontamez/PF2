Description

A talisman of pure faith looks like a set of six of black and red hexagons nested within each other. When worn about the neck, a talisman of pure faith physically transforms into a holy symbol that matches the faith of the wearer, unless that information is blocked via a magical effect. It can be utilized as a divine focus, and doesn't take up a neck slot when worn in this manner. If worn by someone who doesn't worship a single deity, it remains in its hexagonal shape and cannot be used as a divine focus. As long as it is carried or worn, a talisman of pure faith functions as a phylactery of faithfulness. In addition, while it is worn, the talisman grants a +4 bonus on all concentration checks to cast spells impeded by planar traits.
