Description

This magic instrument comes in
four varieties. Each appears to be
a normal, scarred old horn used
for hunting or signaling during
battle. When someone speaks
its command word and blows
the horn, however, the horn summons a number of human
barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them.
Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and
refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The
horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and
what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character
who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite
is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.


Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people
(though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting
equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of
the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents
are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.
