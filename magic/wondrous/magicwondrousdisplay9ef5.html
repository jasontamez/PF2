Description

These 10 ebony, pearl, and ivory tiles, when arranged in a spiral pattern on the ground, provide you with the effects of a guidance spell once per day. The spell's effect lasts until discharged.

If your patron is Pharasma, you can toss the spiral tiles upon the ground once per day as a standard action and interpret the patterns they lie in as if you had cast augury. If Pharasma is not your patron and you attempt to use spiral tiles in this manner, the result is either random or purposefully misleading.
