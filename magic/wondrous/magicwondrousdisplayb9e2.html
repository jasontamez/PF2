Description

Each of these 3-foot-long branding irons ends in a distinctive, cruel-looking symbol. Once per day on command, a wielder of a conquering brand can cause the tip to grow red hot for 1 hour, and during this time one creature can be branded. The brand's recipient is burned as normal for a branding iron (see page 63) and is also affected as per brand (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 207) or another spell the conquering brand carries, as the wielder of the brand chooses. A conquering brand can create only one magical brand per day.

Conformity: A conquering brand of conformity can create a brand of conformity. Faint transmutation; CL 1st; Craft Wondrous Item, brand, brand of conformity.

Geas: A conquering brand of geas can affect the recipient as per geas/quest. When the brand is used in this way, it takes 10 minutes for its tip to heat up. If not used to create a brand, the mark left by the branding iron is nonmagical and not tied to the spell effect, so removing it doesn't remove the spell effect. Moderate enchantment; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, brand, geas/quest.

Hobbling: A conquering brand of hobbling can create a brand of hobbling. Faint transmutation; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, brand, brand of hobbling.

Justice: A conquering brand of justice can create a mark of justice, as per the spell. When the brand is used this way, it takes 10 minutes for its tip to heat up. Faint necromancy; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, brand, mark of justice.

Lesser Geas: A conquering brand of lesser geas allows you to affect the recipient as per lesser geas. When the brand is used in this way, it takes 1 round for its tip to heat up. If not used to create a brand, the mark left by the branding iron is nonmagical and not tied to the spell effect, so removing it doesn't remove the spell effect. Faint enchantment; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, brand, lesser geas.

Subjugation: This brand can create a greater brand (Advanced Player's Guide 207), except it blazes when brought within 30 feet of the Nail's symbol.
