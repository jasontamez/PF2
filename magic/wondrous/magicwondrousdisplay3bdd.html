Description

This thimble-sized clay container of thick, moist face paint has
enough material to paint streaks and whorls of any color on one
creature's face. Once applied, the wearer can, as a swift action,
make the paint rearrange itself into a ghastly m??lange of colors,
making her appearance momentarily disturbing and hideous.
The wearer chooses one creature who can see her painted face
within 30 feet to be affected by cause fear (DC 11). Once the paint
is used in this fashion, it loses all magic and becomes normal face
paint. Once applied, the wearer has 24 hours to use the paint's
magic; otherwise it fades away.
