Description

This garment is typically black or dark
blue and embroidered with small
white or silver stars. The robe has three
magical powers.


It enables the wearer to travel
physically to the Astral Plane, at will and
on command as if using the plane shift
spell. Once he has done so, the wearer
can also return to his plane of origin on
command, also as per the plane shift spell.


This robe also grants its wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving
throws.


Finally, the wearer can use up to six of the embroidered stars
on the chest portion of the robe as +5 shuriken. The robe grants its
wearer proficiency with such weapons. Each shuriken disappears
after it is used. The stars are replenished once per month.
