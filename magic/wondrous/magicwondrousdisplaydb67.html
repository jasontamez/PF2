Description

A cauldron of brewing looks like a fine cooking pot with
four stout legs. The cauldron is capable of heating any liquid
placed in it to a precise temperature (anywhere from just
above room temperature to hot enough to boil salt water)
and maintaining it indefinitely while still remaining only
slightly warm to the touch on the outside. A cauldron of
brewing provides a +5 competence bonus on Craft (alchemy)
skill checks.
