Description

This thick, smooth leather collar is made from delicate but sturdy panels of calfskin and has a dainty green gem dangling from its center in an elaborate golden setting. The gem glows when poisons or toxins are within 10 feet of the wearer. Additionally, as a swift action after failing a saving throw against a poison, the wearer can pull the gem from the collar and crush it, which allows her to reroll the saving throw against the poison with a +2 competence bonus. The wearer must take the second roll, even if it is worse. Activating this ability destroys the collar.
