Description

This short aspergillum is made of silver. An inquisitor who
carries it may use detect undead as if it were one of the spells
associated with her detect alignment ability. Once per day, the
item can alter an inquisitor's judgment ability; by spending
one use of her judgment ability, she can allow her spells of
3rd level and lower to have full effect against incorporeal
creatures, as though using the Ectoplasmic Spell feat. This lasts
until the combat ends.
