Description

When the command word is spoken, this palm-sized stone teleports one Medium creature and up to 100 pounds of equipment to a specific elf gate (see page 27) that the stone is keyed to. Only one creature may travel this way per home stone. The stone crumbles when activated. Home stones were originally invented by the Lantern Bearers as a way to quickly escape the Darklands when raids went poorly, with a typical raiding party carrying only one such stone, allowing a lone survivor to return and report on the mission.
