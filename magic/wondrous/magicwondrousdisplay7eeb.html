Description

This jewel-like lens slowly changes colors over time, with no discernible pattern. It may appear as a ruby one morning and a sapphire that night, only to become opaline for the entire next day. Most owners set their rhombocrystal in a metal festoon on a chain and carry it as a pendant, monocle, or loupe. A rhombocrystal can be used as a magnifying glass, and grants its bearer a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks involving gems and crystals.

If Nivi Rhombodazzle is the bearer's patron, the bearer gains a +1 luck bonus on Reflex saving throws.
