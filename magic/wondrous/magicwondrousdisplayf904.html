Description

Upon a frail silver chain dangles a tiny crystalline phial filled with light blue dust. When one shatters the phial, it releases a potent flash of abjuration magic that affects all evocation and necromancy magic in a 30-foot-radius with a targeted dispel magic. Each phial holds one use of the dust and, once used, the item is destroyed. This phial can be used as a thrown weapon (PH 158).

While legends credit Runelord Belimarius with creating dust of envy, further historical accounts imply that the remaining runelords also uncovered the secrets of making their own virtue-related dusts - all of which activate under similar circumstances and produce similar effects, being attuned to a specific sin and targeting spells of the schools related to the two opposing sins.
