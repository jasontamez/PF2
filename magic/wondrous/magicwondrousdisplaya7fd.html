Description

This mottled gray cloak looks like granite or
some other light gray stone. The wearer can
pull a minor stone cloak tight around herself
and freeze in place as a move action, which
causes the cloak to harden like the stone it
resembles. When she does this, the wearer
can take no actions other than free actions
and is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC but
gains DR 5/adamantine. She also gains a
+5 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks while protected in this
manner. This effect can be dismissed as a free action.
