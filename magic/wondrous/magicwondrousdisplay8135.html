Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This simple, pale porcelain mask has large, circular eye-holes. Twice per day, the wearer can speak a command word and make a touch attack against a humanoid creature as a free action. If he hits, the mask alters the wearer's appearance to match the creature touched as per alter self. If the touch misses, the activation is wasted. Unlike a typical polymorph effect, the disguise is a good likeness of the specific individual and grants a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as that individual. The mask melds into the wearer's face, leaving only an extremely fine seam that can be noticed with a successful Perception check opposed by the user's Disguise check. The effect lasts until the wearer removes the mask or uses it to assume a new form.

If the wearer is a gillman, he can concentrate on one simple question that could be answered in 25 words or fewer when he activates the mask. If he does so, he learns what the target thinks is the question's answer when the touch attack hits, unless the target succeeds at a DC 17 Will saving throw.
