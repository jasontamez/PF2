Description

This gurgling, luminescent elixir comes in several different
varieties, each keyed to a particular type of metallic or
chromatic dragon. A creature that drinks the elixir can, as a
standard action, breathe out a single blast of energy similar
to a dragon's breath weapon, dealing 7d6 points of energy
damage. Creatures in the area may attempt a DC 16 Reflex
save for half damage. The magic of the elixir ends after
one use of the breath weapon or after 1 hour has passed,
whichever comes first. The type of energy produced and the
shape of the blast are determined by the elixir's associated
dragon type:


Black or copper dragon: 30-foot line of acid.
Blue or bronze dragon: 30-foot line of electricity.
Brass dragon: 30-foot line of fire.
Green dragon: 15-foot cone of acid.
Gold or red dragon: 15-foot cone of fire.
Silver or white dragon: 15-foot cone of cold.
