Description

This massive teak platform is designed to be strapped to the back of a Huge or larger quadruped like a saddle. The howdah of leisurely travel automatically resizes to fit a creature of Huge to Colossal size. It has room for four Medium creatures if mounted on a Huge creature, nine Medium creatures if mounted on a Gargantuan creature, and 16 Medium creatures if mounted on a Colossal creature. The howdah is constructed for ceremony rather than war, with upright bronze posts supporting a thin wooden roof and silk curtains; it does not provide cover to those riding within it, though the curtains provide concealment when closed.

A howdah of leisurely travel grants a constant endure elements effect to all creatures within and grants such creatures a +4 competence bonus on saves against disease, effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion, energy drain, and poisons. Within the howdah, natural healing takes place at twice the normal rate. The creature bearing the howdah does not gain these benefits.
