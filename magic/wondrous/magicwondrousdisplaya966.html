Description

An empty soul jar can be used to contain a soul that has been successfully trapped in a black sapphire via <a href="spelldisplayd114.html?ItemName=soul%20bind">soul bind</a>. Holding the gemstone against the soul jar's lid for 1 full round transfers the soul in the gem to the soul jar (which can hold the soul of a creature of up to 20 Hit Dice), leaving the black sapphire unharmed 50% of the time. The rest of the time, transferring the soul from gem to jar shatters the black sapphire. A creature that can use <a href="spelldisplayd114.html?ItemName=soul%20bind">soul bind</a> as a spell-like ability (and thus does not use a focus) can automatically place a captured soul in a held soul jar as the spell-like ability is used. A soul in a soul jar cannot travel to the Boneyard to be judged, but can be restored to life via <a href="spelldisplayd65d.html?ItemName=resurrection">resurrection</a> or more powerful magic. A soul jar can contain only one soul at a time. Soul jars are fragile (hardness 1, hp 10); if a soul jar is broken, the soul held within immediately escapes to the Boneyard.
