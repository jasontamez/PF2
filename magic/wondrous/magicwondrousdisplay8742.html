Description

This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork.
When taken to any airless environment, it retains air within
it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means
that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The
bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it
around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but
a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold
her breath.
