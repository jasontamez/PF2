Description

This small, weathered journal contains 10,000 jokes that change to be perfectly suited for particular audiences. The book grants its owner a +5 bonus on any Diplomacy check to influence the attitude of a creature. Additionally, up to three times per day the book can be used to cast hideous laughter (Will DC 13 negates).

By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, the book's reader can make a brutal verbal tirade mocking a creature. The target creature is enraged per the rage spell, and all other enemies within 30 feet of the target begin laughing uncontrollably, as hideous laughter (Will DC 14 negates either effect). The book contains only one perfect joke for any given creature, so attempting to use the book on a creature a second time yields no effect.
