Description

This globe of varicolored material constantly shifts hue and
texture, from steel-hard to spongy or even gelatinous. The bearer
of the orb is constantly protected by entropic shield. Three times
per day, when the bearer holds the orb and casts a spell with
the polymorph subtype, chaotic descriptor, or one that gives
creatures the confused condition, she may modify her caster
level for that spell by 1d6-2.


Once per day the bearer may hold the orb and command it to
dispel magic. If the dispel check succeeds, the wielder absorbs
the unraveled magical energy through the orb and gains the
benefit of an aid spell.


The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any lawful
creature holding or carrying it. The negative level remains as long
as the creature has the orb and disappears immediately when
the orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be
overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the
bearer has the orb.
