Description

This warm outfit consists of a woolen coat and pants, boots, gloves, and a heavy fur cloak with a leather hood. The habit of the winter explorer provides a constant endure elements effect in cold weather (it has no effect in warm weather), and the wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against magic cold effects and spells with the cold descriptor.

When the hood of the habit is drawn up around the head, the wearer's eyes turn a piercing sky blue color. The wearer becomes immune to snow blindness and gains the ability to see through natural or magical fog, sleet, snow, and other similar weather conditions with a range of 60 feet.

The habit of the winter explorer also grants its wearer a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks made in cold weather (temperatures below 40 F). In addition, once per day in cold weather, the wearer may turn invisible for 3 rounds as the vanish spell (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 253).

All pieces of the habit of the winter explorer must be worn for the item to function.
