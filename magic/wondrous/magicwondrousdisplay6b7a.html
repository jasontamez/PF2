Description

This green glass bottle has a tiny winding key on its elongated
stem that, if turned, causes a shadowy cork to slowly become
substantial over a 1-round period. Anything the owner of the
bottle speaks into the bottle during this time (up to 25 words)
gets trapped inside it once the cork fully manifests. As soon as
the cork is removed or the bottle is smashed, this message is
released exactly as if the owner had spoken the words at that
moment. Once the bottle releases its message, it shatters.
