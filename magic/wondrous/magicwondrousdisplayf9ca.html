Description

Finely laid gold filigree lines these ornately worked talons.
Once donned, the talons of Leng grant the wearer a natural
claw attack with each hand that deal 1d4 points of damage
for a Medium wearer, or 1d3 points of damage for a Small
wearer. These claw attacks have a +3 enhancement bonus
on attack and damage rolls. On a critical hit, the target must
succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become permanently confused
as per the insanity spell. This is a mind-affecting effect.


The wearer of the talons of Leng is immune to effects that
grant the confused condition. For as long as she wears the
talons, however, her Wisdom is reduced by 2, as alien voices
constantly whisper through her head. The talons of Leng do
not interfere with spellcasting, the use of handheld items, or
wielding weapons.
