Description

The claw can be attached in place of the missing arm of any Medium humanoid to function as a replacement arm. This requires an hour-long installation surgery that must be performed by a character with 8 ranks in both Craft (clockwork) and Heal. The recipient must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save for the arm to properly attach, and takes 2 points of Constitution damage from the surgery in any case. If the arm is properly attached, the recipient can lift up to 1-1/2 his maximum load over his head, and gains a claw attack as a secondary attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (if nothing is held in that arm).
