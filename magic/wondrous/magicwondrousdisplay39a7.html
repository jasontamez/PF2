Description

This bookmark alters the book that holds it so that it appears
to be another book entirely, even upon a thorough reading. The
apparent book is determined when the bookmark is crafted, and
is usually an especially boring or commonplace book such as a
legal or religious text. The bookmark also protects itself and the
book with nondetection.
