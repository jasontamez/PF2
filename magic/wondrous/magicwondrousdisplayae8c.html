Description

Appearing to be a finely crafted bridle of polished steel and blue-dyed leather, a bridle of tricks can be placed on any animal or magical beast with an appropriate shape to wear a bridle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with GM discretion). While wearing the bridle, a creature is treated as knowing three, four, or five additional tricks, as if it had been taught the tricks with the Handle Animal skill. The tricks granted by a bridle of tricks are set when it is created, and cannot be changed. The most common tricks found in a bridle of tricks are attack, defend, fetch, guard, and heel. See the Handle Animal description on page 97 of the Core Rulebook for more information on tricks, and Pathfinder Player Companion: Animal Archive for new additional tricks.
