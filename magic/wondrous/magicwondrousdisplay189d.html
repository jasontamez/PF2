Description

This tiny silver cube is activated by throwing it at an intersection
of squares within 50 feet. The cube hovers 5 feet above the
ground at that location for the next 5 rounds. Any small
projectile or thrown weapon (such as arrows, shuriken, vials,
and bullets) that passes through the squares adjacent to the
cube automatically turn in midair to hit the cube (no attack
roll needed) instead of their intended target. The cube has 5
hit points and hardness 8. If the arrow magnet is touched by a
creature or reduced to 0 hit points or less, it falls to the ground
and is destroyed.
