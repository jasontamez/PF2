Description

This white silk cloak shimmers with divine energy. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of a cloak of heavenly fire can cause it to flash with flames as another creature touches the wearer or strikes the wearer with a melee attack. These flames deal 1d8+5 points of fire damage to the creature that touched the wearer. If the creature subjected to this damage is evil, it takes an additional 1d8+5 points of damage as the fire glows with golden light-this additional damage is divine in nature and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. A target that succeeds at a DC 15 Reflex save takes half the total damage. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of a cloak of heavenly fire can also use the magic to cure wounds, restoring 2d8+5 hit points to a touched creature.
