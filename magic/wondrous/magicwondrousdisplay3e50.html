Description

These heavy, stone gloves feel surprisingly supple to anyone who puts them on. While a creature wears stonefist gloves, his unarmed strike damage is treated as if he were one size category larger, and bypasses hardness of 8 or lower. When a mythic creature uses these gloves to make a sunder combat maneuver, he adds half his tier as a bonus on the combat maneuver check.
