Description

These tattered and ragged garments extend the duration of a shifter's bestial transformations, allowing her to shift into her aspects' minor forms for 5 additional minutes per day. Each set of bestial rags is also tied to a specific aspect, typically being made of the hide of that creature and embossed with crude pictograms of it, allowing a shifter to assume that aspect's minor and major form, as appropriate for her level. If the shifter already has the ability to shift into that form, that aspect's major form functions as if she were 2 levels higher.
