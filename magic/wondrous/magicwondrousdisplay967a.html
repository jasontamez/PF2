Description

A folding boat looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches
long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive.
In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other
box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box
unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a
boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second
command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship
24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat
cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy
once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now
rest inside the boat or ship.


In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor,
a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck,
single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a
deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four
people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.


A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold
itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.
