Description

This hollowed-out horn comes in
four varieties: a horn of plentiful
goods, a horn of plentiful labor, a
horn of plentiful influence, and a
horn of plentiful magic. Each variety
carries the same construction
requirements but offers a different benefit. The horn's type
must be determined at creation and cannot later be changed.
If the horn is random, roll a d4 to determine which type of
horn it is.

A horn of plenty may be blown once per week of downtime
to improve the rate at which its bearer can exchange capital.
On command, a horn of plentiful goods, labor, or influence
allows a creature to trade any 2 points of a single type of
capital in exchange for 1 point of either Goods, Labor, or
Influence, as indicated by the item's name. (For instance, a
horn of plentiful goods allows a creature to trade 2 points of
any one kind of capital for 1 point of Goods.) This effect lasts
for 1 day. If you are already trading two single types of capital
for one other type of capital, at the GM's discretion, blowing
the horn allows you to trade on a 1-to-1 basis.

A horn of plentiful magic acts similarly to the aforementioned
horns, but instead allows a character to trade 3 points of either
Goods, Labor, or Influence for 1 point of Magic.
