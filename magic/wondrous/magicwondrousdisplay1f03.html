Description

This grapefruit-sized sphere of glossy black stone glows with
faint whorls of orange fire deep within its inky substance.
When held in hand, it can be commanded to unleash a
dread bolt once per day. When used as an additional focus
for casting a spell with the evil descriptor, the bearer gains
a +1 bonus to her caster level for these spells. It bestows
one permanent negative level on any good creature holding
or carrying it. The negative level remains as long as the
creature has the orb and disappears immediately when the
orb is no longer held or carried. This negative level cannot be
overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while
the bearer has the orb.
