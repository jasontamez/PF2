Description

This heavy book contains a collection of epic tales of mighty Ulfen heroes and the wondrous deeds they performed-and entwined within the words is a powerful magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of 48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, she gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks and a +4 morale bonus on saves against fear. This is a permanent magical effect that can be dispelled as normal. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the pages and it becomes a normal book.
