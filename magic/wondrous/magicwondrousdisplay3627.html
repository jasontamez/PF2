Description

This sketchbook has up to 100 pages full of scribbled notes and hasty sketches about monsters. When the user focuses on a particular page, the text and pictures start moving, revealing more details about the creature.

The user must spend 10 minutes researching a particular type of monster to get any benefit from the almanac. If the user is trained in the appropriate Knowledge skill to identify a monster, he gets a +2 circumstance bonus on his check. He can attempt a Knowledge check to identify a creature despite being untrained in the appropriate skill (but without the +2 bonus) as long as thecheck's DC is no higher than 15.
