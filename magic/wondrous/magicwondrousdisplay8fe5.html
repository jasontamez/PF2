Description

These pale, elegant-looking leather gloves have bloodred
stitching on the fingers-which bears a startling
resemblance to blood-encrusted fingernails. Three times
per day, the wearer can use vampiric touch and bleed. If
the wearer uses vampiric touch and holds the charge, the
charge dissipates if the gloves are removed.


Though vampiric touch is normally a touch attack, the
wearer may instead use that ability as a ranged touch attack
with a range of 30 feet, but only against a dying target or a
target suffering from a bleed effect. When using vampiric
touch in this way, the wearer may hold the charge on a
missed ranged touch attack.


If the wearer is suffering from a bleed effect, he may
expend one use of vampiric touch to end the bleed effect.
