Description

This dagger is usually made of chiseled stone, though some varieties are made of sharpened mammoth bone. Its hilt is especially long, as if created for a Large creature, and the blade is carved with a symbol of a woman holding meat in one hand and a stone tablet in the other. The dagger is symbolic, and cannot be used as an actual weapon. Once per day, the wielder can use detect animals or plants.

If the giant goddess Fandarra is the wielder's patron, once per day the wielder can use death knell if he offers the target's blood to the goddess.
