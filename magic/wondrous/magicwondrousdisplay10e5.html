Description

A small magical device patterned on the design of ancient Azlanti relics, a wayfinder is a compact compass typically made from silver and bearing gold accents. While it serves as a badge of office for agents of the Pathfinder Society, a wayfinder is as much a handy tool as a status symbol. With a command word, you can cause a wayfinder to shine (as the <a href="spelldisplay9f2d.html?ItemName=light">light</a> spell). A wayfinder also acts as a nonmagical (magnetic) compass, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. All wayfinders feature a small indentation designed to hold a single <a href="magicwondrous8768.html?FinalSlot=Ioun">ioun stone</a>. An ioun stone slotted in this manner grants you its normal benefits as if it were orbiting your head; some ioun stones can grant additional powers once they are fitted into a wayfinder, at the GM's discretion.
