Description

This golden circlet is set with rubies and is small enough to fit under the standard head regalia of a reigning pharaoh. It functions as a +6 periapt of Wisdom and a circlet of persuasion. If you are the rightful ruler of Osirion, you can use the Ruby Circlet to telepathically communicate with Janhelia, agent of the elemental lords of the desert; this ability functions as long as you and she are on the same plane.
