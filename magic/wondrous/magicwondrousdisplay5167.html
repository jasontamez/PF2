Description

This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its
particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose
inside has been coated with 1 ounce of salve of slipperiness,
and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the
flask, a new application of the salve of slipperiness must be
put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue
from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of sovereign
glue, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the
stuff (1d8-1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's
capacity taken up by the salve of slipperiness. One ounce of
this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually
any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue
takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move
action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the
glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed
to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects
has no effect, except when universal solvent is applied to the
bond. Sovereign glue is dissolved by universal solvent.


The price and creation cost given are per ounce.
