Description

Devil's spit is a more potent form of unholy water, and acts in most ways like a vial of that substance. However, a direct hit by a flask of devil's spit deals 4d4 points of damage to good outsiders and lawful good creatures, 6d4 points of damage to lawful good outsiders, and 2d4 points of damage to all other good-aligned creatures. All creatures within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits take 2 points of damage if they are good outsiders or lawful good creatures, 3 points of damage if they are lawful good outsiders, and 1 point of damage if they are chaotic good or neutral good.

Devil's spit can also be used to charge a rod of burning blood (see below). A single vial of devil's spit provides 5 charges to that item. Charging a rod of burning blood with devil's spit is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
