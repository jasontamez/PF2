Description

This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather,
or wooden box. A full deck consists of 34 cards. When a card is
drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a major image of a
creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory
creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the
card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real.
At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the
card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and
cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is
automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and
the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following
table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents
of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)
