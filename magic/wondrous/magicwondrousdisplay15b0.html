Description

This gray incense smells of cold granite. When burned, the smoke
from the incense spreads to fill a space equal to ten 10-foot
cubes. This smoke remains stationary unless moved by wind.
If inhaled by a creature with blindsense, scent, or tremorsense,
the creature must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If it fails the
save, it does not benefit from its blindsense, tremorsense, or scent abilities for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the smoke from
the incense dissipates and loses all magical properties.
