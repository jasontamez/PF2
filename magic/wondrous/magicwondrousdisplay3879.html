Description

Crafted of stout, wax-treated leather
and wrapped with warm fur reminiscent
of a frost giant's beard, these boots are
sometimes given as gifts by the frost
giant tribes of the north to their smaller
allies. In addition to functioning as boots
of the winterlands, the boots of the winter
jarl enable their wearer to take the form of a frost giant once
per day, as with the giant form I spell. While in giant form,
the wearer gains a +6 size bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to
Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, a +4 natural armor
bonus, low-light vision, rock catching, rock throwing, and resist
cold 20, but also gains vulnerability to fire. The wearer can
remain in giant form for up to 10 minutes.
