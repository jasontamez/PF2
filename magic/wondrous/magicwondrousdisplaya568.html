Description

This small, durable flask is designed to preserve alchemical
extracts indefinitely. An extract stored in a preserving
flask remains potent until it is consumed or otherwise
removed from the flask. Preserved extracts count against an
alchemist's extracts per day on the day they are prepared,
but not on subsequent days. Each flask is capable of
preserving an extract of a particular level. An extract stored
in the flask retains duration, caster level, and other properties
it had when it was created. The flask works on extracts and
infusions, but not mutagens.
