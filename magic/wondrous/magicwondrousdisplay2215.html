Description

A ganji doll is a fetish tied so intimately to its intended victim that good or ill can be done to the target through the doll itself. During the item's creation, the creator must choose a humanoid creature to bind the doll to. This requires the creator to obtain and craft a bit of the intended target's body-typically hair, blood, or a tooth-into the fetish. Once this has been done, the ganji doll affects no other creature aside from the bound target. The target of the ganji doll can't be changed after crafting is complete.

Once the doll has been created, three times per day, any bearer can employ the doll to create any one of the following effects. These effects target only the creature bound to the doll. The target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against these effects.

Blind: Covering the doll's head with a cloth blinds the target for 1 minute (Will DC 16 negates).

Damage: Stabbing the doll with a sharp instrument, waving it over an open flame, wrapping a cord around the doll's neck, or otherwise damaging the doll causes the target to take 3d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC 16 half). This damage ignores all resistances and immunities.

Touch Spell: The ganji doll functions as the bound target for the purpose of any spell with a range of touch. The target receives the effect of any spell cast upon the doll (up to the doll's limit of three effects per day) as if the caster had actually touched him. The target can attempt saving throws against such spells, if allowed, as normal, but takes the -2 penalty imposed by the doll. Beneficial spells, such as cure light wounds, can also be used in this manner.
