Description

This appears to be a rugged leather sack about 4 feet by 6 feet in size. It functions exactly the same as other types of bags of holding, but weighs more and has greater weight and volume limits, as shown on the table below.

Because of the larger volume of a giant-sized bag of holding, retrieving a specific item from it is always a full-round action.

Type V and Type VI bags of holding are most commonly found in use by giants and other Large creatures, but giants of Huge size or larger sometimes use even greater bags of holding.
