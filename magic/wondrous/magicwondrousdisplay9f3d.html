Description

The lenses of this item are made of special crystal, its band
woven with tiny patterns of metallic thread almost invisible
to the naked eye. When placed over the eyes of the wearer,
the lenses enable her to see much better than normal at
distances of 1 foot or less, granting her a +5 competence
bonus on Disable Device checks. Both lenses must be worn
for the magic to be effective.
