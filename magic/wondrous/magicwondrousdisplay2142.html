Description

Made from bone and sun-dried sinew, this masterwork harp
produces a vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the
owner of this item has the bardic performance class feature
he can use it to perform a dirge of doom even if he is not of
sufficient level to normally have access to that ability. A bard
who can use dirge of doom and who plays the harp as part of
his performance increases the effective radius to 60 feet.
