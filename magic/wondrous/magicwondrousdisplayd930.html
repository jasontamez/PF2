Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This tall, slim crystal retort is designed to ferment a small amount of liquid or foodstuff into alcohol. Any suitable sugary food or drink left in the retort for 24 hours ferments into sweet elven wine, although the wine's quality varies according to the quality of the ingredients. If a potion is added to an elven still, the retort consumes it over a period of 24 hours, destroying the potion. During this fermenting process, an elven user can cast any spell suitable for making into a potion into the elven still, imbuing the final wine as if it were a potion of the spell cast. This new potion must have a gp value equal to or less than the potion originally consumed by the elven still.

Wine fermented in an elven still spoils 24 hours after its completion, destroying any magical properties.
