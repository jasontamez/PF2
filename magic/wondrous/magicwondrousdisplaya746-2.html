Description

These sturdy leather robes are edged in fine linen embroidered with runes and holy symbols. If worn by a creature capable of casting divination spells who worships a specific deity, the embroidery shifts to depict symbols and icons appropriate to the wearer's faith. The robes act as a divine focus for such wearers, allowing spells requiring a divine focus to be cast without the need to hold any other holy symbol. Additionally, if the wearer can channel energy, she can do so one additional time per day. If the wearer can lay on hands, she instead gains two additional uses of that ability per day. If the wearer has the fervor class feature, she instead gains two additional uses of fervor per day.
