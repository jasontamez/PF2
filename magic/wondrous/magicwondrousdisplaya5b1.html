Description

This aged and worn scabbard is believed to have once held one of a dozen legendary scimitar relics named Dawnflower's Kiss. From its prolonged proximity to such a divine blade, the scabbard has acquired its own unique magical abilities. Twice per day on command, the wearer can draw forth a blazing beam of red-hot fire from the scabbard that can be wielded as if it were a scimitar, as per flame blade.

If Sarenrae is the wearer's patron, half of the flame blade's damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire.
