Description

When worn, this simple brown robe confers great ability
in unarmed combat. If the wearer has levels in monk, her
AC and unarmed damage are treated as a monk of 5 levels
higher. If donned by a character with the Stunning Fist feat,
the robe lets her make one additional stunning attack per day.
If the character is not a monk, she gains the AC and unarmed
damage of a 5th-level monk (although she does not add her
Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus functions just like the
monk's AC bonus.
