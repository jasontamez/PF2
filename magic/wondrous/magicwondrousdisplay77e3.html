Description

These always come in pairs-two iron
rings, each about 18 inches in diameter.
The rings must be on the same plane
of existence and within 100 miles of
each other to function. Whatever is put
through one ring comes out the other,
and up to 100 pounds of material can
be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through
and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for
instantaneous transport of items or messages, or even attacks.
A character can reach through to grab things near the other
ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively,
a character could stick his head through to look around. A
spellcaster could even cast a spell through a ring gate. A Small
character can make a DC 13 Escape Artist check to slip through.
Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily.
Each ring has an "entry side" and an "exit side," both marked
with appropriate symbols.


The weight listed is per ring.
