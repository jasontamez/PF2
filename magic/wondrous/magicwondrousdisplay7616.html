Description

An elemental gem comes in one of four different varieties. Each
contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific elemental plane
(Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).


When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard
action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a
summon nature's ally spell. The elemental is under the control of
the creature that broke the gem.


The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it
summons. Air elemental gems are transparent, earth elemental
gems are light brown, fire elemental gems are reddish orange,
and water elemental gems are blue-green.
