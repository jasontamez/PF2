Description

This grotesque leather mask is sewn together from pieces of faces taken from many humanoids. When the user places the mask against the face of a willing, pinned, or helpless humanoid as a full-round action, the mask's appearance changes to match the face of that creature. This effect functions even if the creature is dead, provided that the creature has been dead for less than 24 hours or has been treated with gentle repose. Thereafter, for 24 hours, the mask grants the following abilities to any humanoid creature wearing it.

First, the mask changes the wearer's shape to match that of the creature whose face is stored in the mask, as per alter self except she is able to transform into a specific creature and does not gain the listed size bonus to an ability score or the other racial abilities (such as darkvision and scent). The mask duplicates the imitated creature's appearance so accurately that the wearer takes no penalties on Disguise checks for being disguised as different gender, race, age category, or size category, and she gains the usual +10 bonus on Disguise checks from using alter self. Second, the wearer can speak any languages the imitated creature knows. Lastly, the wearer's alignment and other auras match the imitated creature, as per misdirection, but with no save. When the duration ends, the mask reverts to its ugly, leathery form and can be used again to steal a creature's face. The duration can't be ended early, nor can the mask be used to imitate a new creature while it's still holding a character's visage; however, the wearer can still remove and replace the mask during that time.
