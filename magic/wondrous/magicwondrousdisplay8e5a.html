Description

This magnificent feather, plucked from the wing of a powerful erinyes or angel, allows the wearer to call stronger outsiders to her service. The wearer can use the feather to call 2 more HD worth of creatures when casting a planar binding or planar ally spell (including lesser and greater versions) or when casting gate. Alternatively, when casting one of these spells, the spellcaster can expend this feather to summon a single outsider with up to 2 more Hit Dice than the spell would normally allow. For example, he may summon a trumpet archon with planar ally, or a pit fiend with greater planar binding. The wearer gains a +2 insight bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks to influence the creature called. Once used, the feather crumbles to mundane dust.
