Description

This simple wooden toothpick is useful for creating flashy diversions on stage or in a fight. Breaking the toothpick causes a blinding flash and a dark cloud of smoke to appear. Creatures other than the user within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. The cloud of smoke spreads 20 feet in all directions, obscures all sight (including darkvision), and lasts for 3 rounds.
