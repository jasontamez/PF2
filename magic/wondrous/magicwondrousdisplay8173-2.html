Description

This heavy cloak is made of blue scaled leather and has a
pointed hem that hangs near the ground. The cloak provides
the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on Will saves, a continuous
feather fall effect (as the spell), and the ability to use fly once
per day. At will as a swift action, the wearer can form the
hem into a stinger, granting her a sting natural weapon. This
sting deals 1d6 points of damage plus poison (as the spell; DC
16). Reverting the stinger to its normal, inconspicuous shape
is a free action.
