Description

Ruined scraps of various constructs
were repurposed and combined to
form this ornate iron helmet. Though
the helmet is not intelligent, it has a
brute mechanical cunning that allows
it to assert control whenever the
wearer's mind is overwhelmed. The
helmet takes control of the wearer's
body anytime he is dazed or stunned. Whenever the wearer
would be dazed, he is instead confused. Whenever the wearer
would be stunned, he is instead confused and staggered.



Time spent under the cap's influence counts against the
duration of the daze or stun effect. The cap functions for up to
5 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
The cap stops asserting control over its wearer when the
duration of the daze or stun effect ends, or when the cap's 5
rounds of duration are expended.
