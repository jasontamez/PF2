Description

This gauzy veil sharpens the wearer's hearing, enhances her ability to interpret others' words, and improves her ability to perceive multiple conversations simultaneously. Veils of attentiveness have historically been popular among Iadaran diplomats or savvy elven political players in densely populated places. They are still especially prized in crowded areas where nobles gather, such as royal courts or upscale dining and lounging establishments in Iadara and beyond.

The wearer of a veil of attentiveness gains a +2 competence bonus on hearing-based Perception checks and on Sense Motive checks to interpret others' meaning or to detect possible deception. In addition, when listening to multiple speakers' voices, the wearer of a veil of attentiveness can understand each speaker as though she were listening only to that voice.
