Description

If a character drinks this gray liquid, the next time (within 24 hours) he falls below 0 hit points, he exhales a sliver of his consciousness-whether he is alive or dead. If a character drinks multiple elixirs in a 24-hour period, only one is effective.

As an immediate action, the sliver can guide the action of one ally within 30 feet of the drinker's body. This guidance gives a +2 luck bonus on that ally's next attack roll, to the ally's AC against the next attack made against her, or on the ally's next skill check. The drinker decides the type of bonus and the ally. The bonus must be used within 1 round.
