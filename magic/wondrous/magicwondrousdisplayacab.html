Description

This wayfinder has a mother-of-pearl casing with perfect swirls
of pink and green patterns covering the face of the device. It
hangs on an 8-inch-long silver fob chain that makes it twirl
slightly when held aloft.

In addition to the standard functions of a wayfinder (including
the ability to create light), a hypnotic wayfinder can be used
once per day to mesmerize weak-minded creatures that can see
it. When dangled by its fob and swung gently in a pendulumlike
motion, the hypnotic wayfinder seems to change colors
as light plays off its pearlescent exterior. This replicates the
effects of hypnotic pattern (Will DC 13 negates), centered on
the hypnotic wayfinder, but creates no visible light aside from
the illusory color-shifts on the wayfinder itself. The wayfinder's
wielder is immune to this effect, as are sightless creatures.

While the effect is active, the wielder must remain stationary
or the effect immediately ends. Otherwise, the effect lasts as
long as the wielder swings the wayfinder at the end of its fob
(a standard action) and for 2 rounds thereafter.
