Description

This alabaster headdress is studded with lines of delicate rubies and represents the height of Kersite fashion mixed with Kalistocratic needs. These austere headdresses come with an imbued soul-one utterly dedicated to assisting the adherents of the Prophecies of Kalistrade unto death. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can allow the personality within the miter to rise to the fore of her own consciousness. This effect lasts for 1 minute, during which the wearer can roll twice and use the higher result for all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer can activate this ability after such a skill check has been rolled but before the result is determined, allowing for a reroll.

Additionally, once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can gain the benefits of tower of iron will V, as the possessing spirit rises to block any mental effects against the wearer. This ability can be used regardless of whether the miter's other ability is active.
