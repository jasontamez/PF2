Description

This pair of clear crystal lenses allows the wearer to see the indistinct shapes of living creatures moving below the surface of the earth. The wearer can see any Medium or larger creatures within 60 feet as long as they are moving underground. The wearer must have seen the creature aboveground within the past minute while wearing the goggles to gain this benefit. Each subsequent round after the first that the goggles are worn, the wearer has a cumulative 5% chance of immediately going blind for 1d4 rounds. Once the goggles are removed, the wearer's eyes need 1 hour to adjust before he or she can wear the goggles again.
