Description

This heavy, cold-iron amulet depicts a bear's head with jaws open in a roar. It increases the wearer's uncanny dodge ability, causing it to function as improved uncanny dodge. (The amulet has no benefit for characters who do not have uncanny dodge). If the wearer already has improved uncanny dodge, treat his class level as 4 higher for the purpose of determining the number of rogue levels an attacker must have in order to sneak attack the wearer by flanking him.
