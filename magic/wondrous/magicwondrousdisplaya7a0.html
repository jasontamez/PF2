Description

This necklace is set with a bloodstone sculpted to look like a
scintillating green eye. It gives the wearer a +4 competence
bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based checks made
to interact with gnomes, a +2 competence bonus on similar
checks when dealing with beings of the fey creature type,
and a -2 penalty on similar checks when interacting with
anyone else. The wearer can read, speak, and understand
the Gnome language. If the wearer is not a gnome, she
gains low-light vision, and may cast dancing lights, ghost
sound, prestidigitation, and speak with animals each once
per day as a spell-like ability.
