Description

This amulet is crafted from a dragon scale hung on a thin wire of twisted mithral. There are 10 different types of amulet of dragon's breath, each corresponding to one of the 10 dragon types. As a standard action, the wearer of an amulet of dragon's breath can breathe out a blast of energy similar to a dragon's breath weapon. This breath weapon deals 8d6 points of energy damage (Reflex DC 16 for half). The breath weapon's shape and energy type depend on the type of dragon scale used to craft the amulet (see page 75 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for a list of dragon types, energy types, and breath shapes). A new amulet of dragon's breath can be used three times before the dragon scale cracks and the amulet becomes useless.
