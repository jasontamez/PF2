Description

These heavy leather gloves ripple
and flows at the wearer's command,
reshaping to fit any hand, claw, tentacle,
or alien limb. The wearer's melee touch
attacks with that hand deal 1d6 points
of acid damage. If the wearer uses that hand to wield a weapon
or make an attack with an unarmed strike or natural weapon,
that attack gains the corrosive weapon special ability.


The wearer's gloved hand is protected from the acid ability
of oozes, allowing him to use that hand to attack oozes with
unarmed strikes or natural attacks without risk of harm from
contact with the ooze. These unarmed strikes and natural attacks
never cause an ooze to split.
