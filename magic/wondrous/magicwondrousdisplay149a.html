Description

This silvery ring looks like a halo. When worn by a tiefling
it hovers just above his head, though it still uses the head
magic item slot. It helps to calm the baser emotions and the
dark whispers that plague tieflings, granting the wearer a
+4 resistance bonus on saving throws against all spells with
the emotion descriptor. When worn by a tiefling of a good
alignment, it provides spell resistance 13 against spells with
the evil descriptor and a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws.
