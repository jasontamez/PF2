Description

This reversible multicolored cape marks the wearer's
flamboyant audacity when turned with its bright colors
outward, granting a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks.
Reversible as a move action, the dappled camouflage of its
other side grants a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Regardless of the cape's current facing, the wearer can spend an immediate action at will to roll an Escape Artist check against being grappled, bound, or restrained as if the cape targeted her with liberating command (Ultimate Combat)
