Description

Four sunstone-embedded sunflowers adorn this golden diadem. The first daylight diadems were created far to the east by Keleshite worshipers of Sarenrae, but their usefulness in battling undead has seen them become quite widespread. In the often overcast Sodden Lands, these magical diadems offer an additional comfort to those who enjoy the sun as well, serving as a constant reminder that regardless of the cloud cover above, the sun remains steadfast in its guardianship over the day.

As part of a standard action taken to channel positive energy, the wearer can activate a daylight diadem by removing a flower to extend the range of her channel positive energy ability to 60 feet. The removed flower is consumed upon use.

The wearer can also release the full brilliance of her daylight diadem in a single burst. With a command word, she causes all of the sunflowers remaining on the daylight diadem to be consumed and shed bright light in a 60-foot radius. This light counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower and is treated as natural sunlight-the effect persists for a number of rounds equal to double the number of sunflowers consumed. While within the area of this light, all weapons are treated as good-aligned for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction and deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to evil creatures. This additional damage results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to energy. Creatures that are specifically hindered or harmed by sunlight take double this amount (2d6 points of damage per hit).

Once all four flowers have been used, a daylight diadem can no longer be activated, but each time the crown is exposed to the light of the rising sun, a new sunflower (to a maximum of four sunflowers) blooms on the diadem.
