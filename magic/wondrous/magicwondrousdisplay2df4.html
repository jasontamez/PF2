Description

This elaborately tapered lattice of adamantine and copper channels the essence of one plane to which it has been attuned. Whenever it leaves a plane of existence, it becomes attuned to one planar trait from among the following that the plane possessed: minor negative-dominant, minor positivedominant, mildly aligned. If a plane had multiple appropriate traits, one is chosen randomly. If the plane has a more powerful version of one of these traits, the item attunes to the weaker version of the trait. Once per day, when a command word is spoken, the area within a 30-foot-radius emanation centered on the funnel gains the attuned trait for 1 minute. If the user of a void funnel chooses, she becomes immune to any negative effects of the funnel when it's activated.
