Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This elaborately woven leather beaded cord shifts in coloration from light gray at the front to pitch black at the back. Once per day on command, the headband allows the wearer to make any choices for an ongoing nonpermanent illusion as if she were casting the illusion, although its duration is not reset and she cannot change its target or area. The spell's effect changes to match those choices, and its remaining duration plays out as if the wearer were its original caster. To affect the illusion, the wearer must succeed at a caster level check (with a +13 bonus for the headband's caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the illusion's creator's caster level.

If the wearer is an elf, she can use a second command word to cause the headband to produce illusory duplicates of up to six allies similar to how mirror image functions once per day. The wearer can control any number of the duplicates with a move action provided they all receive the same commands, but otherwise they mimic the actions of the originals and remain in the original's square. When in the original creature's square, the image functions exactly as mirror image, but when the headband's wearer directs them separately, the images have an AC equal to the original's AC - 5 and are destroyed by any successful attack roll against that AC.
