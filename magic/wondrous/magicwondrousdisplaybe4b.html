Description

This round metal container is just large enough to contain
the wooden, coin-sized token inside. Each side of the token
is inscribed with a different prayer. Once per day, a cleric
(or other class with cleric domains) may activate the pyxes
and may select any one of her prepared domain spells and
replace it with the domain spell of that level from her other
domain. For example, a cleric with the Fire and Luck domains
could switch her 1st-level prepared burning hands domain
spell to true strike. The pyxes has no effect on creatures with
no domain spells or only one domain.
