Description

Made of a glassy, translucent substance, this orb swirls with the
eldritch energy of spellcasters long departed. When the bearer
researches a spell to create a new spell or learn an existing
one from another source (see Chapter 9 of the Pathfinder RPG
Core Rulebook), this orb provides a +2 competence bonus on
Spellcraft checks.

Additionally, when the command word is spoken, an orb
of arcane research allows its bearer to gain a +5 insight
bonus on a Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge
(nature), or Spellcraft check made to research a spell or
extract formula (see page 86 of Ultimate Campaign). The orb
can be used five times in this way before the item cracks,
losing all of its magical properties and reverting to a piece of
mundane glass.
