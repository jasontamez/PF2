Description

This malevolent-looking doll is made out of cheap rags and
embroidery thread and is stuffed with straw or sawdust. A
creature holding or carrying the doll takes a -4 penalty on
saving throws against witch hexes. Alternatively, if the doll is
stuffed with the hair of a creature, any witch holding the doll
increases the DC of her hexes by +2 when using the hexes
against that creature. A doll used in this way does not cause
the witch to take a penalty on her saving throws.
