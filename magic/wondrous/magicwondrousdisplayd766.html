Description

A pair of these wings might appear to be
nothing more than a plain cloak of old, black
cloth, or they could be as elegant as a long cape
of blue feathers. When the wearer speaks the
command word, the cloak turns into a pair of
bat or bird wings that empower her to fly with
a speed of 60 feet (average maneuverability),
also granting a +5 competence bonus on Fly
skill checks.
