Description

This time-weathered wayfinder lacks any notable features.  Despite its routine appearance, a smuggler's wayfinder has  an additional ability generally known only to the person using  it. When a command word is spoken, the compass's interior is  replaced with a small extradimensional space that can hold up  to 10 pounds of material occupying no more than 1 cubic foot  of space. This material must be able to fit through the 3-inch-diameter  opening in the compass's face (such as a thin glass  vial, coins, small jewelry, or a rolled-up piece of paper). While  the extradimensional space is accessible, all other properties of  the wayfinder cease to function, including any resonant ioun  stone powers. While the extradimensional space is hidden, the  smuggler's wayfinder emits an aura of faint evocation, as a  standard wayfinder.
