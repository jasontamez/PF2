Description

This thick silver needle is approximately 6 inches long and can be carefully inserted into the brain of a willing or helpless target in order to magically expand the target's knowledge. Implanting a lore needle takes 10 minutes and requires a successful DC 15 Heal check. A user can insert the needle into her own head with a successful DC 25 Heal check. On a failure, the needle deals 2 points of Constitution damage and 2 points of Intelligence damage to the target and is not implanted. A creature with an implanted lore needle can, up to three times per day when attempting a Knowledge check, apply to that check its bonus on any other single Knowledge skill in which it is trained.
