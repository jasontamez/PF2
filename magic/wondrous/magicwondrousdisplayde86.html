Description

These spectacles bear no markings or decoration, but they are obviously sturdy and of high quality. The wearer of these spectacles gains the ability to better understand written material and unravel the language of contracts. The wearer gains a +5 bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher writing, detect forgeries, research in a library (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue 148), research an infernal contract (Pathfinder RPG Book of the Damned 203), or attempt similar types of examinations. Additionally, he is automatically aware if a contract he's examining has any deliberate obfuscations or loopholes, though he might not know exactly what they are.
