Description

Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once. A particular feather token has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed-even tokens with identical powers can be wildly different in appearance.

Anchor: A token that creates an anchor that moors a craft
in water so as to render it immobile for up to 1 day.

Lance: This token turns into a white-plumed +1 lance for 1 minute. This token is often used when carrying a large weapon is illegal or impractical.

Fan: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a
breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25
mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed.
The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds,
creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave
size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to
8 hours. It does not function on land.

Sky Hook: This token transforms into a huge disembodied eagle's talon (hardness 5, hp 25) anchored wherever you activate it. The talon can support up to 1,000 pounds and persists for 1 day. The talon can be moved up to 10 feet with a DC 20 Strength check.

Bird: A token that creates a small bird that can be used to
deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated
target. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the
message.

Catapult: This token creates a standard catapult (Ultimate Combat 161). The catapult disappears after 12 hours.

Tree: A token that causes a great oak to spring into
being (5-foot-diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top
diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.

Floating Feather: This token can be attached to any creature up to 200 pounds, causing a pair of large wings to grow from the target and allowing her to fly (speed 30, average maneuverability) for 1 minute. The token can be attached to an object of up to 200 pounds, which flies straight in a direction indicated by the creature who activates the feather unless the activator uses a move action to redirect its movement. The wings persist for 1 minute.

Swan Boat: A token that forms a swan-like boat capable
of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight
horses and gear, 32 Medium characters, or any equivalent
combination. The boat lasts for 1 day.

Campsite: This feather token can be used only once. It creates a fully
functional campsite, including a tent suitable to house six Medium
creatures, a campfire with enough dry wood to burn for 24 hours,
a modest wooden table with two benches suitable to seat three
people each, and a hitching post for up to six steeds. The campsite
remains for up to 24 hours before disappearing, leaving no trace
except footsteps and refuse left behind by those using the site.

Ram: This token creates a Huge ram (Ultimate Combat 165). The ram disappears after 24 hours.

Whip: A token that forms into a huge leather whip and
wields itself against any opponent desired just like a dancing
weapon. The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does
1d6+1 points of nonlethal damage, has a +1 enhancement
bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free
grapple attack (with a +15 bonus on its combat maneuver
checks) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.

Tar and Feathers: This token can be directed to float to any point within 60 feet and then burst into a mass of sticky white feathers that adheres to all creatures in a 10-foot radius. The clinging feathers affect creatures in the area as a glitterdust spell.

Siege Tower: This token creates a Huge siege tower (Ultimate Combat 165). The tower disappears after 1 hour.
