Description

This stiff folded paper vaguely
resembles a hand-sized pest such
as a beetle, spider, or cockroach.
Completing two key folds in the paper
causes it to multiply into hundreds
of similar-sized duplicates of itself.
These duplicates fill a 10-foot space and act as a rat swarm,
except they have fire vulnerability, the construct type, and do
not have the disease special ability. The paper beetles do not
attack their creator, but are otherwise uncontrolled and attack
anything nearby. After 5 rounds, the beetles crumple and fall
inert. Once activated, an origami swarm loses all magic.
