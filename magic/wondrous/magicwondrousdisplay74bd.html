Description

An ancient fossilized insect lies trapped within this ornate
amber clasp, impaled by the long golden pin that fastens the
wearer's cloak. The wearer's weapons, unarmed attacks, and
natural attacks deal full damage to swarms, regardless of
the swarm's immunity to weapon damage (if any, although
damage reduction applies as normal). If the wearer is damaged
by a swarm, she automatically succeeds on her saving throw
against the swarm's distraction ability.
