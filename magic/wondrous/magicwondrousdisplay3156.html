Description

This iridescent spiraling shell can be blown once per day as a standard action to activate any one of these functions: <ul><li>Calm rough waters in a 40-foot radius. This reduces the DCs of Swim checks in the area by 5 (to a minimum of 10). This effect lasts for 5 minutes.</li><li>Summon up to six hippocampi. The creatures appear with bit, bridle, and a riding saddle crafted for aquatic use. They serve willingly and well, entering combat and risking attack unflinchingly if a rider directs them to do so (treat them as combat-trained mounts), though they don't make attacks of their own. These hippocampi serve the PCs for up to 2 hours.</li><li>Create a soothing effect in a 40-foot radius that affects only animals and magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 that also have the aquatic or amphibious subtype. This otherwise functions as calm animals (Will DC 12 negates).</li></ul> The sounding of this magical horn can be heard by all tritons within a 1-mile radius.
