Description

This valuable garment appears
to be a normal robe until it is put
on. Its wearer is able to see in all
directions at the same moment due
to scores of visible, magical eye-like
patterns that adorn the robe. She
also gains 120-foot darkvision.


The robe of eyes sees all forms
of invisible or ethereal creatures
or objects within 120 feet. The wearer of a robe of eyes gains
a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks. She retains
her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and can't
be flanked. She is not able to avert or close her eyes when
confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.


A light or continual flame spell cast directly on a robe of
eyes causes the wearer to be blinded for 1d3 minutes. A
daylight spell blinds the wearer for 2d4 minutes.
