Description

Often used by spies and arcane
scholars to steal important texts
without alerting their owners,
a book thief’s satchel contains
enough room to hold a single tome
of no more than 1,000 pages and no larger than 12 by 18 inches
in size. Prior to using the satchel, its bearer must place a blank
book in the satchel and utter a command word. This blank book
is sequestered in an extradimensional space accessible only upon
command. (A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.)

Once per day, when another book, folio, scroll, or other text
is placed within the satchel while a blank book is hidden within
the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly added
book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain
unchanged). The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on
the pages of the blank book in the satchel’s extradimensional
pocket. The transfer takes 1 full round, and if the process is
interrupted, such as by either book being removed or the satchel
being significantly damaged, the text being copied is lost forever.
If the blank book is smaller in size (in number of pages for a book
or number of inches for a scroll) than the book to be stolen, the
satchel doesn’t transfer the contents, and the text being copied
is lost forever.

A book thief’s satchel can’t transfer magical writing (such as
the pages of a wizard’s spellbook, a magical scroll, or a wondrous
item). Attempts to do so fail immediately, neither erasing the book
to be copied nor copying any of the pages to the blank book.
