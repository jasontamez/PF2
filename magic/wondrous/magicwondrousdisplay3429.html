Description

This small bar of coarse gray soap has tiny pieces of ash, coal,
or hard earth embedded in it, leaving anyone washed with it as
dirty as before. Washing a creature with the soap requires water
and takes 1 minute, after which the creature can attempt a new
Will saving throw against any hostile ongoing mind-affecting
effect currently affecting it. Unwilling creatures must be pinned
or otherwise made helpless before they can be washed. The
soap is sufficient to wash one creature.
