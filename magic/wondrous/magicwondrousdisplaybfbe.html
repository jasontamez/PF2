Description

This helm functions like a helm of brilliance but is lower-powered.
Instead of the standard helm's allotment of gems,
the lesser helm has 10 diamonds (fireball, 10d6 damage,
Reflex DC 20 half), 20 corals (flaming sphere), 30 garnets
(scorching ray), and 40 agates (light). It still glows near and
harms undead, has the flaming weapon special ability, and
provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).


Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if
damaged by magical fire; diamonds become fireballs centered
on the wearer, corals become flaming spheres in and adjacent
to the wearer's space, garnets become scorching rays that fire
randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm
itself are destroyed.
