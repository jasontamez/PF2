Description

This ornate brass key automatically
reshapes itself to fit any standard
keyhole (generally those in doors scaled
for use by Small or Medium creatures,
not deliberately oversized locks like the
main door to a dwarven fortress). Once
placed inside a lock, the key merges with the lock and fills
up all open spaces within it, creating a solid piece of metal
and making it impossible to unlock it, even with magic. While
securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding
+2 to the lock's hardness, +8 to its hit points, and +5 to its
Break DC. Touching the key and speaking the command word
causes the key to disintegrate, leaving the lock intact and
rendering the mechanism operable again.
