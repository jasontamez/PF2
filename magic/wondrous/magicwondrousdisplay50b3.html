Description

This horn is bound with fittings of gold and decorated with ornate
carvings depicting scenes of glorious battle. A fully charged horn
has 3 charges-charges used are automatically renewed each
day. So long as the horn has at least one charge remaining, it's
owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic
drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking
from the horn to gain the following benefits:


1 charge: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points (as if
from an aid spell), which last for 1 minute.


2 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is
enlarged, as the spell enlarge person, for 5 minutes.


3 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is
enlarged for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a heroism spell
for as long as she is enlarged.


A creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive
its full benefit. Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a
potion-it takes a standard action and provokes an attack of
opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action
required). To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full
round drinking from the horn, which always provokes and
attack of opportunity. To use all 3 charges, the drinker must
spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn.
