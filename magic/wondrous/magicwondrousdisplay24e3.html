Description

This intricate gold headband is
decorated with several small blue
and deep purple gemstones. The
headband grants the wearer an
enhancement bonus to Intelligence of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the
headband is worn. A headband of vast intelligence has one
skill associated with it per +2 bonus it grants. After being worn
for 24 hours, the headband grants a number of skill ranks in
those skills equal to the wearer's total Hit Dice. These ranks
do not stack with the ranks a creature already possesses.
These skills are chosen when the headband is created. If no
skill is listed, the headband is assumed to grant skill ranks in
randomly determined Knowledge skills.
