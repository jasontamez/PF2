Description

This item is a tiny box containing
religious scripture. The box is affixed
to a leather cord and tied around
the forehead, worn so that the box
sits upon the wearer's brow. There
is no mundane way to determine what function this religious
item performs until it is worn. The wearer of a phylactery of
faithfulness is aware of any action or item that could adversely
affect her alignment and her standing with her deity, including
magical effects. She acquires this information prior to performing
such an action or becoming associated with such an item if she
takes a moment to contemplate the act.
