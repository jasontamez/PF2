Description

This stone tablet bears inscriptions detailing a notable being who fell short of achieving godhood in the Test of the Starstone. As a move action, the tablet's holder can break it to release a remnant of latent divinity. The resultant burst of power imbues the user, granting a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. In addition, the user can attempt a new saving throw against one ongoing effect, such as a disease.
