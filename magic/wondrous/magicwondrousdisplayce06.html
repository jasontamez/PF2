Description

The wearer of this robe can cause the
garment to display a shifting pattern
of incredible hues, color after color
cascading from the upper part of the
robe to the hem in sparkling rainbows
of dazzling light. The colors daze those
near the wearer, conceal the wearer,
and illuminate the surroundings. It
takes 1 full round after the wearer
speaks the command word for the colors to start flowing on
the robe. The colors create the equivalent of a gaze attack
with a 30-foot range. Those who look at the wearer are dazed
for 1d4+1 rounds (Will DC 16 negates). This is a mind-affecting
pattern effect.


Every round of continuous scintillation of the robe gives
the wearer better concealment. The miss chance on attacks
against the wearer starts at 10% and increases by 10% each
round until it reaches 50% (total concealment). Additionally
the robe continuously illuminates a 30-foot radius. The effect
can be used no more than a total of 10 rounds per day.
