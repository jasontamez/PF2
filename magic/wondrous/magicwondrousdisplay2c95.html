Description

This onyx talisman resembles a majestic black stallion covered in carved wavy lines and bearing a tiny twine bridle. When the command word is spoken, it transforms into a saddled and thoroughbred light horse that serves you willingly. The command word also returns it to talisman form. If slain, the horse reverts to talisman form and cannot be activated again for 24 hours.

Each talisman's horse form has a specific color (black, brown, gray, pinto, and so on) and markings (blazes, stars, stockings, etc.), chosen by the creator when the item is crafted.
