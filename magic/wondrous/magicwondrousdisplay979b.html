Description

The wearer of a pair of stonemeld boots gains a +4 bonus to CMD against bull rush, drag, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers. Additionally, once per day as a swift action, the boots can be activated to grant the wearer a climb speed of 10 feet on any natural stone surface (but not manufactured stone surfaces like brick walls) for 30 minutes. A creature using stonemeld boots to climb in this fashion leaves obvious deformities in the rock surface. Anyone attempting to track a wearer of stonemeld boots moving in this fashion treats the base DC as though the tracks were left in soft earth, and takes no penalties for time elapsed since the tracks were made.
