Description

This thumb-sized crystalline skull is carved with necromantic
runes. Once per day, a spellcaster can grasp the stone while
casting a summoning spell. When the spellcasting is finished,
the caster may immediately attempt to possess the summoned
creature, as if using magic jar, except as a free action. The creature
does not get a saving throw to resist, though spell resistance still
applies. If successful, the caster possesses the creatures' body
until the duration of the summoning spell ends, at which time his
mind returns to his body, the creature's mind returns to its body,
and the creature disappears.
