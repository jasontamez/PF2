Description

This furry brown belt resembles the tail of a monkey. The belt
grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Treat
this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt
is worn. The wearer does not lose his Dexterity bonus to AC
while climbing, and does not take a -5 penalty on Climb
checks when climbing at half his speed. As a swift action
the wearer can command the belt to animate, transforming
it into a prehensile tail under the wearer's control. The
tail does not grant the wearer any additional attacks or
actions per round, nor can it wield weapons, but it can
make unarmed attacks and hold or manipulate objects
about as well as the wearer's normal limbs (though any
activity requiring fingers is beyond the tail's capabilities).
The belt can function as a tail for 5 minutes per day. These
minutes do not need to be consecutive.
