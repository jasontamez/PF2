Description

This magically-augmented alchemical device distills a potion
or alchemist extract into the knowledge needed to create its
formula. By gently heating a potion or extract in the alembic
for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical liquid. If
consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge
of the potion's or extract's formula, as if it were an extract
he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24
hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the
normal fashion.


Using the alembic does not harm the potion, but the
process makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally).
The alembic can only distill the knowledge of formulas on
the alchemist extract list (for example, it cannot turn a
potion of a cleric-only spell into something an alchemist
can learn).
