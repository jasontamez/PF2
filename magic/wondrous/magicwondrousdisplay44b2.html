Description

These steel cuffs are connected with a 2-foot-long chain. The cuffs are decorated with lead inlays of broken feet. When locked around a helpless or willing creature's ankles as a full-round action, the creature can move only half its normal speed for all its forms of movement. The creature that placed the ankle chains can remove them with a command word, any creature can remove them with a successful DC 30 Disable Device check, and the restrained creature can remove them with a successful DC 30 Escape Artist check. Dispelling the ankle chains doesn't assist in removing them, though it does prevent the creature that placed the ankle chains from using the command word to remove them for as long as their effects are suppressed or dispelled.
