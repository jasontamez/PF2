Description

Six inches in diameter, one side of this porcelain seal shows a
many-keyholed padlock, while the other displays a lightning bolt
superimposed on an open hand. The padlock side is used to lock
and alarm doors, chests, and other portals. The bearer may speak
a command word to activate it when holding it against a lockable
item. If the padlock side of the seal is touching the item, it
bestows an alarm (mental alarm) and arcane lock on the target
item. If the lightning bolt side of the seal is touching the item, it
casts fire trap on the lock (the seal must be held to the lock for 10
minutes to use this ability).


A creature carrying the seal can speak a command word to
suspend its effects on an item for 1 minute. This ability is usable
at will, but only works on effects created by that specific seal.


The seal can be used at will but can only maintain effects
on three items at any given time. Using it on a fourth item
automatically negates the oldest effect.
