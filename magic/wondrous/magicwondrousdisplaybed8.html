Description

This protective ward is fashioned from a thin, supple piece of wood bound in a circle, and then woven with sinew to create a weblike pattern. Dreamcatchers are often decorated with beads and feathers. More elaborate dreamcatchers might be made of gold or silver instead, and decorated with dangling jewels and metal figurines.

A dreamcatcher protects its sleeping owner from malicious influences. The owner gains a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws while asleep. Further, any ability damage or ability drain he takes during this time is reduced by 1 point (to a minimum of 0 points).
