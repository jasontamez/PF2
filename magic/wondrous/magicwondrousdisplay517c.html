Description

Boots of friendly terrain turn inhospitable
territory into a perfect hunting grounds for
any ranger who wears them, so much so
that his footprints vanish behind him with
each step he takes. Each pair of these supple
leather boots corresponds to a specific sort
of environment as defined by the ranger's favored terrain class
feature (jungles, plains, and so on). A ranger wearing the boots
can treat the corresponding environment of the boots as one of
his favored terrains, granting him a +2 bonus. If he already has
that particular environment as one of his favored terrains, that
terrain's bonus increases by 2.
