Description

One side of this reversible gray hooded
cape is exquisitely embroidered and
richly decorated, while the other appears
shabby and worn. On command, by
passing the edge of the cloak over her
face, the wearer may remove a mundane
disguise (one applied with the Disguise
skill) and store it in the cloak. This does
not change the cloak's appearance in
any way. Once a disguise is stored in the
cloak, it can be reapplied to the wearer who placed it within
the cloak on command, using the original result of the Disguise
check. The cloak can store up to three disguises at once, and any
wearer of the cloak can discard any number of disguises within
the cloak as a free action.
