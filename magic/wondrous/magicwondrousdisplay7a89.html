Wisps of black smoke dance above these gray, fetchling-made pauldrons. The wearer can manipulate these strands of shadow matter, assailing a target within 60 feet as a move action to create any of the effects listed below. All sustained effects last as long as the wearer concentrates to maintain them or up to 1 minute. The effects of these shadowy tendrils can be ignored with a successful DC 16 Will save. An ebony bolero has 5 charges, which regenerate at dusk each day. Each of the following assaults uses 1 charge. <ul><li>Emotion: The wearer can smother a target's emotions as if by a calm emotions spell.

The wearer can expend 2 charges when using this ability to increase the duration the target must rage to 3 rounds.</li><li>Memory: The wearer can blot out the target's memories of events from the past minute. This functions as modify memory, but can only eliminate memories.</li><li>Thoughts: The wearer can delve into a target's mind and pluck out thoughts, as per detect thoughts.</li><li>Vision: The wearer can wind wisps of shadow matter around a creature's eyes, blinding it for as long as the wearer concentrates.
