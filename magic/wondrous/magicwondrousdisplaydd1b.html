Description

This copper clasp adorned with a piece of amber is used to fasten
a cloak or cape. When its wearer takes electricity damage,
this brooch absorbs up to 20 points of electrical damage and
holds that electrical charged until it is released by its wielder or
harmlessly at the end of 10 minutes, whichever occurs first. The
brooch can absorb up to 50 points of electricity damage per day.
The wielder can release the charge on command, unleashing
any electricity in the brooch as if casting a shocking grasp
spell (dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per 5 points of
damage held).
