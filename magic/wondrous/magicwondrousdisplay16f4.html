Description

Usually made from the skins of giant serpents, these cloaks are
designed to help rangers, hunters, and trackers blend in with
and travel quickly through the areas they are most familiar with.
If the wearer has the favored terrain class ability and is traveling
through one of his favored terrains, he can
transform himself into an animal native to that environment.
This works identically to the beast shape I spell, save that it is
limited to creatures native to the environment (as defined in
the appropriate Bestiary entry or per the GMs discretion). This
effect lasts for 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be
continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
