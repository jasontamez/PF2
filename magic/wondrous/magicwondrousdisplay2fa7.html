Description

This specialized carpet of flying always measures 10 feet by 10 feet. When it's in flight, its passengers are shielded from wind and extreme temperatures as if inside a tiny hut (though without creating an opaque, immobile sphere). In addition, once per day while the carpet of comfort is on the ground, a command word transforms the carpet into an opulent silk tent that, other than its appearance, is equivalent to a secure shelter.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, overland flight, secure shelter, tiny hut; Cost 45,000 gp
