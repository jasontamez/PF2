Description

This rope is 100 feet long and can perform all the functions of a
rope of climbing. Furthermore, upon command the rope of knots
snakes out and knots itself into a rope structure. The rope can tie
itself into any structure which can be created out of 100 feet of
rope. Possible structures include (but are not limited to) a sturdy
rope bridge up to 25 feet long, a 10-foot-square net or hammock,
or a 40-foot-tall rope ladder. The rope takes up to 10 rounds to
create a complex structure or half that time to return itself to a
simple coil. The rope has hardness 1 and 20 hit points. It repairs
damage to itself at a rate of 2 hit points every 10 minutes.
