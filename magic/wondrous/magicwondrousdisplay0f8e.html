Description

This simple, hand-painted party mask emanates no magical aura. Its true usefulness is revealed only when it's worn. When a person dons the mask, she instantly assumes the appearance of single specific Small or Medium humanoid creature. Each mask has a single "face" that can't be changed once the item is created. This effect otherwise works as disguise self.
