Description

In areas where divine magic is readily available, speak with dead has captured many a murderer; this serum was invented by assassins to silence their victims. Murderer's silence prevents a corpse from communicating via speak with dead by dissolving the victim's vocal organs. To use this item, the thick black liquid must be slowly poured down the throat of the corpse (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity). The following round, the corpse's tongue, vocal cords, and lips deteriorate and the corpse becomes incapable of responding to speak with dead. Other means of interrogating the spirit of the departed still function normally. Magic that restores the flesh to a corpse doesn't restore any parts rotted away by murderer's silence. This item has no effect on parts of the body other than those listed. The  listed is for a single dose.
