Description

This rich tea can be made from any number of herbs. When the
tea is brewed without a filter and imbibed, the drinker can read
the patterns in the leaves remaining at the bottom of her cup,
gaining the benefits of an augury spell.


Additionally, the unbrewed tea can be used as an extra
material component when casting augury, removing the need
for a focus. In this case, the caster instead reveals information as
if she had cast divination instead.
