Description

This plain black collar is decorated with snowflake obsidian and functions only when worn by a spellcaster's familiar or spirit animal. If the bonded master of a familiar wearing a collar of sacrifice is slain, the collar drains the familiar's life force to restore its master; the familiar is killed instantly and the bonded master is returned to life with 1 hit point. This item does not work if worn by familiars who do not have a physical life force, such as undead or construct familiars.

A familiar that wears a collar of sacrifice becomes despondent and paranoid. It will do nothing except skulk along in the shadows to follow its master. A master must succeed at a DC 15 Charisma check to compel behavior or obedience from such a familiar.
