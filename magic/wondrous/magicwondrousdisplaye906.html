Description

Vanishing wayfinders are crafted of ivory chased with gold and silver. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), the bearer of a vanishing wayfinder can press a hidden catch as a standard action to become invisible (as the spell invisibility) for as long as she concentrates, up to a maximum duration of 5 minutes per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but each activation uses 1 minute of duration, even if the user becomes visible by making an attack or by some other means before that minute is up.
