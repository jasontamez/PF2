Description

When a horse is shod with these horseshoes, they give off a
puff of mist each time a hoof strikes the earth. On the rider's
command, the mount and the rider are both affected as if subject
to a gaseous form spell. If for some reason the rider and the
mount become separated from one another while in gaseous
form, the effect automatically ends for both. The horseshoes
can be used for 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be
consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.
