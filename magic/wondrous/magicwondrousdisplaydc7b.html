Description

This appears to be a typical arrow container
capable of holding about 20 arrows. It has three
distinct portions, each with a nondimensional
space allowing it to store far more than would
normally be possible. The first and smallest
one can contain up to 60 objects of the same
general size and shape as an arrow. The second
slightly longer compartment holds up to 18
objects of the same general size and shape
as a javelin. The third and longest portion of
the case contains as many as 6 objects of the
same general size and shape as a bow (spears,
staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can
quickly produce any item she wishes that is within the quiver, as
if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The efficient quiver weighs
the same no matter what's placed inside it.
