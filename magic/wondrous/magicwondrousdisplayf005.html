Description

These thick, stout boots, crafted from the hide of a gorthek, grant their wearer a +2 enhancement bonus on attack rolls when charging. In addition, once per day when the wearer hits a Large or smaller creature with an attack, he can send his foe flying 10 feet. The foe must be thrown in a straight line away from the wearer, and lands prone at the end of the movement. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.
