Description

Carvings of winter scenes decorate this set of pan pipes.
Activating the pipes requires a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check. Creatures within 30 feet gain a +2 competence bonus
on caster level checks to dispel magical effects and overcome
spell resistance. Maintaining the performance is challenging,
requiring a move action and a new Perform check each round,
with the DC increasing by +1 for each round the instrument is
played. The magic ends when the player voluntarily stops or
fails the Perform check, after which the pipes cannot be used
again for 1 hour.
