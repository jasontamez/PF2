Description

This fine, red leather sheath is decorated with gold filigree. It
fits any bladed slashing weapon. While worn, a scabbard of
stanching protects against bleed damage. Anytime the wearer
suffers a bleed effect, the scabbard automatically stanches it. It
has no effect on bleed damage from effects that require a DC 16
or higher caster level or Heal check.
