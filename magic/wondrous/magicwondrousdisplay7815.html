Description

The Kalistocracy maintains harsh strictures against physical contact with other creatures, but in the thick of battle or by the winds of fate, sometimes contact cannot be avoided. To alleviate the soul taint associated with such contact, the wealthiest Kalistocrats employ magically imbued bathing additives to remove the uncleanliness of outside contact. A single bounteous bath suffusion can be used to fill a bath with enough water for a single Medium or Large creature. A living creature that spends 20 minutes in such a treated bath receives the benefits of both neutralize poison (only the option to neutralize poison affecting the suffusion's user) and remove disease. The bathing creature also gains a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against diseases and poisons for the next 24 hours.
