Description

A solid gold band encircles this intricate convex glass lens. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can attempt an Appraise check against a creature within 60 feet (DC = 10 + target's Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus). With a successful check, the wearer knows the amount of currency the creature is carrying, as well as the number of valuable objects (with a price greater than 20 gp) the target carries (though the wearer doesn't know which items qualify, or the exact value of the objects).

In addition, once per day, the wearer of a marker's monocle can mark one creature with a melee touch attack, allowing up to 3 allies within 30 feet to track the marked creature for 30 minutes, as if the wearer's allies had the scent ability.
