Description

A 60-foot-long rope of climbing is no thicker than a wand, but
it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command,
the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other
direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever
its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same
manner.


A rope of climbing can be commanded to knot or unknot
itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length
until the knots are untied, but lowers the DC of Climb checks
while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope
when its magic is invoked.
