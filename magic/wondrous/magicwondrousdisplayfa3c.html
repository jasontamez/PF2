Description

This wayfinder is constructed of
delicate ivory. Its face constantly
reshapes to form a relief of its bearer,
and is capable of changing as quickly as
two creatures can pass the wayfinder
back and forth. The socket in which an
ioun stone could normally be placed is
instead filled with a permanently fixed
gem that functions as a ring of minor
spell storing. After wielding this wayfinder for 24 hours,
its wielder can designate a series of conditions upon which
the wayfinder will cast the highest-level spell stored in the
gem with the wearer as the spell’s target, as though it were
using the contingency spell. For example, the wielder of a
contingent wayfinder could place a cure moderate wounds
spell in the wayfinder’s gem, then specify that if she ever
falls unconscious because of lethal damage, the spell must
be cast on her.

Once used in such a manner, the wayfinder requires 1 month to
recharge its contingency effect, though a new spell can be cast into
the enclosed gem at any time during this period. If the conditions
of the contingency effect are not met within 1 week of when they
were assigned, the user can change the conditions, though the
spell stored in the gem can’t be changed until it has been cast.
