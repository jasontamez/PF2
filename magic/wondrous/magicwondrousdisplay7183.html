Description

These black leather gloves are lined with
soft black velveteen and have silver
buckles that run from the wrist to the
elbow. Three times per day, the gloves
allow the wearer to treat a ranged magus
spell as a spell with a range of "touch,"
allowing him to deliver the spell with
his spellstrike ability. The glove can only
affect spells that normally affect one
or more creatures at a range greater than "touch" (such as
slow), not rays or other created effects. The altered spell only
affects the creature attacked (any other targets normally
allowed by the spell are lost).
