Description

The wearer of a reaper's mask gains a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks made against creatures that aren't immune to fear and a +1 profane bonus on damage with slashing weapons made against living creatures. The wearer can cast confusion twice per day (DC 16). When a reaper's mask is donned, the wearer takes 1 point of Charisma damage-most Skinsaw cultists don their masks well in advance of a mission so they have time to recover.
