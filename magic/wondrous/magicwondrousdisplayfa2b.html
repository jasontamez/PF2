Description

This simple leather belt pouch can carry a small amount of ordinary gear and objects, as a normal container of its kind. In addition to this ordinary pouch, a black marketeer's bag contains three separate extradimensional spaces, identical in size and function to the smaller side pouches in a handy haversack. Each compartment requires a separate command word to access. A creature that knows the command words can access each hidden compartment without disturbing the contents of the bag itself. A creature opening the black marketeer's bag without first speaking one of the command words sees only the ordinary contents. A black marketeer's bag does not radiate magic (as per magic aura).

When a creature attempts to remove a black marketeer's bag from its bearer without permission, such as with a steal combat maneuver or Sleight of Hand check, the would-be thief must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be compelled to instead place a random item it is holding in its hand (if any) into the bag and then immediately forget the previous round, as per memory lapse.
