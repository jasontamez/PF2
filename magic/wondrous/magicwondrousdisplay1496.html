Description

This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature extremes (as if by endure elements) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all worlds in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship). If the suit's seal is broken'such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink-all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds. A suit with a broken seal confers only the benefits of endure elements. The suit automatically repairs small holes, but if it is struck by a critical hit from a piercing or slashing weapon, the wearer of the pressure suit must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the opponent's confirmation roll) or the seal breaks. A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft (armor) check or a make whole spell. The suit does not compensate for changes in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a -1 armor check penalty; this penalty stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as armor). Since it takes up both the body and helm slots, armor can be worn over a pressure suit, but robes and helms cannot.
