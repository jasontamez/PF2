Description

Preserved sections harvested from several different human
faces cover this mask. When worn, the mask desaturates the
wearer's color, making him appear shadowy and granting a
+5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. Once per day as a
full-round action, the wearer can cause the mask's features to
take on the appearance of any creature of the wearer's basic
size and shape within 60 feet that he observes, allowing the
wearer to adopt that creature's appearance for 1 hour. This
grants him a +10 bonus on Disguise checks made to appear
as the creature. The mask also grants the wearer a +1 bonus
on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls made against the
creature he is disguised as, as the mask builds upon the
wearer's rage and jealousy of the target's appearance.
