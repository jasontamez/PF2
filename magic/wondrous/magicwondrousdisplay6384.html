Description

This headband gives its wearer the gift of foresight,
effectively allowing her to determine whether or not a
particular course of action will grant weal and/or woe.
Three times per day the wearer of this headband can,
as a standard action, gain information about a specified
course of action as if using the augury spell, except that
the wearer always gets a meaningful reply.
