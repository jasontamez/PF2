Description

This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and
3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then
activated by speaking a command word. The same command
word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection
in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature
comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the
original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of
its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction
of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its
items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four
times per day. Destroying the mirror (hardness 1, 5 hit points)
causes all of the duplicates to immediately vanish.
