Description

When placed upon the lips, these thin, translucent sheets of wax melt invisibly onto the user's mouth. The user is aware of-but unaffected by-any magical attacks or effects that might harm him through the lips or mouth (such as a succubus's energy drain attack). In addition, the next time he would be exposed to an ingested poison, the warding lips instead absorb the toxin and leave him unharmed. Once exposed to a magical attack or ingested poison, a set of warding lips loses its magic and becomes useless.
