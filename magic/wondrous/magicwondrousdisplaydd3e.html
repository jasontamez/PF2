Description

These speckled metal gauntlets provide a noticeable prickling sensation when donned. Three times per day when the wearer would take electricity damage, she can attempt a Strength check as an immediate action to catch the electricity and crush it into harmless sparks that deal no damage (DC = 10 + 1 per 10 points of damage).

If the wearer possesses mythic tiers (see Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures), she can also expend one use of her mythic power to reshape the crushed lightning into a variety of forms: blasts of electric force, blinding showers of sparks, or even lassos. This allows the wearer to perform a bull rush, dirty trick, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuver on her next turn against any opponent within range (10 feet per mythic tier she possesses). If the wearer succeeds at this combat maneuver check, her opponent also takes an amount of electricity damage equal to the wearer's combat maneuver check result (up to a maximum of the original electricity effect's damage). Creatures immune to electricity damage are immune to this ability. If the wearer expends the mythic power but doesn't attempt to use the crushed lightning by her next turn, the energy surges out, dealing the original effect's electricity damage to the wearer with no save granted.
