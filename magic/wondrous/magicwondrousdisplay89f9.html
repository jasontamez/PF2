Description

Skill slugs are tiny, segmented parasites incubated primarily in the exposed brains of imprisoned <a href="monsterdisplay6517.html?ItemName=Caulborn">caulborn</a>. Long as a baby's finger and twice as plump, these quivering gastropods draw sustenance from the memory fragments extracted from the caulborn. A measure of those memories lives on within the slug. When consumed, the skill slug grants a +10 competence bonus on a single Intelligence-based skill for 1 hour. Each slug's associated skill is determined at the time of its creation, and cannot be changed. The swallower counts as trained in the skill even if he does not have ranks in it.
