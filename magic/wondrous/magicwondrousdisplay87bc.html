Description

This simple leather mask depicts an earless catlike creature.
When worn, it melds into its wearer's face and vanishes,
leaving the wearer's face just as it looked before. Three times
per day the wearer can command the mask to appear to
retract the wearer's skin, revealing an illusion of the wearer's
glistening skull and musculature. Creatures within 100 feet
who see this display must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or
become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or
shaken (if the target has more than 6 HD) for 1d4 rounds. This
is a mind-affecting fear effect and a glamer. Anyone who can
see through illusions (such as by true seeing) is unaffected.
