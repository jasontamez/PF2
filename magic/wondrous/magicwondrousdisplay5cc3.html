Description

Contrary to the name, a blasphemous chalice takes the form of an enchanted box, usually sumptuously decorated, with a lump of unidentifiable tissue inside. This tissue seems to somehow be alive and bleeds a watery, greenish-black blood.

To benefit from the chalice's power, a character must bite the tissue and drink the blood as a full-round action. The alien blood twists and rearranges the character's organs. For the next hour, when the affected creature is hit by a critical hit or a sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. A blasphemous chalice produces enough blood for a single use per day.
