Description

This amulet consists of a cracked dragon scale set in a
disk of gold. Most are slightly damaged, bearing the scars
of draconic breath weapons. The dragonfoe amulet is a
powerful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons,
improving the protection and attacks of the wearer in a
number of ways.


The wearer of a dragonfoe amulet ignores the damage
reduction of dragons. This only affects actual dragons, not all
creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a
spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell
resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result.
Lastly, the wearer takes no damage instead of half damage on
a successful Reflex save against a dragon's breath weapon (as
the evasion ability).
