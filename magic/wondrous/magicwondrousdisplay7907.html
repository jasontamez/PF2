Description

The wielder may throw this small, dense iron sphere as a ranged touch attack (with a 10-foot range increment) or use it as a sling bullet. Upon striking a solid object, a caltrop bead explodes into caltrops in a 10-foot-radius burst. A creature directly hit by a caltrop bead takes 2d4 points of piercing damage, and adjacent creatures take 1d4 points of damage as the bead suddenly bursts. Caltrops created by a caltrop bead remain for 1 hour before disappearing.
