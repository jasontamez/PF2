Description

Ants occasionally crawl in and out of the numerous tiny holes dotting these sturdy, thick-soled boots. The boots' wearer receives a +4 competence bonus on Fortitude saving throws against swarms' distraction ability. Additionally, once per day, the wearer can call forth a swarm of army ants as a standard action. This functions as the spell vomit swarm, except the swarm crawls out from the boots instead of being vomited forth. The swarm lasts for 13 rounds before dissipating.
