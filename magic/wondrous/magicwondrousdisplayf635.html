Description

This eyewear consists of two thick, gold-rimmed glass lenses encased in a leather band. When worn over the eyes, a pair of discerning goggles allows you to determine creatures' alignments with a single look. Good creatures appear to faintly glow blue and evil creatures to faintly glow red. Neutral-aligned creatures appear normal, as do creatures under the effect of an undetectable alignment spell or similar effect. These goggles function only during times when you normally would possess sight; for example, they do not work in darkness unless you possess darkvision.
