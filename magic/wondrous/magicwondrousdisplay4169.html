Description

This metal urn is identical in appearance to an efreeti bottle,
except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke
is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle
and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1
round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows
out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot
radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the eversmoking
bottle is stoppered.


The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after
which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+
mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+
mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.
