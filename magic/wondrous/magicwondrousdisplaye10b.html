Description

This mantle grants the wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving
throws against disease. Once per day, the wearer can flourish
the cape as a swift action to surround himself with a cloud of
deadly spores. Creatures adjacent to the wearer take 1d6 points
of damage from the spores, plus 1d3 points of damage per round
for 3 rounds as the spores grow into fuzzy green mold. After
these rounds the mold becomes harmless, and can be washed
away with a minute of scrubbing. The spores can be destroyed
by making a DC 15 Heal check on an affected creature, or by
effects that remove diseases. The spores are a disease effect.
