Description

This spiraling animal horn can be
sounded as a normal horn, but if
the command word is spoken and
the instrument is then played, it
deals 5d6 points of sonic damage
to creatures within a 40-foot cone
and causes them to be deafened
for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage
by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects
and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage, with no
save unless they're held, worn, or carried by creatures
(Fortitude DC 16 negates).


If a horn of blasting is used magically more than once in a
given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use
that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to the
person sounding it.
