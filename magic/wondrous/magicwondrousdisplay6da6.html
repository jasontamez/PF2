Description

This item appears to be a string or
cluster of spherical beads, sometimes
with the ends tied together to form a
necklace. (It does not count as an item
worn around the neck for the purpose
of determining which of a character's
worn magic items is effective.) If a
character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really
is-a golden chain from which hang a number of golden
spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only
by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet.
When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates
as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half).

Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that
deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price
of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.

spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations,
designated types I through VII, are detailed above.

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails
her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make
a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace
fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously,
often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.
