Description

This cube functions exactly like a cube of force except that each wall of the cube can be activated independently and can even have different effects. For example, one wall can block living matter, another wall can block magic, and a third can keep out gases, while the other sides are open without any protection. Activating each wall costs the price of activating that effect for an entire standard cube of force-for instance, one wall against magic and one wall against living matter cost a total of 7 charges per minute.
