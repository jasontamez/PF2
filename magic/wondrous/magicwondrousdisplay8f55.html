Description

This jagged steel crown is rough and scratched but shows no sign of being dented or misshapen. Once per day, the wearer can issue a challenge to a creature able to see and hear him. The creature gains a +2 morale bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls against the crown's wearer for 1 minute. The creature challenged also takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls against all targets other than the wearer, and takes a -2 penalty to the save DCs of its spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that affect other targets unless they also affect the wearer of the crown. These penalties last 1 minute or until the creature challenged makes a melee attack against the wearer of the crown.

If the crown's wearer has the challenge class feature, he gains the benefit of his challenge against the creature challenged without expending a daily use of his own challenge ability.
