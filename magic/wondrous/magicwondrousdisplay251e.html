Description

On command, this ornate Qadiran hooded lantern lights itself with a continual flame or extinguishes itself. Once per day when holding the lantern, the user can speak a command word to use bless. If placed on a sturdy surface and another command word is spoken, it activates a consecrate effect, though this effect immediately ends if the lantern is moved or its light is extinguished.
