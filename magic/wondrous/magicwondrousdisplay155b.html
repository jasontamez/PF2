Description

This peculiar idol, carved from some unknown green stone, depicts a seven-legged octopoid figure with a horribly grinning face. Also known as the Seasage Effigy, the Face of Dagon is a sacred relic of the ulat-kini. The bearer of the idol can breathe water (as the water breathing spell) as long as it is in her possession. In addition, the bearer can cast commune once per week to contact Dagon or one of the Great Old Ones or Outer Gods. Each time the Face of Dagon is used in this way, however, the bearer must make a DC 20 Will save or suffer insanity (as the spell) as her mind is opened to the horrors of beyond.
