Description

This large container is usually fashioned
from silver with a rippled pattern. It is
about 1 foot in diameter and half that
deep. The bowl must be filled with fresh
or salt water to function. On command as
a full-round action, the bearer may summon a water elemental.
If the bowl is filled with salt water, it conjures a Huge water
elemental as if using summon monster VI. If filled with fresh
water, it conjures a Large water elemental as if using summon
monster V. Conjuring an elemental empties the bowl. The bowl
cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is
dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.
