Description

This beautiful and intricately carved
harp can be held comfortably in one
hand, but both hands are required to
utilize its magic. When played, a harp
of charming enables the performer to
work one suggestion (as the spell, Will
DC 14 negates) into the music for each
10 minutes of playing if she can succeed
on a DC 14 Perform (string) check. If
the check fails, the audience cannot be affected by any further
performances from the harpist for 24 hours.
