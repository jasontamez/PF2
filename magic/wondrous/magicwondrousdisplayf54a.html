Description

This macabre lantern is composed of a humanoid skull
dangling from a short length of chain. A small fragment
of soulstuff is trapped inside, burning slowly in a heatless
flame. Its flickering light shines from the skull's eye sockets,
casting light as a bullseye lantern. On command, the lantern
can consume its soulstuff in a sudden blast of heat, as
burning hands. Doing so extinguishes the lantern. Whenever
a living creature with at least 1 HD is slain within 30 feet of
an empty grim lantern, the lantern absorbs a fragment of
that creature's soul, restoring its glow.
