Description

This black iron choker chain forges a link between the wearer and any undead creature of the wearer's choice. Creating this link requires a command word. The wearer can dismiss this bond with another command word, and reforge it with the same or a different undead creature at a later time. While the two are bound and within 100 feet of one another, any positive energy damage the undead would take is instead transferred to the wearer as healing. Likewise, any negative energy damage the wearer would take transfers to and heals the undead. The collar can transfer up to 70 total points of damage per day.
