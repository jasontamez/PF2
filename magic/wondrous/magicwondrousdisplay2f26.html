Description

This black-and-gray wool coat sports over a dozen pockets on its front alone and even more line the insides. Interdimensional magic causes anything placed in one pocket to immediately appear in another randomly determined pocket. A character wearing this coat gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to hide a small object on her body. However, if a character wearing a coat of pockets places anything in one of the coat's pockets, she must spend a standard action to retrieve it (rather than a move action).
