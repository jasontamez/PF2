Description

This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster is a
potent aid to all spellcasters who prepare spells. Once per day on
command, a pearl of power enables the possessor to recall any
one spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell
is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell
must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl. Different
pearls exist for recalling one spell per day of each level from 1st
through 9th and for the recall of two spells per day (each of a
different level, 6th or lower).
