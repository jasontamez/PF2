Description

This fine dust causes bare skin that it comes in contact with to burn and tingle. When sprinkled on a corpse or an inanimate skeleton, it causes the dead flesh and bones to disintegrate into a fine brown powder similar to that left by a disintegrate spell. Assassin's dust comes in a small vial suitable for treating eight Small corpses, four Medium corpses, or one Large corpse. A skeletal corpse counts as half a corpse of its size. This dust has no effect on living or undead creatures.
