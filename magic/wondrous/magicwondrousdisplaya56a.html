Description

This ponderous book details suggestions for persuading and
inspiring others, but entwined within the words is a powerful
magical effect. If anyone reads this book, which takes a total of
48 hours over a minimum of 6 days, he gains an inherent bonus
from +1 to +5 (depending on the type of tome) to his Charisma
score. Once the book is read, the magic disappears from the
pages and it becomes a normal book.
