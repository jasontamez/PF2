Description

This plume always bears ink, as though freshly drawn from an inkwell. Once per day, a character holding the quill can enter a trancelike state, automatically writing possible upcoming events. After 1 minute of uninterrupted writing, the writer chooses attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. The next time that day she attempts a roll of the chosen type, she rolls twice and takes the more favorable result. The next time that day she attempts a roll of one of the other types (for example, a saving throw or skill check if she initially chose attack roll), she must roll twice and take the less favorable result.
