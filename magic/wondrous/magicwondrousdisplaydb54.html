Description

A shadow stylus can create a doorway between the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane. To do so, the user must prick a bit of skin with the stylus's pointed end, anointing it with a drop of blood from a living creature. The user must then use the shadowy chalk held in the stylus's other end to inscribe a doorway on a solid surface in an area of dim light. Doing so requires 1d4 rounds of work and, once completed, fashions a portal like that created by a <a href="spelldisplay756d.html?ItemName=gate">gate</a> spell, linking the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane. The destinations on both planes must overlap-to create a portal to Shadow Absalom, for example, the user would have to create the doorway from the Material Plane in Absalom. The portal created closes 1 minute after it is created.

As long as a creature carries a shadow stylus on her person, she gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells of the shadow subschool and against all special attacks created by <a href="monsterfamilies2ecb.html?ItemName=Kyton">kytons</a>, <a href="monsterdisplay372c.html?ItemName=Shadow">shadows</a>, and other creatures native to the Shadow Plane. In addition, the character can see on the Shadow Plane as if that realm were brightly lit. A shadow stylus has 6 uses when it is created. Once it is used to create a sixth portal, the stylus loses its ability to craft new portals but retains its protective qualities.
