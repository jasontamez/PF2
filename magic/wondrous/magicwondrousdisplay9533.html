Description

With an exterior crafted of blackened iron, the wayfinder of spellbreaking has no ornamentation. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), a wayfinder of spellbreaking can be used once per day to create a dispel magic effect on a creature or object. The wayfinder of spellbreaking must be touched to the object-targeting an unwilling creature requires a successful melee touch attack. If the user has detect magic active or can otherwise observe magical auras, he can target a specific aura; otherwise, the wayfinder of spellbreaking targets the effect with the highest caster level.
