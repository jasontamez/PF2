Description

This black jacket is marked with the insignia of the Blackjackets. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to gain spell resistance 20 for 3 rounds. This spell resistance ends if the wearer successfully resists a spell as a result of it failing to penetrate his spell resistance. The first time each day that a spell has no effect on the wearer because of spell resistance or a successful saving throw, the jacket becomes charged with abjuration magic and its insignia glows faintly. The wearer can touch the glowing insignia as a standard action to cast dispel magic from the jacket, expending the charge. The charge fades with no effect if unused for 1 hour.
