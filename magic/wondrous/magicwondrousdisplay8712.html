Description

An ember glow lights the beady eyes
of this blackened, burned out goblin's
skull. It is very brittle and shatters if
dropped on solid ground. When a
goblin skull bomb breaks, the very
last creature to touch it bursts into a
raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of
fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save
(DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one
round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's
blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new goblin skull
bomb. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or
if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it
does not create a new goblin skull bomb.


A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a
range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull
shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the
attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another
nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame.
Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld
items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the
skull. It can be safely moved using spells (such as mage
hand or telekinesis) or attacked with ranged weapons
(hardness 0, 1 hp).
