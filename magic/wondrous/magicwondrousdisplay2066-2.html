Description

This heart-shaped charm is set with three pearls: one
white, one silver, and one black. Inside, a tiny compartment
usually contains smelling salts (page 101) or alchemist's
kindness (page 100). Each pearl has a primary, passive
ability and a secondary, active ability that activates if it
is removed from the setting and swallowed (a standard
action, as if drinking a potion). Swallowing a pearl destroys
it. A command word activates the primary abilities of all
three pearls for 1 round.


When activated, the white pearl detects poison in a 10-
foot radius around the wearer, dulling to a dark gray if poison
is within range. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a delay
poison spell.


The silver pearl detects diseases in a 10-foot radius, turning
bright blue on discovery. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of
a remove disease spell.


The black pearl turns white if any invisible creature is within
10 feet of the wearer. If swallowed, it grants the benefits of
see invisibility for 1 minute.


A charms found with missing pearls has its price reduced
appropriately; a white pearl is worth 750 gp, a silver pearl is
worth 1,150 gp, and black pearl is worth 1,700 gp.
