Description

These magic items are usually crafted as lutes, though they can be fashioned as other instruments. On command three times per day, the lute can transform into a +1 spear, +1 longsword, or +1 battleaxe. The type of the weapon the instrument transforms into must be chosen at creation, and the weapon must be appropriately sized for the user of the instrument. The instrument takes weapon form for 1 minute, or until its wielder uses another command word to transform it back to its normal form.
