Description

This elbow-length scaled metal gauntlet flares at the wrist
like a cobra’s hood. Up to three times per day, the wearer
way transform the gauntlet into an iron cobra (Bestiary
182), which crawls from the wearer’s wrist and obeys his
commands, leaving behind a simple bracelet of linked scales.
Whoever wears the bracelet is the iron cobra’s master. The
iron cobra can remain animated for a total of 1 hour per day.


If the snake is within hearing range of the master and
commanded to revert to gauntlet form (a standard action),
it travels to its master as fast as possible, crawls onto its
master’s arm, and as a free action reverts to its inactive
shape. If the snake’s duration expires before it can reach its
master, it reverts to gauntlet form, but automatically melds
with the bracelet if the two touch.


If slain in cobra form, the snake reverts to gauntlet form
and cannot be used again for 24 hours. If destroyed in
gauntlet form, the item is destroyed. The wearer can refill the
iron cobra’s poison reservoir in snake form or gauntlet form.
