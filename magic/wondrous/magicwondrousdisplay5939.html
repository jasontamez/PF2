Description

A sniper’s helmet looks like the
simple steel soldier’s helmet
common to the European trenches
of the First World War, with the
addition of a steel eye shield. Once
per day, the wearer of a sniper’s helmet can, as a standard action, denote one creature within
her line of sight as her target. The wearer can perceive the
target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the
see invisibility spell, and gains a +20 competence bonus on
Perception checks to locate the target. The wearer ignores
concealment provided by fog or mist, blur, displacement,
invisibility, and similar effects affecting the target, but not
concealment provided by darkness. These bonuses last for
5 minutes or until the target creature is dead. The sniper’s
helmet provides no benefits to the wearer’s allies, and the
wearer gains no benefits against creatures other than her
chosen target.

In addition, once per day, the wearer of a sniper’s helmet
can create a magical sensor up to 600 feet above her that
gives her a full 360-degree viewpoint as if she were actually
there. The wearer perceives with her normal visual senses,
and though the sensor cannot penetrate solid surfaces, it is
unaffected by foliage and the like.
