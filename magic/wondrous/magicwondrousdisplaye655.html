Description

This black velvet eye patch is attached to an onyx chain that is worn around the head. The eye patch grants its wearer darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Additionally, as a standard action, the wearer can speak the eye patch's command word to see through powerful magical darkness, such as an area of deeper darkness, for up to 11 minutes per day. This duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Ending this effect is a free action.
