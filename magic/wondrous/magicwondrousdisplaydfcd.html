Description

This set of cold iron gauntlets has pistons, gears, and hinges connecting all the joints and plates. As a swift action, the wearer can command one or both of the gauntlets to lock into position or unlock and move normally. If a gauntlet locks while holding a weapon, it acts as a locked gauntlet, providing the wearer a +10 bonus to his Combat Maneuver Defense against being disarmed. Locking the gauntlets also grants the wearer a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to pin a grappled foe and Climb checks to catch himself while falling. They can also allow other uses at the GM's discretion, such as hanging from a ledge or similar position without having to attempt a Climb check or becoming fatigued.
