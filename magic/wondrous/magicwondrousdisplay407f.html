Description

Embroidered with images of falling stars
and pale moons, this item appears to be a
normal cloak, but on command its magical
properties distort and warp light waves.
This displacement works just like the
displacement spell and lasts for a total of
15 rounds per day, which the wearer can
divide up as she sees fit.
