Description

This gruesome lantern is made from bone and emerald-tinted glass. When lit, it shines a disgusting green dim light in a 60-foot radius. This light makes living creatures uncomfortable, but does them no harm.

A lit necromancer's beacon attracts undead creatures within 1,000 feet, whether they can see it or not. Sentient undead must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid this effect, and mindless undead receive no saving throw. Any undead creature attracted by a necromancer's beacon must move as fast as it is able toward the lantern; once it comes within 60 feet of the lantern, the undead creature can act normally (unintelligent undead usually attempt to destroy the lantern). This effect is blocked by 1 foot of wood, 1 inch of stone, or a thin layer of lead. An intelligent undead that succeeds at its saving throw against a necromancer's beacon is forever immune to the effects of that particular necromancer's beacon.

Undead creatures take 1 point of positive energy damage every round they remain within the light shed by a necromancer's beacon. If the lantern is destroyed, all undead are immediately freed from the lantern's compulsion.
