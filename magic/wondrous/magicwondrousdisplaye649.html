Description

Traders crossing Casmaron's Grass Sea often carry a small, eagle-shaped caravan guardian with them on their journeys. These wooden statuettes serve as watchful guardians, alerting travelers when there is danger and summoning an eagle ally to fight the threat. Each day, the guardian's wielder must designate up to five allies, including himself, to be alerted of an intruder's presence. When a creature approaches within 20 feet of an unattended caravan guardian (or its wielder, if a creature has the guardian on their person), that creature must speak the command word within 1 round or an eagle appears in a space next to the statue and attacks whatever creature triggered it. Additionally, the caravan guardian sends all designated creatures a mental warning, as per the mental alarm use of the alarm spell (if the guardian's wielder did not designate allies to be alerted that day, the item alerts the most recently designated allies). If there is no appropriate space for the eagle to be summoned into, it does not appear, but the caravan guardian still sends a mental alarm. A caravan guardian can summon only one eagle per day.
