Description

Usually stored in a jar shaped like a scarab beetle, this unguent is pale green and smells like thistle with a hint of the scent of embalming fluids. A jar contains five applications, each of which can be applied as a full-round action.

When applied to an afflicted area or swallowed, the ointment removes a single curse or restores ability damage caused by an undead's special attack (such as a shadow's touch). This ointment otherwise acts as per lesser restoration or remove curse with a +5 bonus on the check. Unlike normal applications of remove curse, purifying ointment can potentially remove an affliction that is both a curse and disease (such as mummy rot), though that requires two successful caster level checks.
