Description

This black leather cord has a red wooden ball attached at its center. When the cord is tied around a creature's head and the wooden ball is placed in the creature's mouth, the creature cannot speak or make any vocal sounds, including verbal components of spells. When removed from the creature, the ball breaks off from the leather cord, ending the effect. A creature that is not otherwise restrained can easily untie the gag and remove it.
