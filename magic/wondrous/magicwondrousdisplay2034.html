Description

This oily bronze helm is fashioned in the shape of a frog's
head. Three times per day as a swift action, the helm fires
an unerring tongue of force at a visible target within 20 feet.


If the target is an unattended object weighing 250 pounds
or less, it is pulled 20 feet toward the wearer. If the target
is a creature of the wearer's size or smaller, the wearer may
make a combat maneuver check as a free action to pull the
target 20 feet toward him.


If the target is a creature larger than the wearer, an
unattended object weighing more than 250 pounds, or an
immobile structure such as a wall, the wearer is pulled 20
feet toward the target. This movement does not provoke
attacks of opportunity, and the object or creature stops if the
movement would move it into a solid object or creature.
