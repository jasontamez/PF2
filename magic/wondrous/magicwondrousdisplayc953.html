Description

These magical sets of clothing can take many forms. In Segada, notable examples range from the ornate costumes of the Festival of Flowers to the flamboyant, birdlike costumes of the Waning Light Festival. When a wearer of a festival garment dances, he can get onlookers into a festive, celebratory mood. A wearer of a festival garment can attempt a Perform (dance) check instead of a Diplomacy check to influence the attitude of a humanoid creature, but only if the creature's initial attitude is unfriendly or better. In addition, if the wearer is at a festival or celebration, he gains a +5 competence bonus on Perform (dance) checks.
