Description

This silver, oval-shaped platter can hold up to 1 cubic foot worth of food. Once per day, the platter's user can activate the item to transform its contents into another type or quality of food of the user's choosing. The transformed food looks and smells just like actual food of its new type, but retains its original texture, taste, nourishment, and level of fulfillment. Spoiled or poisoned food remains so and is detectable as such under magical or supernatural scrutiny.
