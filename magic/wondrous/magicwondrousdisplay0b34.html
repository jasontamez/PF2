Description

This slender silver crown is
decorated with a single cat's
eye gemstone as a centerpiece.
When the gem is attached to
the crown, its wearer gains
darkvision 60 feet, or increases her darkvision by 60 feet
if she already possesses that sense. The gemstone is
detachable, and can be rolled into rooms, dropped into holes,
thrown through windows, or planted on a creature. Once per
day, on command, the crown's wearer gains the benefit of
the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell, but uses the cat's eye
gemstone as that spell's sensor and gains darkvision when
viewing through that sensor. If the stone is held or carried by
a creature, even within a sack or some other container, the
creature wearing the crown uses the senses of the creature
carrying the gemstone as the sensor instead, whether or not
the creature carrying the gemstone is aware of the stone's true
purpose or even its existence. Destroying the gem (hardness
8, hp 5) severs the link, but a new cat's eye gemstone worth
at least 100 gp can be fashioned and attuned to the crown.
The attunement process takes 24 hours.
