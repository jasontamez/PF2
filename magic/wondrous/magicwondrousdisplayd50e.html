Description

This intimidating mantle of gold and silver is set with several large gems, which seem to change in cut and type of stone every time it's viewed. The wearer of this mantle always appears to be clean, uninjured, and calm, granting him a +5 bonus on Diplomacy checks. Also, once per day as a standard action, the wearer can bellow a single word in a thundering, imperious tone. This functions as the spell shout, and the word can be heard by any creature within 200 feet. If this word is one of the five orders detailed by the spell command, in addition to the effects of shout, all creatures within 25 feet must make a DC 16 Will save or be affected as if by the spell command. Those damaged by shout take a -4 penalty on this Will save.
