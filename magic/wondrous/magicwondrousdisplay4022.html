Description

While most objects'such as ancient trinkets and jewelry- sold as purported belongings of a Lung Wa emperor have no actual magical value, some do have magical properties. Such items all function much the same way, despite taking a variety of shapes and being attributed to different emperors. Whatever its origin and form, a relic of a virtuous emperor can be used to cast augury three times per day. It can also be used to summon one kodama or 1d4+1 shikigami as if they had been summoned by summon nature's ally V, once per day. Additionally, anyone in possession of a relic of a virtuous emperor gains a +1 insight bonus to AC.
