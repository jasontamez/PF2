Description

This cloak appears to be made of
leather until the wearer enters salt
water. At that time, the cloak of the
manta ray adheres to the individual,
and he appears nearly identical to
a manta ray (as the beast shape
II spell, except that it allows only
manta ray form). He gains a +3
natural armor bonus, the ability to breathe underwater, and
a swim speed of 60 feet, like a real manta ray.


The cloak also allows the wearer to attack with a sting
ray's tail spine, dealing 1d6 points of damage. This attack
can be used in addition to any other attack the character has,
using his highest melee attack bonus. The wearer can release
his arms from the cloak without sacrificing underwater
movement if so desired.
