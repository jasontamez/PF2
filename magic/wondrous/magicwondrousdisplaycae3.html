Description

This pale leather vest's surface is decorated with a web of veinlike ridges. Once per day as an immediate action when you are struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, your shed blood or flesh coagulates into a short-lived guardian that appears in any adjacent square and follows your commands. This guardian has all the abilities of a homunculus, except that its type is undead. If the triggering attack inflicted bleed damage, the homunculus also gains the giant simple template. This homunculus lasts for 7 rounds before melting, and it doesn't deal damage to you when it's destroyed.
