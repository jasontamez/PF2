Description

This mithral helm has a faceplate resembling a frost giant's face, complete with a beard formed from layered, thin metal rods. While wearing a Thremyr's beard, a creature gains a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate a frost giant or svathurim (though the helm does nothing to increase the wearer's size).

Once per day as an immediate action after being successfully hit by a melee weapon, the wearer of a lesser Thremyr's beard can order the helm to animate, whereupon the thin metal rods of the helm's beard reach out to grasp the weapon. This functions as a disarm combat maneuver that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

A lesser Thremyr's beard has a CMB of +23; the wearer can use the helm's CMB or her own CMB, whichever is higher.

A greater Thremyr's beard functions identically to the lesser version, but offers more protection for the wearer's vulnerable neck. Once per day as an immediate action after a critical hit is confirmed against the wearer with a melee weapon, the wearer can force the attacker to reroll the confirmation roll and take the worse result.
