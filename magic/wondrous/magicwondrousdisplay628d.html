Aura faint enchantment; CL 2nd
Slot none; Price 7,000 gp; Weight 1 lb.

Description

This bright red garment bestows no benefit when worn on
the shoulders, but when held in one hand while draped
over the arm, the cape obscures its user's movements
in combat. Used this way, the cape bestows a +1 insight
bonus to AC and a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks
to feint in combat. Readying the cape in combat is a move
action; if the wielder has a base attack bonus of +1 or
higher, the wielder can ready the cape as a free action as
part of movement.


Once per day as an immediate action, a creature brandishing a
cape of bravado may attempt to compel an opponent within 30
feet to attack him on its next turn (Will negates DC 11).
