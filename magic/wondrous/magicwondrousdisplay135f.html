Description

Comprised of thick iron links, the carcanet of detention is
commonly worn by prison guards and elite members of the city
watch. Once per day, the wearer of the carcanet may command it
to animate and attempt to wrap around one Medium or smaller
creature within 15 feet. The target receives a DC 15 Reflex saving
throw to avoid the chain. If the saving throw fails, the target is
entangled and cannot move from its current location. As a fullround
action, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end
the effect; otherwise it persists for 10 minutes or until ended
by the wearer as a swift action, at which point it returns to its
carcanet form. The chain has a hardness of 10 and 15 hit points.
