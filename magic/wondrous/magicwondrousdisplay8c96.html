Description

Made from a single male lion's coat with the
mane surrounding its hood, the lion cloak is
an impressive sight. A creature wearing the
cloak gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving
throws made against mind-affecting and
fear effects and a +2 circumstance bonus on
Intimidate checks. Once per day, the wearer
can pull the hood over her head, assuming
the form of a lion (as the beast shape II spell, except that it
allows only lion form) for up to 10 minutes. If the wearer has
the smite class feature, she can use this power more than
once per day by expending uses of her smite; at most she can
take the lion form as many times as she has smites plus one
additional time. While in this lion form the wearer cannot use
its normal smite ability.
