Description

Crafted from a preserved rust monster antenna, this item works similarly to a gauntlet of rust, with the exceptions that you can make a rusting grasp touch attack with the whip at will, you can use it on all nonmagical metallic objects (not just ferrous ones), and it does not protect you from other rusting attacks. This item counts as a whip for the purposes of proficiency and weapon feats.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, rusting grasp; Cost 28,000 gp (24,000 gp if deceased rust monster is provided), 2,240 XP
