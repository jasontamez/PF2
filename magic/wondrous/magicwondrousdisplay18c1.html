Description

This magical instrument is usually made of
gold and inlaid with numerous gems. If the
proper chords are struck, a single use of
this lyre negates any attacks made against
inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor,
and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the
effects of a horn of blasting, a disintegrate
spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege
weapon. The lyre can be used in this way
once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.


The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a
week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords
that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches,
etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal
to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour
after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 Perform (string instruments) check. If she fails, she must
stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a
week has passed.
