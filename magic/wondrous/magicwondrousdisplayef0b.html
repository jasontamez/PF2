Description

This alabaster sphere, overlaid with golden bands set with
diamonds in runelike patterns, sheds light like a continual
flame spell. Making a melee touch attack with the orb
has the same effect as dousing the target with a flask of
holy water. A good creature may hold the orb in hand and
command it to invoke consecrate and searing light each
once per day.


The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any
evil creature holding or carrying it. The negative level
remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears
immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This
negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including
by restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb. If the
bearer of an orb of golden heaven wears a crown of golden
heaven, its light counts as daylight instead of continual
flame, and its consecrate acts as if the orb were a shrine to
the bearer's deity.
