Description

This brightly colored banner measures 2 feet by 4 feet in
size, and is mounted on an 8-foot-long pole of spiraled gold
and ivory. When the commander of an army engaged in mass
combat displays this banner, the army under her command is
treated as knowing one additional tactic. The granted tactic
must be selected at the time of the banner's creation and
cannot be changed. The army must be able to see the banner
in a given phase of mass combat to receive the bonus; a banner
is considered obscured in conditions of darkness, fog, and
sandstorms. If the commander is killed or captured, the banner
ceases to function, even if it remains visible in the commander's
absence. A commander may have a number of banners in effect
equal to her Charisma modifier; if more banners are displayed
than her Charisma modifier allows, roll randomly each round to
determine which banners' abilities are suppressed.

Banner of Tactical Command, Lesser: This functions as a banner of tactical command but can only
affect armies of size Large or smaller.
