Description

This item is a flask of syrupy fluid with an eyeball floating in it.
When a creature drinks the entire flask, 1d4 rounds later he is
stunned for 1 round as 1d4+1 floating fish with large eyes for
heads crawl out of his flesh. Once these eye-fish free themselves,
they hover near the drinker, always staying in the drinker's
square, and otherwise function as the eyes from a prying eyes
spell, except they are Tiny rather than Fine. As long as the
drinker has at least three of the fish in his square, he gains a
+10 competence bonus on sight-based Perception checks. Every
1d6 ?? 10 minutes, 1d4+1 more eye-fish crawl out of his flesh,
stunning him for 1 round each time. Each flask can produce up
to 1d4+10 fish total; once this many have appeared, no more are
created. The fish remain until they are destroyed or until 10 hours
pass from the time the flask was used.
