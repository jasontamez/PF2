Description

This silver charm bracelet has four
charms upon it when created. The
owner may designate one person
known to him to be keyed to each
charm. (This designation takes a
standard action, but once done
it lasts forever or until changed.) When a charm is grasped
and the name of the keyed individual is spoken, that person is
called to the spot (a standard action) appearing at the user's
location along with his gear, as long as the bracelets's owner
and the called person are on the same plane. The keyed
individual knows who is attempting to teleport him, and the
bracelet of friends only functions on willing travelers. Once a
charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the
bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four
charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.
