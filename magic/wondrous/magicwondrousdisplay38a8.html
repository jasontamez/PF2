Description

When lit, this hooded lantern shines brightly in a 60-foot radius, as daylight. Once per day as a swift action, if the owner worships Sarenrae or is a good-aligned divine spellcaster, she can intensify the lantern's light for 1 hour. This intensified light dazzles evil outsiders and undead in the area, and evil incorporeal creatures take 75% damage from magical attacks instead of 50%. If an illuminated creature or object has a mark indicating evil allegiance'such as a demoniac's demonic mark (see page 46 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2)-that mark glow brilliantly, shining through anything short of magical concealments.
