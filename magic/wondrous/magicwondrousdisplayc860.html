Description

This ornate sash of embroidered velvet stretches across the
chest from shoulder to waist. If the wearer is an inquisitor,
she is treated as five levels higher when using her bane
and greater bane abilities. If the wearer is not an inquisitor,
she gains the bane ability of a 5th-level inquisitor, but
must first attune a light or one-handed melee weapon to
the baldric by hanging it from the cloth for 24 hours, and
can only use the bane ability with the attuned weapon.
Attuning a new weapon to the baldric ends the attunement
for the previous weapon.
