Description

This leather half-mask covers the wearer's nose and mouth, obscuring her lip movements but not her voice. Creatures that are on their native plane and have a language understand all words spoken by the wearer, as though her words were spoken in the listening creature's native tongue. In addition, because the mask replicates local idioms efficiently and skillfully, the wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks and on Bluff checks to tell a lie. A mask of the far traveler does not function on the Material Plane.
