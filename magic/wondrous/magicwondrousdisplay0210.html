Description

This thin, bleached cloth covers the wearer's entire torso.
Some also cover the wearer's face, but don't interfere with
the wearer's vision. The morbid burial shroud grants the
wearer some affinity with the spectral dead. The wearer can
discern invisible or ethereal creatures as though using see
invisibility. Once per day, the wearer can become incorporeal
for 10 rounds and gain a fly speed equal to half his base speed
with perfect maneuverability. The wearer can't attack while
incorporeal, but can dismiss the effect as a move action.
