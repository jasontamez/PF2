Description

This wayfinder is crafted from
polished gold and when viewed
in bright light is highly reflective-
resembling a mirror more than it
does simple metal. A truthseeker
wayfinder allows the wielder to cast
zone of truth for up to 7 minutes per day (Will DC 14 negates).
This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used
in 1-minute increments. If a creature saves against this effect
once, it is immune to the effect for 24 hours. Creatures that
fail their saves are granted a new save each time the effect
is activated anew. Once per day, the wielder of a truthseeker
wayfinder can gain the benefits of discern lies for up to 7
rounds (Will DC 16 negates). When the truthseeker wayfinder
senses the target creature issue an intentional falsehood, it
vibrates just enough to be perceptible to the wielder but no
one else.
