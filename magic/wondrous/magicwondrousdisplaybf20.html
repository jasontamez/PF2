Description

These thin leather gloves have delicate steel wires running
through them. Three times per day as a standard action,
the wearer of these gloves may attempt a disarm combat
maneuver on a target within 30 feet. The target's item must
be mostly made of metal. If the combat maneuver check
is successful, the target is disarmed and the item falls to
the ground in the target's square. For every 5 by which the
check exceeds the DC, the item lands 1 square closer to the
wearer. If this would place the item in the wearer's square,
the wearer may attempt to catch the item with a DC 10
Dexterity check; otherwise it lands in the wearer's square.
The wearer can only use this ability if she has at least one
hand free. If the wearer fails the combat maneuver check,
she is not disarmed.
