Description

This amulet functions as a periapt of devotion but has a Will save DC of 16 and can affect nonhumanoids (as per charm monster). In addition, once per day when talking to the wearer, the giver can implant a triggered suggestion in the wearer's mind, as per the spell. The wearer can attempt a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. If he surpasses the DC by 5 or more, he also breaks the periapt's charm effect.
