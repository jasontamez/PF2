Description

Made of twisted copper wire braided into a torc with redstained dog paws at its ends, a thundering collar is so named after Cayden Cailean's faithful red mastiff, Thunder. A thundering collar allows the wearer to issue a rumbling growl that sounds like rolling thunder three times per day. Creatures within 15 feet must succeed at a DC 12 Will save to attack (as if affected by sanctuary). The wielder can bestow the effect on one adjacent ally as well. This effect lasts for 3 rounds or until the wearer or its ally attacks.
