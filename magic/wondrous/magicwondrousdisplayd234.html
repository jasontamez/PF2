Description

A hex nail is a thick, 6-inch-long nail forged from cold iron. Usually carried like charms or concealed within the heels of shoes, these roughly worked nails are the only protection many common citizens of Irrisen have against the White Witches and the cold fey of the North. Carrying a hex nail grants its possessor a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against the hexes, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of fey, hags, and witches. A hex nail automatically grants its bonus when its possessor is targeted by such an effect. Once a hex nail has granted its bonus on a single saving throw, it becomes a nonmagical nail. Most Jadwiga consider possession of a hex nail an act of treason.
