Description

Once affixed, this ancient ankh bonds seamlessly to the hilt or handle of any magic melee weapon. The ankh's power remains dormant until you fall in battle-unconscious, dead, or dying. At that point, the ankh animates the weapon, enabling it to strike out against all foes, tenaciously guarding your fallen body. Treat this effect as a dancing weapon, except that the weapon is allowed to make up to three attacks of opportunity each round. The ankh tirelessly defends you for up to 1 hour or until you regain consciousness. The ankh can only be activated once per day.
