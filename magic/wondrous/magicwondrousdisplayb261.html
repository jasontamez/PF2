Description

These delicate sliver bracers are decorated with blue butterflies. While worn, swallowtail bracers grant the wearer a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. If the wearer worships Desna, the bracers grant an additional boon: Once per day, by speaking a command word and the name and/or title of the intended recipient, the wearer may cast dream. Such a wearer is also immune to nightmare, and when the wearer is targeted by that spell, the effects reflect back upon the caster.
