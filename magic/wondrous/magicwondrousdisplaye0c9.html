Description

This longsword glows and has an aura,
making it appear valuable. Its grip is
hollow and can be filled with a dose of
poison (bought separately, and requiring
a full-round action to refill and rearm).
Once the sword is grasped, its mechanical
trap engages: Small needles in the grip
deliver the poison. Detecting the trap requires a successful DC 30
Perception check made by a character with the trapfinding ability,
and disabling it requires a successful DC 28 Disable Device check.
