Description

The pockets of this simple blue robe
always seem to carry just what the
wearer needs whenever she casts a spell.
The robe functions as a spell component
pouch, providing any spell components or
focuses that are necessary for the wearer's
spellcasting. The robe can even produce
spell components or focuses with a specific
cost, though it provides no more than 50 gp worth of such
materials in any single day. The materials supplied by the robe
are suitable only for spellcasting, and disappear if they leave
the wearer's person or when the spell requiring them is cast.
