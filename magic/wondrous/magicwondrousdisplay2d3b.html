Description

The wearer of this helmet can see
underwater. Drawing the small lenses
in compartments on either side into
position before the wearer's eyes
activates the visual properties of
the helm, allowing her to see five
times farther than water and light
conditions would allow for normal human vision. (Weeds,
obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.)
If the command word is spoken, the helm of underwater
action gives the wearer a 30-foot swim speed and creates
a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it
until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to
breathe freely.
