Description

These two transparent red crystal lenses fit directly over the wearer's eyes. On command, the wearer can speak a prayer to Asmodeus as a standard action to be granted darkvision with a range of 60 feet; within that range, the wearer can see in darkness of any kind, including that created by deeper darkness. While the lenses are activated, they take on the appearance of red-hot, glowing embers, making them extremely distinctive and foiling Disguise checks unless the wearer is disguised as someone or something with glowing red eyes.

The eyes of embersight work for a total of 9 minutes each day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but the eyes must be used in 1-minute increments. Both lenses must be worn by the same wearer for the magic item to take effect.
