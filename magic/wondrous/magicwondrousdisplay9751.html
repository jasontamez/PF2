Description

This mundane-looking but serviceable sheath fits any bladed
slashing weapon, from a dagger to a greatsword. When a weapon
is placed into the sheath of bladestealth, both it and the weapon become invisible (as the invisibility spell) until the weapon is
drawn, at which point it and the sheath become visible again.
The invisible sheathed weapon can still be detected by touch, but
the bearer gains a +5 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal
the weapon, and casual inspection does not reveal it at all. Other
effects that detect or reveal invisible things work normally on the
sheathed weapon.
