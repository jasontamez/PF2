Description

If the user opens this vial while chanting prayers to the Master of Masters, the sand inside this crystal vial pours out to form an elaborate, multicolored mandala in the symbol of Irori's rebus. The vial never runs empty, but pours out only enough sand to craft a single mandala at a time.

This item has two functions. Once per day, the owner can meditate while focusing on the mandala and ponder the great mysteries of the universe. After 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation, the owner recovers a number of ki points equal to half his total ki pool. The ki points recovered in this way are temporary, and go away if the user rests or meditates for 8 hours to recover. Additionally, the owner of this item cannot use it to replenish ki points in excess of his total ki pool.

Once per week, when a command word is spoken, the owner of this item can open the vial and pour out the contents, which coalesce to form a pavbagha (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 295) marked with the Master's Rebus. The pavbagha fights alongside the owner of the vial, protecting her to the best of its ability.
