Description

This talisman is worn lashed around
the neck and is made of flexible bark
woven into a mesmerizing pattern.
While wearing a talisman of beast
training, a wearer finds that animals
become much more patient with her
and amenable to training. As such,
failed Handle Animal checks made during downtime periods-
including those made to rear animals and teach them new
tricks-may be treated as if they were successful. The talisman
can turn 10 failed checks into successes this way. Once the
tenth failed check has been converted to a success, the
talisman falls apart and becomes useless.
