Description

This brown hemp sack is filled with mold spores, soil, and chemical reagents. It can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon breaking open, a sack of sporecrafter's kindness releases russet mold spores in a 5-footradius burst and unleashes 1d4+1 vegepygmies in the nearest adjacent squares. The vegepygmies are not under the control of the user, and immediately attack the nearest creatures for 5 rounds, after which they collapse into nonmagical plant matter.
