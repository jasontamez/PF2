Description

This thick leather collar is studded with onyx gems and fastened with a simple metal clasp. Spell-sharing collars come in a variety of sizes and can be secured around the neck of any creature capable of wearing and using a neck-slot item. They are usually sold in sets.

A creature with the share spells ability (such as an animal companion or familiar) wearing a spell-sharing collar can benefit from that ability with any other creature wearing such a collar that is attuned to its own collar, rather than gaining the benefit only with its bonded master. Attuning two or more spell-sharing collars takes 10 minutes, during which time the collars must be touching one another. A spell-sharing collar can have as many as three other spell-sharing collars attuned to it at once. The granted ability otherwise functions as a familiar's share spells ability.
