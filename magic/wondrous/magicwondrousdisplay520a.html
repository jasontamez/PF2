Description

This mummified human hand hangs around a  character's neck by a leather cord (taking up  space as a magic necklace would). If a magic  ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand,  the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing  it herself, and it does not count against her two ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a  time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows  its wearer to use <a href="spelldisplay0c31.html?ItemName=daylight">daylight</a> and <a href="spelldisplaybdc5.html?ItemName=see%20invisibility">see invisibility</a> each once per day.

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, daylight, see invisibility; Cost 4,000 gp
