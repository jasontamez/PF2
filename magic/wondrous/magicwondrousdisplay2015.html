Description

This item is a roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from
some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed
to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if
it were a real horse of the appropriate kind. A stone horse is
combat-trained.

A stone horse can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never
needs to rest or eat. Damage dealt to it can be repaired either
by feeding it gems (1 hp for every 50 gp value of the gem)
or by casting stone to flesh, then using healing spells until it
reaches its maximum hit points, at which time it automatically
returns to its stone form.

There are two sorts of stone horses.

Courser: This item has the statistics of a horse with hardness 10.

Destrier: This item has the statistics of a heavy horse with
hardness 10.
