Description

A necklace of beast's might is a crude necklace made from a particular part (or close analog) of a creature of a specific type: aberrations, animals, dragons, fey, magical beasts, oozes (often made using hardened leftovers), or vermin. Regardless of the parts used to make the necklace, the necklace quietly rattles when a creature of the specific type is within 100 feet of the wearer. Each necklace also has additional abilities based on its component parts (or analogs), and each requires an additional spell in its construction.
