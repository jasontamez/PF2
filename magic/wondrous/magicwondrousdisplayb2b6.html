Description

This elixir removes all curses and transmutation effects from the imbiber, including the unnatural mutations resulting from the arcane warping of the island of Nal-Kashel or gained through an ancestor's unspeakable interbreeding with ulat-kini. The elixir stops gillmen from transforming into skum but cannot reverse the transformation if a gillman has already become a skum. Only doses of the elixir manufactured on the island of Nal-Kashel can remove the warping effects of the island's influence.
