Description

This long, loose-fitting coat grants a +4
armor bonus to AC and a +2 luck bonus
to the wearer's touch AC against firearm
attacks. If the wearer is a gunslinger or
has the Amateur Gunslinger feat (see
Ultimate Combat), she begins each day
with 1 additional grit point. This extra
point does not increase her maximum grit
total. When the wearer uses the gunslinger's dodge deed, the
deed's dodge bonuses to AC increase by +1. If the wearer is not
a gunslinger, she may use the gunslinger's dodge deed once
per day.
