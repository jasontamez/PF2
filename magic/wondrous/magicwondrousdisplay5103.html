Description

These goggles are made of polished rock crystal, with frames of polished brass and a simple leather strap and buckle sized for a giant's head (but easily adjustable for smaller wearers). The goggles allow the wearer to see through magical and normal fogs, mists, and similar obscurement. They do not confer darkvision or low-light vision. Further, the goggles distort and skew vision strangely, imposing a -4 penalty on Perception checks.
