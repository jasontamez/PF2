Description

This metal cube is small, but when
activated by speaking a command
word it grows to form a tower 20 feet
square and 30 feet high, with arrow
slits on all sides and a crenellated
battlement atop it. The metal walls
extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and
preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a
small door that opens only at the command of the owner of
the fortress-even knock spells can't open the door.


The adamantine walls of an instant fortress have 100
hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired
except by a wish or a miracle, which restores 50 points of
damage taken.


The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door
facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes
instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby
(except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the
fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10
points of damage (Reflex DC 19 halves).


The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word
(different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be
deactivated unless it is empty.
