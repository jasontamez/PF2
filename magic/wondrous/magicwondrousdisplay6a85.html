Description

Favored by the grave-wardens of sites
known to be infested with the spirits
of the dead, this pendant is an iron
ring strung on a necklace made from
polished and discolored bones, nails,
and teeth. A faint blue light limns the
wearer, protecting him from attack.
Undead creatures are repulsed by this light and take a -2
penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer of a gravewatch
pendant. Incorporeal undead creatures are further repulsed
and instead take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls against the
wearer. Undead creatures can sense this light easily, however,
and receive a +4 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to
detect a creature wearing this pendant.
