Description

The inside of these fingerless leather gloves contains minute stitching forming the holy symbol of a specific deity or religion. As a standard action, the wearer can imprint a palm-sized image of the holy symbol onto any object (as if using arcane mark) simply by pressing the palm of one of a pair of dissident's gloves against it. The icon is invisible for 1d4 rounds after the imprinting; it then appears and glows with light equivalent to a candle. While the image is visible, any worshiper of the appropriate faith can use it as a holy symbol by touching it. The image fades after 1 day, but can be prematurely removed by dispel magic or erase.
