Description

These dark-brown, leather gloves are
etched over their entire surface with
arcane insignia. The wearer gains
a +5 competence bonus on Disable
Device checks made to disable
magical traps. Once per day, if the
wearer's check to disarm a glyph,
rune, or similar writing-based magical trap exceeds the DC
by 10 or more, she may change the trigger condition of the
trap instead of disabling it. The new trigger condition must
be one allowed by the magical trap; for example, a glyph of
warding cannot be set according to class, HD, or level, even
when manipulated by the gloves.
