Description

This folding fan made from cypress wood and lacquered paper is said to have belonged to Kikuya, a legendary Minkai oiran, or courtesan. When held in the hand, Kikuya's sensu grants a +2 competence bonus on the bearer's Charisma-based checks. While held, the fan provides the somatic component for spells cast by the bearer. Once per day on command, the bearer can use one face of the fan to cast calm emotions. Also once per day, the fan's other face can create a forceful hand. In addition, the bearer can whisper behind Kikuya's sensu and send the words up to 3 miles away, as the whispering wind spell, once per day.
