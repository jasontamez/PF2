Description

This wooden box contains a popular Osirian board game called senet, a game which has been played since the earliest days of Osirion's First Age. Ten pawns (two sets of five) carved from petrified wood are stored within the box. The top of the box serves as the game board, with three rows of 10 squares each. Two characters can play the game against each other, or a single character can play against the game itself, which animates to play against its opponent.

While a mundane senet game emulates the journey into the afterlife, a game of fortunate passing exerts genuine influence over a player's fate-it's said that a winner the protection and favor of the gods of Ancient Osirion. A game of senet takes 30 minutes to play. At the end of this time, the players make opposed Intelligence checks; whoever wins the check wins the game. If playing against the game itself, the game has an effective Intelligence bonus of +4.

Winning a game of senet with the game of fortunate passing (either against another player or the game itself) charges one of the game's pawns with magic. For the next 24 hours, the winner gains a +2 luck bonus on skill checks and saving throws against fear and death effects. Once used, a pawn loses all magic, becoming a normal playing piece. A game of fortunate passing has 10 pawns; once all 10 pawns have been used, the item becomes a mundane senet game set.
