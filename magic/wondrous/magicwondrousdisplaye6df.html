Description

These tortoise-shell bracers fit so snuggly against their wearer's
skin that they almost seem part of him. The wearer of these
bracers becomes exceptionally calm and composed if she takes
her time to accomplish particular tasks. Whenever she takes 20
on a skill check for a skill that primarily depends on her arms and
hands, she gains a +5 competence bonus on the check.
