Description

This surprisingly soft belt has an
absurdly large buckle, made even
more absurd by the fact that it's
crafted in the shape of a smiling
weasel's face. It grants its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus
to Dexterity, and the ability to move at half normal speed
while prone. Treat the enhancement bonus to Dexterity as a
temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.
The wearer does not take a penalty on melee attack rolls or to
AC against melee attacks while prone. Additionally, the wearer
gains the compression ability (Bestiary 2 295).
