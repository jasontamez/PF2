Description

A permanent globe of shimmering force encloses one corpse, provided the corpse is small enough to fit within the 10-foot diameter of the sphere, which functions as a resilient sphere spell. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation, a disintegrate spell, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects destroy the sphere without causing harm to the corpse within. Nothing can pass through the sphere, either from the outside or from within. The corpse within a force casket is also preserved so that it does not decay.
