Description

These fine dresses are delicately woven with magically preserved and layered leaves. The dresses were originally commissioned for elven diplomats who often interacted with gnomes and other members of Small races, but their use has spread across Avistan. A Medium humanoid who takes 1 interrupted minute to don a gown of graceful petitenes is, at the end of that time, immediately reduced to Small size. This acts as reduce person, except that it does not grant a size bonus to Dexterity or resize items on the wearer's person other than the gown itself. Taking off the gown also requires 1 interrupted minute and returns the gown and its wearer to their original sizes.
