Description

Under tutelage from Embeth Forest sprites, Mother Nightmoss developed this potent salve from the distillation of nightmoss. When smeared on a body or body part from a recently deceased creature, the salve mimics the effects of a reincarnate spell. If this salve is used on a creature during the night of a new moon, roll twice on the reincarnate table and have the recipient player or NPC choose his preferred result.
