Description

Created by Rasputin and the Russian inventor Viktor Miloslav,
this carbon-arc spotlight provides normal light in a 360-
foot line and increases the light level by one step in the
area beyond that, out to a 720-foot line (darkness becomes
dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A spectral
searchlight also reveals ethereal or invisible creatures
or objects in its area of effect. Spectral searchlights are
normally mounted in watchtowers or atop two-wheeled
carts for easier transport.
