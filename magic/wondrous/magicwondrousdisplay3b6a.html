Description

Small loops sewn into this bandolier look like they can hold
twenty alchemical cartridges (ammunition for a firearm,
see Ultimate Combat), but due to a subtle bending of space
can actually hold up to 60 cartridges. Additionally, the six
thin pockets on the bandolier are extradimensional spaces
meant to hold extra guns and gear. The four small pockets
can each hold a one-handed firearm, 1 pound of ammunition,
a powder horn, or a similarly sized object. The two large
pockets are large enough to hold a two-handed firearm or
a similarly sized object. The wearer can draw an item stored
in the bandolier as easily as if from an ordinary ammunition
pouch or holster. The bandolier weighs the same no matter
what is placed inside it.
