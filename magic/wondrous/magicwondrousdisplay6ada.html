Description

This masterwork harrow carrying case protects the harrow deck within from harm. When the case is used as part of a harrowing, the light level within 15 feet of the case darkens to dim light and miniature illusions of the interpreted cards appear in front of the harrower and her subjects. While stored in a traveler's grandiose carrying case, a harrow deck gains a +2 bonus on saves against effects that specifically target the deck.
