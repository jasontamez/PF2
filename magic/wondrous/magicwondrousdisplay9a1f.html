Description

These polished steel vambraces grant a +1 deflection bonus to
AC. Once per day, as an immediate action, if the wearer has at
least one hand free, when he would normally be hit with an
attack from a ranged weapon, he may deflect it with the bracers,
taking no damage from it, as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat.
