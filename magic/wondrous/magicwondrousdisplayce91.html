Description

When worn, a pair of these
slippers enables movement on
vertical surfaces or even upside
down along ceilings, leaving
the wearer's hands free. Her
climb speed is 20 feet. Severely
slippery surfaces-icy, oiled, or greased surfaces-make
these slippers useless. The slippers can be used for 10
minutes per day, split up as the wearer chooses (minimum
1 minute per use).
