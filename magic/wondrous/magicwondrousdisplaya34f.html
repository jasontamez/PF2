Description

This finely constructed mask of colored cloth and carved bone incorporates parts of the animal it represents, such as its hair, hide, horn, fur, and teeth. Depicting the head of an ape, bear, boar, cat, fox, horse, pig, rat, or wolf, the mask completely covers the wearer's face, but the wearer can see through the mask's eyes as though they were her own.

As a swift action, the wearer can transform her head into the form of the animal depicted by the mask for up to 5 minutes per day, absorbing the mask into her body in the process but leaving in place any other item she wears on her head. While so transformed, the wearer retains the ability to speak normally and can complete verbal spell components, utter command words, and activate spell-completion and spell-trigger items. She also gains low-light vision, scent, and either a bite or gore attack (as appropriate to the animal) that deals 1d4 points of damage for a Medium wearer (1d3 if Small).

This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
