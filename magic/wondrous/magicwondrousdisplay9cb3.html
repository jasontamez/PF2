Description

This dust is kept in gaudy bags, but is a simple white powder. When thrown into a fire, it conjures a visible theater of the mind (as minor image) within a 10-foot cube above the flames. The user can manipulate this illusion, which lasts for 2 hours or until the user banishes the scene. The user gains a +2 bonus on all Performance checks to tell a story using the image created by the dust.
