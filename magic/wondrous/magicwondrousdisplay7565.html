Description

These translucent cloth tubes easily fit over their wearer's
arms. The wearer of these sleeves can, when she slips them
on, choose to transform the appearance of her current garments into any other
nonmagical set of clothing. These new clothes fit her perfectly
and are always clean and mended unless she specifically
designates otherwise. When she removes the sleeves, her
clothes revert to their original form.
