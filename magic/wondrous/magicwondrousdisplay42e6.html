Description

This hooded cape is crafted from fine fabric with colorful embroidery and elegant weasel-fur trim. Three times per day, the wearer can spend a standard action to purposely miss an opponent, performing a dramatic feint that causes that opponent to lose its Dexterity bonus to AC until the wearer's next turn. If a swashbuckler wearing the cloak of feinting performs the superior feint deed or uses this cape's ability, the opponent is also dazed until the start of the swashbuckler's next turn if the foe fails a DC 13 Will save.
