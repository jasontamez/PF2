Description

This sight can be attached to a single direct-fire siege engine. When this is done, the sight becomes part of the siege engine, but can be removed from that siege engine with a full-round action. A character firing a siege engine that has this sight attached can look through the scope to see through magical and normal fog, mist, smoke, and similar obscurement, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions. In addition, a character using this scope can choose to take a full-round action to either locate an invisible creature within line of sight or make a single shot that ignores the invisibility of a creature that she knows is in the area.
