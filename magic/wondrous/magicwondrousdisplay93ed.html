Description

The eye of the void normally appears to be a small black
glass or crystal ball 3 to 4 inches in diameter. However,
when commanded to open, the eye reveals itself as the
terrifying, multi-pupilled eye of some abomination from
the dark spaces between the stars. Once per day, the bearer
may hold the eye and speak one of two command words
to open the eye. The first word creates a gaze effect in a
30-foot cone. The second word creates a gaze effect in a 15-
foot sphere. Each creature subject to the gaze must make a
DC 16 Will save; success means the creature is shaken for 1
minute, failure means it becomes frightened for 1 minute
and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. This is a mindaffecting
fear effect.
