Description

This powder appears to be a very
fine, very light metallic dust. A single
handful of this substance flung into
the air coats objects within a 10-foot
radius, making them visible even if
they are invisible. It likewise negates
the effects of blur and displacement.
In this, it works just like the faerie fire
spell. The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and
projected images for what they are. A creature coated with
the dust takes a -30 penalty on its Stealth checks. The dust's
effect lasts for 5 minutes.


Dust of appearance is typically stored in small silk packets or
hollow bone tubes.
