Description

This long tapering pennant resembles
a stylized serpentine figure wearing
a shimmering crown. The figure's
claws function as clasps, attaching it
to a lance, polearm, frame, or staff.
The pennant has no effect when not
mounted properly, or when activated
by a lawfully aligned creature.


Planting the pennant in the ground
generates an area of twisted space
around the flag out to a range of 30 feet. Any creature that
teleports into or out of this area is nauseated for 1 round (a
DC 18 Fortitude save reduces this penalty to sickened). Any creature may end the effect by uprooting the pennant as a
standard action. The pennant functions for 10 rounds per day.
These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
