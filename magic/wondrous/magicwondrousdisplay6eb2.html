Description

The helm of electric radiance is similar to a helm of brilliance,
except its spells focus on electricity rather than fire. Other
aspects of the helm, such as detecting and damaging
undead, remain unchanged. The helm has 10 sapphires that
can be used for chain lightning, 20 pieces of amber that
can be used for lightning bolt, 30 pieces of petrified wood
that can be used for shocking sphere (as flaming sphere
but dealing electricity damage), and 40 opals that can be
used for daylight. In addition, the wearer gains resistance to
electricity 30 and his weapons become shocking weapons
instead of flaming weapons.
