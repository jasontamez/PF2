Description

These gloves grant the wearer
greater control over his summoned
creatures. As long as he wears the
gloves, creatures conjured by the
wearer can understand him as if they
shared a common language. This
communication is not two-way and
does not grant the wearer the ability to understand the creature.


Three times per day, the wearer can attempt to take control
of a summoned creature within 50 feet as if using control
summoned creature (Will DC 16).
