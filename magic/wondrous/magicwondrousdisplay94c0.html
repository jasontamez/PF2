Description

This telescope is adjustable as a full-round action, allowing magnifications anywhere from x2 to x250. The user gains a +5 competence bonus on Knowledge (geography) and Perception checks when using the device to study planets, stars, and other celestial bodies.

As a full-round action, the user can press the two lenses together, compressing the device to a small assayer's lens small enough to occupy the eyes slot. In this form, the lens grants a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks, Perception checks, and Survival checks to follow tracks. Once per week, after studying the possessions or tracks of a creature, the wearer may designate that creature as his quarry. This functions as the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger's quarry ability</a>. If the wearer already has the quarry ability, the lens instead allows him to designate a creature as his quarry even if it is not one of his favored enemies.
