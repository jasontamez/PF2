Description

These sleek gloves bear a faint scaled pattern and shimmer slightly, as if they were covered in ice crystals. While in cold or colder weather (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444), rimeshaper gloves allow the wearer to solidify nearby snow or ice into a light or one-handed weapon of normal quality with a hardness of 2. Creating such a weapon takes the same amount of time that it would take to draw it from a sheath-a move action for most, but faster for a wearer with the Quick Draw feat or a similar ability, for example. These weapons evaporate if left unattended for 1 round; otherwise, they last for 1 minute, after which they melt into pure liquid. Alternatively, as a move action, the wearer can cause actual ice crystals to form over the gloves, causing them to act as masterwork spiked gauntlets that also grant a +2 competence bonus on Climb checks. This effect lasts until it is dismissed as a standard action. Finally, the gloves grant the wearer cold resistance 5.
