Description

This long cloth is wrapped around the chest multiple times
like a bandage. Once per round, the wearer may add an
enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on one attack and damage
roll for an unarmed strike or natural attack (for one specific
attack, not all attacks made with an unarmed strike that
round). The wearer may use this item an additional time per
round when his BAB reaches +6, +11, and +16.

Choosing to enhance an unarmed strike is not an action
and may occur when it is not the wearer's turn (such as when
making an attack of opportunity). The wearer must decide
to use the item before the attack roll is made, but does not
have to expend all uses at the same time. For example, if the
wearer can use the item twice per round, he can use it once
on his turn when making an attack and save the second for
the possibility of making an attack of opportunity.

Additionally, the bodywrap can grant melee weapon
special abilities to a creature's unarmed attacks, so long
as those special abilities to be added apply to unarmed
attacks. See Table 3-8: Melee Weapon Special Abilities
(page 137) for a list of abilities. Special abilities count as
additional bonuses for determining the market value of
the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses.
Any special abilities are set at the time of creation. A bodywrap of mighty strikes cannot have a modified
bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus
equivalents) higher than +7. Unlike an amulet of mighty
fists, a bodywrap needs to have a +1 enhancement bonus
to grant a melee weapon special ability.
