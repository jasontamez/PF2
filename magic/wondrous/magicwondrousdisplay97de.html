Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

These large goggles feature adjustable lenses. When calibrated correctly, they sense the thoughts of a particular creature and send them into the wearer's mind. If the wearer spends 3 rounds studying a creature, spending a standard action each round to calibrate the lenses, she may scan a target's surface thoughts as if she had spent 3 rounds studying the target with detect thoughts. The target can attempt a DC 13 Will save to negate the effect. The wearer must spend three consecutive standard actions each time she wishes to read the mind of a new creature.

If the wearer is an android, he can spend a nanite surge to immediately detect surface thoughts instead of concentrating for 3 rounds.
