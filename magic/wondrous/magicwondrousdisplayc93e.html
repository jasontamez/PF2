Description

This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an
ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a gem
of seeing enables the user to see as though she were affected by
the true seeing spell. A gem of seeing can be used for as many as
30 minutes a day, in increments of 5 minutes. These increments
do not need to be consecutive.
