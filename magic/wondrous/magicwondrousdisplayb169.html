Description

The medal of the hero's heart is an honorary pendant frequently bestowed upon noble crusaders and warriors of goodly churches. The church of Iomedae frequently award these medals to heroes on the front lines of the Worldwound. Though it may take a variety of appearances depending on its crafter and the champion it is awarded to, a medal of the hero's heart nearly always features some depiction of a human heart. The wearer of a medal of the hero's heart gains a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws to remove temporary negative levels.

Alternatively, the wearer of the medal of the hero's heart can expend the medal's magic as an immediate action to avoid gaining 1 permanent negative level. Doing so causes the medal to shatter, destroying it.
