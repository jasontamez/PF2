Description

These leather gauntlets grant the wearer a +2 morale bonus
on unarmed strikes, natural attacks, and combat maneuver
checks versus creatures with the change shape special ability
or similar abilities that allow it to change shape at will. While
the wearer has such a creature grappled or pinned, it cannot
use any shape-changing spells or abilities unless it succeeds
at a concentration check; the DC of this check is 4 + the DC
of casting the spell while grappled. If the wearer has such
a creature pinned, a successful grapple check allows him to
force the target into a specific shape it can take naturally
(without the use of a spell). this involuntary transformation
only forces the creature into a shape it is normally capable of
and does not cost the creature an action.
