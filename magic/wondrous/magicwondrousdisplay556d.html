Description

This slimming garment is fastened
with laces, buckles, and buttons and
reinforced with ribs of leather or bone.
A corset of dire witchcraft grants a +4
armor bonus to AC. If the wearer is a
witch, each day when she communes
with her familiar to prepare spells,
she may enhance one hex she knows,
increasing its caster level by +2 for 24 hours. This enhancement
ends if the corset is removed or if she uses it to enhance a
different hex.
