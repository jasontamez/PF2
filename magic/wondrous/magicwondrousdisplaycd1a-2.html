Description

Mystic symbols embroidered in gold
thread decorate this conical hat. Three
times per day as a free action when
casting a spell, the wearer can shift
metamagic feats on prepared spells. The
wearer can either move a metamagic
feat from another prepared spell to a spell being cast or from
the spell being cast to another prepared spell. In either case, the
spell that gains the metamagic feat can't exceed the spell slot of
the spell that originally had the metamagic feat. For example, a
wizard with detect thoughts, silent dispel magic, and dimension
door prepared could cast a silent detect thoughts (and would
now have dispel magic prepared), but could not cast silent
dimension door. Moving metamagic feats does not increase
spell casting time, even for quickened spells. The hat provides
no benefit to spontaneous casting or spell-like abilities.
