Description

Designed to meet the dual needs of the Chelish elite-glamour and subtlety-the cloak of flash and shadow is a magic reversible cloak. When worn one way, the cloak shimmers with heavy gold and silver embroidery against richly colored silk, and grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma.

When worn inside-out, the matte-black lining seems to absorb light, cloaking you in shadow and giving you a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In this configuration you can cast blur three times per day.

Reversing the cloak's position is a standard action and requires at least one free hand.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, blur, eagle's splendor; Cost 5,500 gp
