Description

This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When
activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered
on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on
a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65
F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is
subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from
one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be reactivated for
1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage
in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.
