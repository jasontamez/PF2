Description

Once the command word is
spoken, this steel disc burrows 3
inches into the ground. To find it,
a character with the trapfinding
ability must succeed at a DC 25 Perception check. Planting the
mine is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Once the mine is set, any creature that steps into its square must
succeed at a DC 14 Will save or the mine levitates the creature 5
inches above the ground. A levitated creature can attack but not
move, is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -4 penalty
to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers.
Flying creatures are immune. The creature can attempt a new
save each round to end the effect. The effect ends after 5 rounds,
with a successful DC 25 Disable Device check, or with a successful
saving throw. The land mine is destroyed when the effect ends.
