Description

This thin steel plate is approximately 1 foot square. When
the command word is spoken, it rapidly stretches outward
and unfolds, becoming a panel 1 inch thick, 3 feet wide,
and up to 30 feet long (stopping its extension when it
encounters any resistance, such as a wall, ceiling, or a
creature.) Each 5-foot segment of the metal bridge has
hardness 10 and 30 hit points. The bridge weighs 300
pounds and can support up to 4,000 pounds. When the
command word is repeated, it collapses into its portable
form once more.


The instant bridge can be activated up to three times per day.
If any part of it destroyed while it is extended, it immediately
loses all magic.
