Description

This circular amulet is formed from three elegantly curved golden rods and has a deep yellow topaz in its center. When worn, the amulet provides a +2 resistance bonus on Fortitude saves against poisons and ongoing effects from poisons. If at any point any of the wearer's ability scores would be reduced to 1 due to ability score damage from poison, the amulet immediately shatters and the wearer benefits from a casting of restoration. This effect does not cure any poisons still affecting the wearer, but it destroys the amulet.
