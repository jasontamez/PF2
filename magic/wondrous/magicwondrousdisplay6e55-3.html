Description

These azure-and-white marbled bracelets feel smooth and perpetually cool to the touch. When worn, they activate once per day as an immediate action to safeguard against sudden airborne attacks and effects by automatically surrounding their wearer in a cylinder of pure wind and elemental air. This effect functions simultaneously as both air bubble and wind wall, protecting against missile weapons, gases, and most gaseous breath weapons. It also activates underwater if the wearer begins to drown. Once activated, the effect lasts for 10 rounds.
