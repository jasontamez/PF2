Description

Each of these special tapers is dedicated
to one of the nine alignments. Simply
burning the candle generates a
favorable aura for the individual if the
candle's alignment matches that of
the character. Characters of the same
alignment as the burning candle add
a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill
checks while within 30 feet of the flame.


A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if
two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if
he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation
time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him as
if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle
continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle
burns for 4 hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply
by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect
it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its
magical properties.


In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast
a gate spell, the respondent being of the same alignment
as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in
the process.
