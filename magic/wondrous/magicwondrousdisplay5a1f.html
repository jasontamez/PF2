This red and violet silk garment,
delicately embroidered with a barely
perceptible web-like pattern, gives
the wearer the ability to climb as if
a spider climb spell had been placed
upon her. In addition, the cloak grants
her immunity to entrapment by web
spells or webs of any sort; she can
move in webs at half her normal
speed. Once per day, the wearer of this
cloak can cast web. She also gains a +2
luck bonus on all Fortitude saves against poison from spiders.
