Description

The wearer of this helm, crafted
from a beast's skull, gains the
ability to communicate with dogs,
wolves, dire wolves, foxes, jackals,
coyotes, and similar canine animals
as the speak with animals spell.
The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy
checks and Charisma checks to influence wolf-like magical
beasts such as blink dogs, winter wolves, and worgs.


On command three times per day, the wearer can unleash
a terrifying howl. When he does so, he makes a single
Intimidate check to demoralize all opponents within 30 feet
that can hear the howl. At the start of the wearer's following
turn, 1d3 wolves appear as if summoned by the spell
summon nature's ally III. They act on the wearer's initiative
and follow her instructions (or attacking her opponents, if
she cannot communicate with them) for 5 rounds before
vanishing in a swirl of pine needles and snow.
