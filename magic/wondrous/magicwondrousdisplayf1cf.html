Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This silk robe is covered in exquisitely detailed embroidery depicting foxes frolicking in a pristine meadow. Four times per day, the wearer can add 1d6 to the result of a Dexterity-, Intelligence-, or Charisma-based skill check as a free action. The wearer can do this only once per check, and the wearer can't benefit from both the lupine robe and the inspiration class feature on the same check.

If the wearer is a kitsune, he can spend two of the robe's daily uses to add 1d10 on a skill check instead of 1d6.
