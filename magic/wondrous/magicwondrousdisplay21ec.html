Description

This bloodshot eye is larger than a grown man's fist. Its vivid green iris suggests strange depths, and is unnerving to look at for too long. Once per day you may use it to cast clairaudiance/clairvoyance. If you can cast scrying, you may use the eye as your focus object for the spell.
