Description

This solid red brick changes its shape to match its bearer's
holy symbol. If the bearer has the channel energy class
feature, she can focus her power on the brick, allowing
her to repair damaged constructs and objects as if they
were living creatures. The item works whether the bearer
channels positive or negative energy. If the bearer has the
Artifice domain, she adds +2d6 points of damage to her
artificer's touch domain power when repairing constructs
and objects.
