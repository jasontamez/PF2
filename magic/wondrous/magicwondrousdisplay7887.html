Description

A lesser version of
the elixir of fire breath,
a gourd of fire burping can
be imbibed as a normal elixir
or, in the case of a user with a large enough
mouth and low enough standards, be completely
consumed in one crunchy gulp. Once the user has
consumed the gourd, she can immediately expel a belch
of fire in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage
to all creatures in the area. A successful DC 12 Reflex save
halves the damage. If the user elects not to use the fire
breath at once, she can store the breath for up to an hour
before it dissipates.
