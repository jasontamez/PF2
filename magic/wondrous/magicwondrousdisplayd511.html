Description

Despite having the strength and texture of unhewn stone, this pale white harp is sculpted from solid glass. A harp of slumber has several effects when played. At will, the user can produce a lullaby effect by plucking a single string. Up to three times per day, the user can strum the harp to produce a sleep effect. If the performer succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (string instrument) skill check, this use of the harp functions as deep slumber instead. The DC for these effects increases by 2 against creatures with the giant subtype.

Mythic: A mythic performer can expend one use of mythic power when strumming a harp of slumber in order to augment the effect it creates to mythic sleep, or mythic deep slumber if the performer also succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (string instrument) check.
