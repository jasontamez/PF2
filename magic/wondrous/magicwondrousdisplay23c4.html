Description

This bracelet of tiny carved skulls allows its wearer to command up to 8 HD worth of mindless undead creatures as the command undead spell. It is a standard action to establish control over an undead creature, and a free action to relinquish control. If the wearer attempts to control more than 8 HD of undead, the new creatures fall under the wearer's control, and any previously controlled undead in excess of this amount become uncontrolled.
