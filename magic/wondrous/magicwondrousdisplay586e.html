Description

This multicolored headband with beaded tassels tips luck in
the wearer's favor. The wearer gains a +1 luck bonus on saving
throws.


Any effect that gives the wearer a luck bonus (such as
a divine favor or prayer spell) or explicitly increases the
wearer's good luck (such as a witch's fortune hex, the Luck
domain's bit of luck domain power, and so on) lasts for 1
round longer than normal on the wearer. Abilities without a
time-based duration (such as carrying a stone of good luck)
are unaffected by the headband.
