Description

Tiny white crystals hang suspended in
a clear fluid inside this fist-sized glass
ball, which contains a miniature scene
of leafless trees in a snow-covered
landscape. Shaking the globe (a move
action) activates it, and causes the
crystals inside to fly wildly about the
globe, taking on the appearance of a mad snowstorm for 1d6
minutes until they settle back down. Shattering an activated
globe (hardness 1, hp 2) creates raging blizzard conditions
in a 2-mile-radius circle centered on the location where the
globe was shattered. In this area, temperatures drop to below
freezing, winds blow at over 50 miles per hour, and heavy
snow falls (see pages 438-439 of the Core Rulebook). It takes
10 minutes for the blizzard to form, and the conditions last
for 1 hour before dissipating, at which point normal weather
conditions in the area return. Once shattered, a globe of
blizzards is destroyed.
