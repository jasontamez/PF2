Description

This tiny hourglass is filled with blood-red sand. The
sand flows only one way and turning it to start the flow
activates its magic. It grants a target creature within 30
feet the following benefits for a limited time-freedom of
movement (as the spell), and suspends any and all of the
following conditions: blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled,
deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded,
insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned.
These effects are suspended rather than dispelled; they
resume when the hourglass is deactivated or expended and
this suspended time does not count toward the duration of
the suppressed effect.


Ending the hourglass's effects is a swift action. The
hourglass can be used for up to 5 rounds in total before its
magic is consumed. These rounds need not be consecutive.
