Description

A pair of angry, squinting eyes is carved into the bowl of this wooden smoking pipe. The pipe defies any attempts to light it; even when it's unlit, pale wafts of smoke constantly crawl out from the pipe's bowl, despite being unlit. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can inhale the smoke and blow it out in a 30-foot cone. While most of the smoke quickly dissipates, a thin layer of it clings to any corporeal invisible creatures caught in the cone. The creatures are revealed as blurred shapes, rather than being invisible, but attacks against them still suffer a 20% miss chance. This effect lasts for 6 rounds.
