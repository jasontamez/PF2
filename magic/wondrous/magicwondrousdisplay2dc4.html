Description

This enchanted apple appears to be made of solid gold. When
dropped or thrown, it draws the attention of the nearest hostile
creature within 20 feet. The creature must make a DC 13 Will save
or be paralyzed as if by hold person as it focuses its undivided
attention on the golden apple. If the creature makes its save on a
later round, it realizes it has been affected by magic and the apple is
not actually gold. While focusing on the apple, the target takes a -2
penalty on Perception checks. The apple is consumed upon being
dropped or thrown.
