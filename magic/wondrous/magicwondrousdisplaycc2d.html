Description

When applied to any matter that was
once alive, such as wood, paper, or a
dead body, this ointment allows that
substance to resist the passage of
time. Each year of actual time affects
the substance as if only a day had
passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all
saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can
be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance).
One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium
or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium
objects, and a Huge object counts as four Medium objects.
