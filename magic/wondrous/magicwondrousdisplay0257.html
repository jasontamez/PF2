Description

This magical cloth vest is made from rich green cloth that is typically a blend of silk and cotton. It has a high collar that is stitched with gold thread forming elaborate, overlapping geometric patterns. This vest reduces the potency of poisons that affect the wearer. As a swift action when the wearer is exposed to a poison, she can tap the vest, expending 1 charge, to gain a +2 bonus on her next Fortitude saving throw against the poison. Additionally, if the wearer is affected with a poison that requires two saves to cure, she can tap the vest a second time, expending another charge, to use her next successful saving throw result as the result for the second save as well. The vest contains 5 charges that recharge daily.
