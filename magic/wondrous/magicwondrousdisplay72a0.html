Description

A chime of opening is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot
long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that
cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The
device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts,
and so on. A chime of opening also automatically dispels a
hold portal spell or even an arcane lock cast by a spellcaster
of lower than 15th level.


The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be
loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the
user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth.
The wielder can then make a caster level check against the
lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her
own. The DC of this check is equal to the Disable Device DC
to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one
form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked,
and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a chime
of opening to get it open. A silence spell negates the power
of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10
times before it cracks and becomes useless.
