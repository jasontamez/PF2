Description

These white leather bracers have delicate elven runes
etched upon them, one reading "swift defeat" and the other
"vengeance." Once per day, as an immediate action when
the wearer takes hit point damage from a target, he may cry
out, "Death to those who wrong me!", swearing vengeance
against the attacker. The wearer gains a +1 competence
bonus on weapon attack rolls made against the target of
his sworn vengeance, and deals an additional 2d6 points of
damage on successful weapon attack rolls.


For the duration of the effect, the wearer takes a -2
penalty on attack rolls against any target other than his
sworn enemy. These bonuses and penalties last for 24
hours or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the
wearer, whichever comes first. If the wearer fails to slay the
target of his oath, these bracers cannot be used again until
7 days have passed.
