Description

Wearing it toughens your body and flesh, giving you an enhancement bonus to your natural armor bonus from +1 to +3, depending on the kind of fetish, similar to an amulet of natural armor. in the creation of one of these amulets, a portion of your spirit is bound up in it so that once worn, if removed, you gain a negative level until this fetish or another ekujae fetish is worn again. This negative level can be permanently removed and your connection with the fetish broken with a restoration spell or a remove curse spell immediately followed by a successful Dc 15 fortitude save. if you fail the save, you must receive another remove curse before you can attempt another save.
