Description

This pair of magical boots shimmers in vibrant shades of
blazing red and burning orange when they are held up
to the light. These boots allow the wearer to gain extra
maneuverability while moving through hazardous areas. As
a free action, the wearer can click her heels together to grant
herself a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks made
to move through threatened squares or to move through
an enemy's space without provoking attacks of opportunity
for up to 10 rounds per day. The rounds do not need to be
consecutive. Furthermore, anytime the wearer of the boots
successfully moves though the space of an enemy without
provoking an attack of opportunity, she gains a +1 bonus
on attack rolls against that enemy until the end of her turn.
