Description

This silvery gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be
illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer
ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell). The effect is dismissible.
The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This
duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1
minute increments.
