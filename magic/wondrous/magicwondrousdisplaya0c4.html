Description

The tools of juvenile necromancers and bitter witches, mockingskulls are immortal and sleepless guardians. Each is made from a humanoid skull inlaid with a precious gem "eye." Mockingskulls keep watch over an area with a +8 Perception check bonus, and can be commanded to either warn away intruders or raise an alarm by screaming insults and invectives. If a mockingskull screams invectives, it can attempt an Intimidate check at a +10 bonus each round against one creature within 30 feet.

Treat a mockingskull as a single Hit Die mindless undead for the purposes of spells and effects that control, damage, or hide creatures from undead. A mockingskull has hardness 3 and 10 hit points; these hit points are automatically restored every midnight. Although largely mindless, especially old mockingskulls sometimes develop personality quirks.
