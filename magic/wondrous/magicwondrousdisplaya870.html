Description

A wearer can remove this mask as a move action to change his appearance as if using disguise self. The effect persists for 10 minutes. A vigilante can instead remove a quick-change mask to switch his identity as a move action. If the mask is used in this way, the effect functions just like changing identities normally (except faster), and doesn't have a limited duration. Regardless of which way he is using a quick-change mask, the user can attempt a Bluff check to create a diversion so he can use Stealth as part of the same move action he uses to activate the mask. The mask dissolves when used.
