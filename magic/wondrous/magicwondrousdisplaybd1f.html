Description

This piece of technology is fashioned from the eye of a robot. Once per hour as a standard action, a creature holding an oculus of magnetic fury can target a single robot within 60 feet with a devastating electromagnetic pulse. The robot takes 10d6 points of electricity damage and becomes helpless for 1 minute. If the target succeeds at a DC 18 Will save, it takes half this damage and negates the helpless effect. A robot rendered helpless by the pulse receives a new Will save each round at the end of its turn to shake off the effect.
