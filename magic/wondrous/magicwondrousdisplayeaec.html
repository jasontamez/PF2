Description

This red maggot constantly writhes and distends, snapping a small pair of pincers. A combination of hellwasp and worm, the hivebrain symbiote grants an echo of a hive mind when attached to an intelligent creature. When placed on the back of a host's neck as a standard action, the hivebrain symbiote attaches painlessly and immediately boosts the host's mental faculties. While having a hivebrain symbiote attached, as an immediate action the host can reroll a concentration check or an Intelligence-based check. The host must take the second roll, even if it is worse. An attached hivebrain symbiote continues to function for a number of hours equal to the host's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1 hour) before falling off and dying. A hivebrain symbiote dies immediately if removed before this time elapses.
