Description

The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a
monstrous maw and is large enough to accommodate a single
Medium creature. When the cauldron is filled with pure water
and certain rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature is
placed inside it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if
with a raise dead or resurrection spell. The spell effect depends
on the components used: raise dead costs 5,000 gp worth of
materials, while resurrection costs 10,000 gp worth of materials.
The cauldron is usable once per day.
