Description

This flanged collar of mithral and steel protects the wearer's
neck and shoulders. It provides a +2 armor bonus to AC (this
does not stack with other armor bonuses) and grants the light
fortification property to the wearer. In addition, the wearer may
engrave a glyph of warding directly onto the guardian gorget.
When the wearer is struck in melee, she can trigger the glyph as
an immediate action, causing the glyph to discharge against the
creature making the attack (and other creatures within 5 feet,
if a blast glyph was placed, though the wearer is not harmed
by the glyph's effects). The glyph can be triggered even if the attack would normally leave the wearer incapable of taking
actions (such as killed, stunned, dazed, or knocked unconscious).
