Description

This shining white cloak is trimmed with golden sunbursts
and continuously radiates light (as per the light spell, but
only in a 10-foot radius). Twice per day, the wearer can
command the cape to erupt in a burst of light, blinding all
creatures other than the wearer within 20 feet for 1d4
rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates). After triggering this burst,
the wearer becomes invisible (as the invisibility spell, with
a duration of 1 minute) and the cape's light is extinguished
as long as the wearer is invisible.
