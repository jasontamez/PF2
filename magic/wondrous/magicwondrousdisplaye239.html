Description

This fearsome-looking mask of ivory, beaten copper, or pale
wood is typically fashioned into the likeness of a human skull
with a missing lower jaw, allowing the bottom half of the
wearer's face to remain visible when the mask is worn.


Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the
mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels
up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target
assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack
against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus.
If the attack succeeds, the target must make a successful
DC 20 Fortitude save or take 130 points of damage, as if
affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds
at its saving throw, it nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of
damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the
mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points,
and hardness 6.
