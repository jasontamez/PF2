Description

This conch shell measures only a few inches long and shimmers with a delicate pink color. Shells of sending always come in pairs, with each shell attuned to the other. If pairs are mixed up or lost, a shell of sending can be attuned to a new shell of sending in a process that takes 24 hours.

Once per day, anyone holding a shell of sending can whisper up to 25 words into the shell. The sender's words emerge from the second shell, audible to anyone holding the attuned shell, as long as the receiver is on the same plane of existence. If the receiver wishes, she can send a return message of up to 25 words.

Anyone eavesdropping on either sender or receiver must attempt a DC 14 Will saving throw. On a success, an eavesdropper can hear the speakers normally. On a failure, the speakers seem to be relaying gibberish and nonsense words to each other. Creatures who fail this saving throw by 5 or more are deafened for 1d4 minutes.
