Description

A favored cloak of rangers, this cloak is a patchwork of hides
and fur. Comfort's cloak grants a constant endure elements
effect to the wearer, and grants a +4 competence bonus to
saves against disease, energy drain, effects that cause fatigue
or exhaustion, and poisons. Furthermore, while the wearer is
resting he regains twice his Hit Dice in hit points for 8 hours of
rest instead of the typical 1 hit point per Hit Die. When taking a
full 24 hours of rest, the character regains 5 times his Hit Dice
in hit points instead of twice his Hit Dice in hit points.
