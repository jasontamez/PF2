Description

This set of goggles is engraved with geometric patterns and arcane runes. The wearer can immediately see and discern magical auras within 60 feet, as <a href="spelldisplayc94f.html?ItemName=arcane%20sight">arcane sight</a>. In addition, the wearer is more clearly able to see the animating forces of incorporeal creatures and can therefore harm incorporeal creatures with nonmagical attacks, though these attacks deal only half damage. If the wearer uses a magic weapon to attack an incorporeal creature, the attack deals full damage instead. The goggles have no effect on attacks made with <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> weapons.

Once per day on command, the wearer can amplify the goggles' ability to sense animating forces for 1 hour. This amplification allows the wearer the ability to notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 30 feet, just as if she had a psychopomp's <a href="monsterfamilies01d9.html?ItemName=Psychopomp">spiritsense</a> ability . The goggles do not grant the wearer the ability to discern magical auras while amplified.
