Description

Rather than being made of one continuous line
of material, this belt consists of many bits of
tanned leather joined together by thick metal
studs. On command, the belt's wearer can
transform the belt into a single masterwork
slashing and/or piercing melee weapon of her
choice. As long as she is holding the weapon, she can also revert it back to belt form with a command. Furthermore, the belt
can be enchanted like a piercing and slashing melee weapon,
using the cost of the belt as the cost of the masterwork item.
