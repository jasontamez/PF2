Description

A favored item among the dervishes of Sarenrae, this skirt of overlapping, brightly colored silk is magically reinforced, granting you increased durability and mobility. You gain a +2 natural armor bonus to AC and a +2 competence bonus on Acrobatics and Perform (dance) checks.

Once per day, when an adjacent foe attempts to take a 5-foot step away from you, you may make a 5-foot step as an immediate action so long as you end up adjacent to that foe. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.
