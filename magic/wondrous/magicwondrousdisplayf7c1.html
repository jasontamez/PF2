Description

These tight-fitting mithral bracers are used throughout the Inner Sea region in nations where dueling is prominent. The wearer of dueling cuffs gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +2 if the wearer is wielding one or more weapons that benefit from the Weapon Finesse feat.

In a duel (Ultimate Combat 150), the wielder doesn't take the normal -5 penalty when using the dueling parry action. In addition, the wielder can attempt to deflect ranged attacks from firearms with a dueling parry, but takes a -5 penalty on such attempts.
