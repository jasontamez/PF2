Description

A stone of this nature is typically an
oddly shaped bit of roughly polished
rock. On command as a full-round
action, the bearer may summon an
earth elemental. If there is an unbroken
piece of unworked stone of at least
Huge size nearby, the stone conjures a Huge earth elemental as if using summon monster VI. If there is no such stone available
(for example, if there is only sand, earth, worked stone, or smaller
pieces of stone), the stone conjures a Large earth elemental as
if using summon monster V. The stone cannot summon another
elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the
duration of its summoning expires.
