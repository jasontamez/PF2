Description

These tattooing needles can grant a +5 competence bonus
on Craft (tattoos) checks. Once per day they can be used to
transform an object into a tattoo on a willing creature. This takes
10 minutes. The object may resist with a DC 17 Fortitude saving
throw. The transformed object radiates faint transmutation
magic and looks like a miniature depiction of itself. The bearer
of the tattoo may peel it off as a standard action, transforming it
back into its object form. The tattoo automatically reverts back to
its object form after 7 days, if dispelled (using the caster level of
the needles), or upon the death of the tattooed creature.
