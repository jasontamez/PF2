Description

This stone absorbs your soul as the magic jar spell immediately
prior to your death. You can’t transfer your soul from the ioun stone
receptacle to another creature’s body, and are, for all intents and
purposes, dead. While your soul is in the ioun stone, you can sense
any life forces within 120 feet as though you were placed in a
magic jar. At any point within 12 hours of your soul’s transfer into
the pale orange rhombus ioun stone, you can return to your body
as long as it is within 120 feet of the ioun stone. Upon returning
to your body, you are unconscious and dying with a number of
negative hit points equal to your Constitution score minus 1. If you
fail to stabilize and aren’t healed after 1 turn, you die and your soul
is not absorbed by the ioun stone. Your soul can be absorbed into
a pale orange rhombus ioun stone only once per 24-hour period.

Resonance

A soul held within the stone
can remain there indefinitely as long as the wayfinder
remains on the soul’s original body. If the wayfinder is
removed from the body, the ioun stone’s resonant power is
suppressed until the wayfinder is replaced.
