Description

This marvelous mithral necklace forms a broad, draping
lacework of threadlike chains set with a multitude of tiny
jewels. Seven of these jewels are larger than the rest.
While wearing a necklace of netted stars, the wearer can
create dancing lights at will and wandering star motes (see
Advanced Player's Guide) once per day. In addition, each of
the seven jewels of the necklace can recall a previously cast
1st-level or 0-level spell, as a pearl of power.


Once per day, the wearer may use the necklace to catch a
spell targeted at him, as if readying an action to counterspell
using dispel magic, with a bonus on the check equal to 12 +
the number of jewels not yet used to recall spells that day.
If all jewels have been used, this ability cannot be used that
day. The level of the spell to be countered must be less than
or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell
succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its
magical energy to recall a previously cast spell of the same
level or lower as an immediate action. Whether or not the
attempt succeeds, this action exhausts the power of all of the
necklace's jewels for that day.
