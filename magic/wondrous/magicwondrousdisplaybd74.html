Description

These linen bandages have the same
color and softness as the feathers of a
dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests
a less natural origin. Any creature
wrapped in these bandages recovers
from wounds and ability damage each
day as if receiving complete bed rest, regardless of activity
(Core Rulebook 191). A creature actually receiving long-term
care (from the Heal skill) or complete bed rest while wearing
the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit
Dice when determining how many hit points it recovers each
day. The bandages are destroyed once removed or when the
wearer recovers all hit points and ability damage, whichever
comes first.
