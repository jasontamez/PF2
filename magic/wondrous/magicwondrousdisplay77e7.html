Description

This slender flute inscribed with diabolical symbols grants additional control over charmed creatures. When played by a person who succeeds at a DC 13 Perform (wind instruments) check, the flute allows the player to issue a telepathic command to a single creature within 30 feet he has previously charmed, per the suggestion spell. If the player issues a suggestion that would put the charmed creature in harm's way, the creature receives a DC 13 Will save to resist. A successful save prevents the victim from following the order that round, but the creature remains charmed in any case.
