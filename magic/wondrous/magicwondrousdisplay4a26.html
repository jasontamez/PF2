Description

These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres
about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands).
They come in pairs and are unremarkable in
appearance. If both of the pair are sounded,
all creatures within 120 feet (with the
exception of those within a 20-foot-radius
safe zone around the drums) are affected as
by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Drums of panic can be used
once per day.
