Description

This lustrous golden bell produces a deep and resonant ring
which vibrates in perfect harmony with the Material Plane
and destructively interferes with otherworldly beings. These
vibrations reduce the damage reduction and spell resistance
of all extraplanar creatures within 30 feet by 5 (for example,
changing DR 10/magic to DR 5/magic). The bell has no clapper;
to ring it, the bearer must attack it with an unarmed strike (this
counts as an attack, with no attack roll needed, and does not
damage the bell). The ringing lasts 1d6 rounds; stifling the
ringing early is a standard action. It can ring for a maximum of
10 rounds per day.
