Description

This cloak is lined with thin strings of varying colors that shift in color to match surrounding material such as dirt, grass, or stone. This grants the wearer a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks. As a standard action, the wearer is able to physically meld into material such as wood, plaster, or stone (but not metal or other heavily worked materials), appearing as a dim shadow on the surface. The wearer can move across any exposed portion of the material at half her normal movement speed, allowing her to travel up walls or across floors. While melded with material in this manner, the wearer gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer can meld with material for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

Nearby creatures can notice the melded wearer with a successful Perception check. The wearer can be targeted normally while melded with material. If the wearer takes any damage while melded, or if the surface material is manipulated with stone shape, warp wood, or similar spells, the wearer is immediately shunted out of the material into the nearest open space.
