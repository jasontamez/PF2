Description

This faintly glowing bowstring is twined from the hair of a lillend. When strung on a bow, a tuned bowstring also functions as a masterwork stringed instrument, granting the wielder an enhancement bonus on Performance (string) checks equal to the bow's enhancement bonus (if any). A tuned bowstring produces a perfect note with every arrow fired by its wielder, allowing a character with the bardic performance class feature to maintain a performance in combat without expending rounds of bardic performance as long as she fires at least one arrow each round. Activating a bardic performance or switching to a different performance still costs a round of bardic performance.
