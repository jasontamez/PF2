Description

This elegant cape, trimmed in gold in a pattern resembling
an ancient maze, forestalls the negative effects of aging.
The wearer no longer suffers penalties to Strength,
Dexterity, and Constitution from being of middle age or
older (Core Rulebook 169). The penalties return if the robe is
removed (or its powers suppressed), and the sudden weight
of years is so traumatic that the wearer must make a DC 20
Fortitude save or be exhausted for 24 hours. Donning the
robe again removes the age penalties, but does not remove
this exhaustion, which must pass on its own or be remedied
with magic.
