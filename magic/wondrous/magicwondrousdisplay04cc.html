Description

This military saddle is made of cured hide, with numerous straps and hooks to allow it to be easily configured to fit different sizes of animals and saddlebags. Any creature of the animal or magical beast type of an appropriate shape to wear a saddle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with GM discretion) can wear the war saddle, which magically changes size and shape as necessary. The saddle allows the creature wearing it to act as if it were combat trained (see the Handle Animal description on page 97 of the Core Rulebook for more information on combat training), and gives the rider a +5 competence bonus on Ride checks made while mounted upon the creature.
