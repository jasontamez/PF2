Description

Used by warriors of ancient Azlant, these strangely shaped ioun stones are popular with combat-savvy members of the Pathfinder Society. These variant ioun stones resemble a thorny sphere-each possesses a circular shape with dozens of needle-like points jutting out. Each type of stone is a different color and grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on checks for a specific combat maneuver. All varieties of thorny ioun stone have the same price and cost.

This ioun stone grants a +2 competence bonus on overrun attempts.

Resonance
