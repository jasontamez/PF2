Description

A Lastwall banner can be displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. The banners depict the heraldic symbols of several key sites and fortresses once held by Lastwall, and each provides different benefits, which are described below.

A banner can be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of the owner.

Harchist (abjuration aura): Allies of the owner of the Lastwall Harchist banner gain a +6 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects so long as they can see the banner. If the mass combat rules (Ultimate Campaign 234) are being used, so long as this banner is visible to the majority of an army, the DC of the Morale check to determine whether the enemy routs decreases by 5.

Hordeline (abjuration aura): Allies of the owner of this banner gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects so long as they can see the banner.

Sunwall (transmutation aura): Once per day, while this banner is held aloft or planted by someone with the bravery class feature or the Flagbearer feat (The Inner Sea World Guide 286), all allies of the Lastwall Sunwall banner's owner gain the benefits of a blessing of fervor spell (Advanced Player's Guide 205) while the banner is visible. If the banner is defaced or toppled by an enemy force, this effect ends, and the enemy force gains the benefits of this banner for 10 rounds.
