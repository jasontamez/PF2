Description

This imperfect, rose-tinted gemstone resembles a teardrop or
a broken heart depending on its orientation. Its pale facets are
typically marred by a single crack or chip near the gem's middle.


Once per day, the bearer may spend a standard action
to transfer 3d6 hit points from himself into the gem. This
deepens the gem's color, with a stronger color indicating
more life energy stored in it. The gem can store a maximum
of 18 hit points. If any hit points are stored in the gem, the
bearer may touch it himself or another creature as a standard
action, transferring all the stored life energy from the gem to
the target creature, healing it a number of hit points equal
to the amount stored in the gem. This returns the gem to its
normal color.
