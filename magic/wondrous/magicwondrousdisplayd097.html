Description

This squarish jar holds dead insects suspended in bright pink liquid. When the imbiber drinks this concoction, his body dissolves into a swarm of stinging wasps, causing his equipment to fall to the ground. During this transformation, the imbiber retains all his mental statistics but gains the physical statistics of a wasp swarm. The imbiber can take only actions to control the movement of the swarm form or purely mental actions. If at any point during the duration the swarm reaches 0 hit points, the effect immediately ends and the imbiber transforms back to his original form. This effect otherwise lasts 1 hour.
