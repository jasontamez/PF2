Description

This silver chalice has stylized representations of rearing unicorns
serving as handles. The bearer of the chalice can expel toxins
from a poisoned creature's body, causing the target to weep
the poison from its eyes and allowing the bearer to collect it
in the chalice. This functions as neutralize poison on the target,
eliminating that poison. If the target is immune to poison or the
poison has run its course, the chalice has no effect. If the poison
normally has a solid or liquid form, it collects as a single dose of
the poison in the cup (regardless of how many times the target
was poisoned). The collected poison has all the normal effects of
the original poison, except its DC is 4 lower, and can be stored in
another container or used like any other poison. The chalice can
be used once per day.
