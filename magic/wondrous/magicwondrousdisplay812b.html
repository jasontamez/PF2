Description

These silver bracers are polished to a mirrored sheen, but
otherwise shift their appearance to match whatever suit of
armor they are worn with.


If the wearer has levels in a class that grants a smite ability
(such as a paladin, or a cleric with the destruction domain),
her smite damage is treated as though she were a member
of that class four levels higher. If the wearer is not a member
of such a class, once per day she may make one smite attack,
gaining a bonus on the attack roll equal to her Charisma
bonus, and a +5 bonus to the damage roll on a hit.
