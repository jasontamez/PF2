Description

These studded leather gloves look similar to workman's
gloves, though they are reinforced with numerous metal
strips that the user can extend or retract as she wills, turning
the tip of each finger into a customizable tool useful in
examining and disarming traps. While worn, these gloves
grant a +5 competence bonus on all Disable Device checks
made to disarm traps. In addition, the gloves grant the user a
+1 luck bonus on all saving throws made against traps.
