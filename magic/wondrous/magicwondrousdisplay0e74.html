Description

These battered iron manacles are typically found with a small
spiked iron key in one of the locks. The shackles magically
adjust themselves to fit around the wrists of any creature
from Small to Large size and automatically lock. A creature
wearing shackles of compliance becomes more susceptible
to intimidation. Any creature attempting to intimidate or
demoralize a target wearing shackles of compliance gains a
+4 bonus on Intimidate checks. In addition, the holder of the
manacles' key can cast command (DC 25 Will) on the wearer of
the shackles three times per day.


Shackles of compliance have hardness 10 and 10 hit points,
and a DC 30 Disable Device check is required to pick the
shackles' lock. A manacled creature can break free with a DC
28 Strength check or DC 35 Escape Artist check. The manacles
lock can be opened with a DC 30 Disable Device check.
