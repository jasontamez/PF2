Description

The wearer of these boots can, on command three times
per day, cause her current square to sprout a thick canopy of
fruit-bearing or otherwise edible plants. These plants count
as difficult terrain and grant cover to any Medium or smaller
creature within the square. They also provide enough food
to sustain two Medium creatures for 1 full day. While the
plants can grow on surfaces that would not normally support
vegetation such as a wooden floor or cave stone, they cannot
sprout on surfaces explicitly hostile to vegetation. The plants
are usually of a sort common to the terrain or climate of the
area in which they were produced. They disappear after 24
hours or when completely harvested, whichever comes first.
