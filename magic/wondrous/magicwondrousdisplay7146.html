Description

This round-bellied bottle contains a deep indigo liquid. Drinking this liquid causes the imbiber's skin and organs to harden as a metallic sheen encases her body. This imparts a +2 competence bonus to her natural armor and 5 temporary hit points. This effect lasts 10 minutes. The first time the imbiber is in melee combat during the duration, he can increase the competence bonus to +4 and gain an additional 5 temporary hit points, but all of her movement speeds are halved for the remainder of the duration.
