Description

This thick burgundy cloak is trimmed with mithral plates
and cut to fit handsomely over heavy armor. As a fullround
action, the wearer can spin in his space, damaging
each creature within 5 feet. This attack uses the wearer's
highest base attack bonus against each creature, and deals
2d6 damage on a hit. The wearer is considered proficient
with this attack. Furthermore, the cloak can be magically
enhanced like a melee weapon, adding the cost of the
melee weapon property to the cloak's cost.
