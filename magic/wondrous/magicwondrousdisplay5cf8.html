Description

This bottle is crafted from the darkest ebony. When opened
and held upright, faint whispers can be heard emanating from
the bottle's mouth. The bottle initially has 4 charges. When
turned upside down, the bottle summons a shadow to do the
bidding of the user, draining 1 charge each round of service.
As a standard action, the bearer may dismiss the summoned
shadow. If the shadow kills a humanoid creature of at least
4 HD, the bottle gains 1 charge. The bottle is automatically
restored to 4 charges at sundown.
