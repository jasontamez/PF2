Description

These chests most often appear as hinged, reinforced wooden barrels with saddles. Upon close inspection, a keyhole is visible on the side of the barrel, where a good lock is inset. The chest's interior can hold up to 6 cubic feet of material. The chest can be ridden by a single Medium creature or two Small creatures, and is able to fly through the air as if affected by an overland flight spell (with a +5 bonus on Fly checks) for up to 10 hours per day, split up as its owner desires. The chest can carry up to 300 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, or up to 600 pounds at a speed of 30 feet. Only the weight of riders and materials strapped to the chest's exterior counts for this limitation, not the weight of material stored within.
