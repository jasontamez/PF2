Description

This horn functions as a horn of blasting, except that it deals 10d6
points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens
them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude save reduces the damage
by half and negates the stunning and deafening). Crystalline
objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the
horn of blasting. A greater horn of blasting also has a 20%
cumulative chance of exploding for each usage beyond the first
each day.
