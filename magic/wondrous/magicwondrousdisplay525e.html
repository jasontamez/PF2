Description

Large eagle feathers decorate the back
and arms of this magnificent cape.
Should the cape's wearer fall more than
5 feet, the cape spreads out behind
the wearer and she gently drifts to the
ground. This acts exactly like a feather
fall spell for the wearer only. Once per
day, if the wearer grasps the edges of
the cape and spreads her arms, she transforms into an eagle
(as per the beast shape I spell, except that it allows only eagle
form and the wearer gains the eagle's full fly speed of 80 feet).
This effect lasts for 10 minutes but can be ended prematurely as
a standard action. In addition, while in eagle form, the wearer
gains a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.
