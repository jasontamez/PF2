Description

The forest-green cloak grants a +5 competence bonus on
Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. In addition, once per day,
before making a Diplomacy or Sense Motive check, the wearer
can decide to call upon the powers of the cloak to roll twice
and take the better result. Finally, the wearer of this cloak
can adjust a creature's attitude up to three steps when using
Diplomacy, instead of the normal limit of two steps. However,
the cloak's power does have one drawback. Should the wearer
ever fail a Diplomacy checks made to adjust a creature's
attitude by 5 or more, the creature's attitude is reduced by two
steps instead of one.
