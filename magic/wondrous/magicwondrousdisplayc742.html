Description

Decorated with the emblems of the Earth Child cadre, an earth child faceguard is designed to refine the wearer's focus when fighting giants. The wearer gains the benefits of Earth Child Style (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 99), regardless of whether she meets the prerequisites. If the wearer does not possess the defensive training racial trait, the dodge bonus to AC against giants is reduced to +2. If the wearer already possesses the Earth Child Style feat, she can enter the earth child stance as a free action.
