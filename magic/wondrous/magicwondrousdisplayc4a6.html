Description

This billowing white cape renders the wearer almost invisible
the moment she is submerged in salt water, granting her
concealment (20% miss chance) so long as she remains
entirely submerged. The wearer can breathe underwater and
gains a swim speed of 20 ft. While the wearer is submerged,
the cape surrounds her with tiny stinging tentacles. Any
creature that ends its turn adjacent to the wearer takes 1 point
of electricity damage and must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude
saving throw or be sickened for 1 round. The sickened effect
is a poison effect.
