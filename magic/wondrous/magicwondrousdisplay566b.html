Description

This shimmering black dust causes one creature to be coated in
a layer of darkness for 1 minute. In normal light, the creature
gains concealment (20% miss chance). In dim light, the creature
gains total concealment (50% miss chance). It has no effect in
areas of bright light or darkness (though in bright light, a viewer
can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the target is slightly
shadowed). Creatures with darkvision see through the dust's
darkness as if it were normal darkness. The dust dispels and
counters the outlining effects of glitterdust, but doesn't affect
the spell's blinding effects. Glitterdust dispels and counters the
effects of the dust of darkness.
