Description

Created from the bodies of certain frogs whose poisons induce potent hallucinations and delusions, these mummified husks are variously cited as the invention of either grippli druids or an unusually cunning boggard priest-king. Regardless, their powers are a boon to any caster favoring mental manipulation and alteration.

Three times per day while casting a targeted mind-affecting spell that allows a Will save, a caster holding a fetish of the frog queen can lace the spell's energies with a magical poisonous essence. Instead of affecting the target's mind directly, the altered spell attacks through the victim's body as a psychotropic toxin, requiring the victim to use his Fortitude modifier in place of Will for the purposes of any Will saving throws the spell normally allows.

An altered spell is considered a poison effect, with the following conditions. <ul><li>An altered spell can be suppressed by effects such as delay poison. Time spent suppressed still counts against the spell's duration.</li><li>If accelerate poison (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 201) is used on the spell, the poison effect's duration is halved but its saving throws are unaffected.</li><li>An altered spell transferred to another target, such as by absorb toxicity (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 221), is still considered cast by the original caster for the purposes of adjudicating spell effects, such as which creature a charmed victim regards as its friend.</li></ul> An altered spell is still vulnerable to spell resistance, dispelling, and other effects as normal.

Three varieties of fetish of the frog queen exist: lesser, standard, and greater. A lesser fetish affects spells of up to 3rd level; a standard fetish affects spells of up to 6th level; and a greater fetish affects any spell.
