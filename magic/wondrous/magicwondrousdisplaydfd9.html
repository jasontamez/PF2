Description

This small flask smokes with an odorless black mist when opened. Each flask contains a single use of ebon flame, a strange sort of fire that is hostile to normal fire. Cool to the touch even in hot environs, when poured out, a flask creates a 20-footradius burst of black fire centered on the user. This burst of ebon flame extinguishes all natural fires and dispels magical fire (dispel check 1d20+5) in the area, including magic items that have fire effects (such as a flametongue sword or a necklace of fireballs), although items dispelled merely cease to function for 1d4 rounds.

The ebon flame can cure damage caused by fire- each creature in the burst is healed 5d6 points of damage caused by fire effects.

A creature with the fire subtype inside the area of the burst takes 5d6 points of damage and is stunned for 1 round-a successful DC 15 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect.

Ebon flame is unstable, and when combined in doses larger than a single use, or when not stored in a specially prepared flask, it dissipates harmlessly in a cloud of faint black smoke. Overlapping areas of ebon flame do not stack their effects.
