Description

This white headband, often painted or embroidered with
calligraphy or a stylized pictogram such as a sunburst, helps
focus the wearer's resolve and absolute determination to
survive and succeed. The wearer gains a +2 morale bonus on
stabilization checks and on saving throws against ongoing
effects with recurring saves, such as diseases, poisons, or
compulsions such as dominate person or hold person.


If the wearer is a samurai, he treats his resolve ability as if
he were two class levels higher.
