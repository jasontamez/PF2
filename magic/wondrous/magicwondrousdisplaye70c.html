Description

Appearing at first like an expensive, masochistic adornment,
this almond-sized star ruby is set in a gold clasp, one side of
which is festooned with several long spikes. A soulbound eye
is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear-
they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to
use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A
soulbound eye must be attached to a willing or helpless
creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature’s
brow-the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the
victim’s forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared
link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item
on its head (the "master").


Once implanted, the soulbound eye allows the master to
observe the world around the wearer through the wearer’s
senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between
the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function
across planar boundaries.


The soulbound eye’s wearer is not compelled to obey its
master’s telepathic commands, but the master can use the
soulbound eye as a conduit for hold monster, modify memory,
pain strike (Advanced Player’s Guide), and suggestion spells,
treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the
distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed
any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells
cast through the soulbound eye.


An implanted soulbound eye functions like a cursed
item once it is in place-it can only be removed if the
curse is first lifted via an effect like remove curse or break
enchantment. Once removed, a soulbound eye crumbles
to fragments.
