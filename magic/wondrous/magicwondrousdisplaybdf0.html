Description

This plain mask is made of a reflective, dark gray ceramic. When worn, the mask transforms to look like the wearer's skull, and it gradually becomes eerier and more fearsome the closer a viewer gets to the wearer. Whenever a creature enters a square adjacent to the wearer of Bax's mask, that creature must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become shaken for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer. An affected creature can attempt a new save by moving away from the wearer and reentering a square adjacent to the wearer. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the mask's effect for 24 hours. A creature shaken by Bax's mask does not become frightened if affected by the mask again, but other fear effects stack with the creature's shaken condition as normal.
