Description

This brown and gray robe is always dirty, and the chest and the
back of each shoulder is decorated with a gem-like eye pattern.
The wearer gains a +5 bonus on Perception checks, and can use
earth glide to pass through up to 20 feet of natural or worked
stone per day. The distance traveled with earth glide does not
need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 5-foot increments.
The wearer is able to safely chew, swallow, digest, and derive
nutrition from gems, precious metals, and metallic ore, with 100
gp worth of these materials sustaining him for 1 full day. If the
wearer removes the robe after such a meal, he is sickened until
24 hours have passed since the last meal of this kind. Wearing
the robe again immediately negates this penalty.
