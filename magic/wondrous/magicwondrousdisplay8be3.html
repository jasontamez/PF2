Description

The cut and color of this solemn vestment varies from religion
to religion, but its properties are the same. The wearer may
command the cassock of the clergy to display the holy symbol
of her deity or hide this symbol. At the most basic level, the
garment functions as a divine focus. Additionally, the wearer
gains a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks to
influence creatures that match her alignment or that of her
patron deity. Also, the wearer may use bless and sanctuary
(DC 11) each once per day, and may prepare one additional
orison each day. If the wearer is a spontaneous divine caster,
once per day she may spend 1 hour in prayer to gain an
orison of her choice as a spell known for the next 24 hours.
