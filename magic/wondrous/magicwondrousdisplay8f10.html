Description

The abjurations woven into this woolen poncho not only defend
against gunfire, but also insulate the wearer from dangerous
magic. The wearer gains a +2 luck bonus to touch AC. Once per
day as an immediate action, the wearer can negate a single
ranged touched attack targeted at him, but cannot use this
ability if the attack is a confirmed critical hit. When the wearer
uses this ability, he must fall prone.
