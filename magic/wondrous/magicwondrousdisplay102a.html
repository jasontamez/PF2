Description

This unassuming pendant whispers a constant discordant chorus of voices into the mind of its wearer. As a standard action, the wearer can focus on these voices and pick out one from a past life. The voice whispers information related to a particular subject, granting the wearer a +2 insight bonus on one type of Knowledge check for 1 minute. The wearer can use this ability once per day for each type of Knowledge in which she is trained, choosing a different type of Knowledge each time. Additionally, once per day, the wearer can spend 1 minute consulting with the voices for aid with a future task, as per augury.
