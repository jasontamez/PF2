Description

These eight rune-engraved dragon bones may be used as a
divine focus for augury. They add 5% to the chance to successfully
cast augury and divination. The bearer of the set gains a +3 luck
bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will),
determined randomly each day. If a creature carries multiple sets
of dragonbone divination sticks, all of them provide a bonus on
the same saving throw.
