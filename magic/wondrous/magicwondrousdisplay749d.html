Description

This ghost-white shawl is partially transparent and flutters elegantly with every motion its wearer makes. If the wearer has the shared consciousness class feature (Occult Adventures 73), she gains the Skill Focus feat in both skills determined by her phantom's emotional focus while the phantom is manifested in ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. While her phantom is confined in her consciousness, she instead gains a +4 competence bonus on skill checks with those skills.
