Description

This potent preparation causes a creature who drinks it to fall
madly in love with the first creature he or she perceives after
consuming it. The drinker's attitude toward that creature
becomes helpful. If a romantic attraction is possible toward
the first person viewed, the drinker falls in love with that
person. Otherwise, the drinker's love is a platonic adoration.
The effects of the philter are permanent unless removed by
a break enchantment, dispel magic, limited wish, miracle,
remove curse, or wish.
