Description

This small opaque flask releases a thick stream of coarse
white fur when opened. This fur creeps up the user's arm
and across her entire body until she is completely covered
in a tangled pelt. While coated with this fur she gains
cold resistance 5, a +2 natural armor bonus to AC, and a
+4 competence bonus on Stealth checks in areas of ice
and snow. This fur sheds from her body after 24 hours, or
can be removed early by soaking it in alcohol. The flask is
expended after one use.
