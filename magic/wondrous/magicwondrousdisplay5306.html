Description

This violet shawl twists and melds with the darkness, becoming as black as coal in even the faintest shadow. While worn, the wearer can hide her appearance as if with a penumbral disguise spell (see page 29). Onlookers never discern that the wearer was wearing a shawl of shadowy disguise.
