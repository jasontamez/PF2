Description

This torch is made of pale yellow wood and inscribed with holy
runes. When lit, it burns as a regular torch, but only lasts for 5
minutes. When held by a lawful good creature, it functions as
an archon's aura spell. The magical aura ends if a lawful good
creature isn't holding it, and resumes automatically if a lawful
good creature holds it again.
