Description

These thin gloves are covered in reflective glyphs and sigils, and the palms are slightly tacky. Like gloves of arrow snaring, twice per day the wearer can act as if she had the Snatch Arrow feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites for that feat. In addition, the wearer can expend one of this item's uses per day to use the Snatch Arrows feat on a projectile targeting an ally in a space adjacent to her.

As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power and one of this item's uses per day to block a spell targeting her or an adjacent ally, as the parry spell guardian path ability (see page 30).

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Crafter, shield, spell turning, creator must have the parry spell path ability; Cost 4,500 gp
