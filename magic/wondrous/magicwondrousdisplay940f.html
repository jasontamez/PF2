Description

This potent item is a 3-inch-diameter rusty
iron sphere wrapped in iron bands.


When the proper command word is
spoken and the spherical iron device is
hurled at an opponent, the bands expand
and then contract to bind the target creature
on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller
creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned)
until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into
spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC
30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. Iron bands of
binding are usable once per day.
