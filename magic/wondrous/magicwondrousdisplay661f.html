Description

This life-sized scarecrow is garbed
in old clothing and armor. At its
center is the real skeleton of a
former adventurer. A scarecrow
lure is enchanted to writhe and
cry out for help as if wounded.
The lure's voice is usually that of
the adventurer whose remains are
inside, though the creator may
choose any voice when creating the item. Anyone who hears
or sees a scarecrow lure can attempt a DC 11 Will save to
disbelieve the effect. Activating a scarecrow lure is a standard
action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
