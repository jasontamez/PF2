Description

This elixir, derived from ambergris and cytillesh fungus, is used by spies, secret agents, and hidden cultists to erase their own memories if they might become a liability to themselves or their allies. When drinking the elixir, the drinker can select one event or specific piece of information (such as the password to enter a thieves' guild, the secret identity of a local vigilante, or the location of stashed loot) to forget (Will DC 14 negates). The forgotten memory can be restored only with a modify memory spell or similar effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment.
