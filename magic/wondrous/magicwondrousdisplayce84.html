Description

These soft leather boots smell strongly of marsh gas, and leave faint wet prints behind even when they're dry. Despite these aesthetic flaws, bogstrider boots are of great use in areas of swampy terrain. They provide the wearer the ability to move without penalty in squares of shallow or deep bog (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427), and the DCs of Acrobatics checks attempted by the boots' wearer are unchanged in squares of shallow bog. In addition, three times per day when the wearer takes a charge or withdraw action, she can increase her speed by 60 feet for 1 round.
