Description

Appearing to be nothing more than a ratty
wool robe with a hood, this garment is an
invaluable tool for spies, thieves, and
smugglers. On command, the wearer and
non-living objects up to her maximum load
are sucked into an extradimensional space
within the robe, leaving the robe to
collapse where the wearer was standing.
The robe appears to be merely a pile of discarded clothes,
and does not detect as magical or function so long as the
wearer is within the extradimensional space.


While inside the extradimensional space, the wearer cannot
take most actions, but can breathe comfortably for up to 24 hours.
The wearer can see the area around the robe, though special
senses such as darkvision or blindsense do not function. The
wearer may leave the extradimensional space with a thought
as a free action-the only action he can make while inside the
extradimensional space. He reappears wearing the robe once
more. However, if there is not enough room for the wearer to
reappear (for example, if the robe was placed inside a small box)
then the wearer cannot leave the extradimensional space.


If the robe is destroyed or its magic suppressed while the
wearer is within the extradimensional space, or if he spends 24
hours within it, he and all objects inside reappear instantaneously
in the robe's space, and the wearer is dazed for one round.
