Description

Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth,
this cloak bestows a +5 competence
bonus on Stealth checks. The wearer
is also able to hang upside down from
the ceiling like a bat.


By holding the edges of the
garment, the wearer is able to fly as
per the spell (including a +7 bonus
on Fly skill checks). If he desires, the wearer can actually
polymorph himself into an ordinary bat and fly accordingly (as
beast shape III). All possessions worn or carried are part of the
transformation. Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can
be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky
or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground).
Either of the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes at a
time, but after a flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow
any flying power for a like period of time.
