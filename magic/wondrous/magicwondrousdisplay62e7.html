This violet and yellow silk robe gives the impression of
electricity crackling over its surface. The robe grants the wearer
electricity resistance 5 and increases the wearer's caster level
for all spells with the electricity descriptor by +1. Once per day
on command, the wearer of the robe can emit a 20-foot-radius
burst of electricity. Creatures other than the wearer within the
area take 2d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half).
