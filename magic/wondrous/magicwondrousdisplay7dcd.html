Description

The wearer can spend a full-round action concentrating to change the color of this short, silken cape to match any attire or mood. When using the derring-do 1st-level swashbuckler deed, the wearer adds an additional die when rolling either a natural 5 or 6 rather than just a natural 6. Additionally, the cape grants a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This bonus increases to +4 for 1 round each time the wearer uses the charmed life swashbuckler class feature.
