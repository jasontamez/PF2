Description

Strapped to the hands, these spiked climbing claws grant a +2
competence bonus on Climb checks and Acrobatics checks made
when using both hands to aid in movement, and allow the
wearer to ignore the normal penalties on those skills for slippery
or icy surfaces. In addition, up to 3 times per day, the wearer can
activate the claws as a swift action to gain the benefits of spider
climb for 1 round. The wearer cannot hold anything else in her
hands while using claws of the ice bear. If used as a weapon,
claws of the ice bear function as spiked gauntlets.
