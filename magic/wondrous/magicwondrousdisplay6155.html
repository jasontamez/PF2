Description

The lens of this classical monocle is made of carefully shaped Shory glass. By looking through the lens, a wearer of a jungle seeker's monocle can find hidden creatures even in the thickest of jungles. The wearer can use Perception to detect the presence of other living creatures up to 3d6 ??10 feet away in any forest, treating it as if it were a sparse forest (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 426). The monocle also grants a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice creatures using Stealth, regardless whether the wearer is in a forest or elsewhere.
