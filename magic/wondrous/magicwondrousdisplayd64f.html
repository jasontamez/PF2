Description

This silvery cape furls and ripples
like a flag with every step its
owner takes. As a swift action,
the wearer can order the cape to
transform into a faint sphere of
force that surrounds him on all
sides. The field grants the wearer
concealment (20% miss chance)
against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the
wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the
cloak, whichever comes first. When the field is used, all magic
is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment.
