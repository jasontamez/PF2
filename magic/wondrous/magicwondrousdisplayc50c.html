Description

The wearer of these simple gloves can
speak a command word create a glowing
disembodied hand. As a swift action, the
wearer can have the hand assist him with
a task as if using the aid another action.
The hand uses the wearer's base attack
bonus or skill ranks when making the check to see if aid another is
successful (it does not gain the benefit of the wearer's ability scores
or other bonuses). The hand remains until it has attempted one
action or until 1 minute passes, whichever comes first, at which
time the gloves become nonmagical.
