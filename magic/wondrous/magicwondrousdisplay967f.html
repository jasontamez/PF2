Description

This simple headband of braided hide grants a +5
competence bonus on Survival checks and inures the
wearer to the strain of long travel, as the tireless pursuit
spell (Advanced Player's Guide). If the wearer is a ranger,
the hunter's band increases his favored enemy bonus on
attack rolls by +1 for all his favored enemies. If the ranger
has the hunter's bond (companions) class feature, this
increase also applies to the attack roll bonus his allies gain
from that ability.
