Description

The wearer of these slippers may walk on air (as the spell
air walk) for up to 10 minutes per day, which may be used
in 1-minute increments and requires no action to activate.
However, she may only walk on air within or on top of
natural or magical mist or fog, including fog-like gases
such as those created by acid fog, cloudkill, incendiary
cloud, or stinking cloud. Walking on top of such clouds
carries no danger for the wearer, but walking through the
cloud has its normal effect.
