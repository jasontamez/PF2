Description

Often used by the halflings of Segada looking to escape their insular home city and satisfy their wanderlust, these maps appear as ordinary parchment. A user of a wanderlust map can spend 1 uninterrupted hour holding the map and thinking about exploring a region within 1,000 miles. After this time has passed, the wanderlust map turns into a detailed map of that area, granting a +5 bonus on exploration checks in that region. A wanderlust map shows only geographical features of a specific area. Once a wanderlust map has turned into a detailed map, it cannot be used to map a different region.
