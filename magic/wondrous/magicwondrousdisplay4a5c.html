Description

This small iron cage is engraved with dozens of ancient funerary runes. On opposing sides of the cage frame, two large bolts can be adjusted to hold a humanoid head in a stationary position within. When a head is placed inside and the command word is spoken, you can sequester information from it as if it were under the effect of a speak with dead spell. The cage can coerce three answers per day, which do not need to be from the same head or asked in a limited period of time (for example, you could ask a kobold's head a question in the morning, an orc's head a question in the afternoon, and an ogre's head a question in the evening).
