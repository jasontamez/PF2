Description

This stylish silk shirt has a loose and flowing fit except for the sleeves, which cling snugly to the wearer's arms from elbow to wrist. The sleeves guide the wearer's attacks to take advantage of brief gaps in a foe's defenses. Five times per day, the wearer can make a lunging melee maneuver and extend his reach by 5 feet for a single melee attack. If the wearer has the Lunge feat, he can instead use that feat five times per day without taking the normal -2 penalty.
