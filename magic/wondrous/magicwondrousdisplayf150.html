Description

This collection of gruesome anatomical diagrams is bound in leather that shifts slightly under the reader's fingertips. The book's many illustrations provide information about how to best wound a variety of creature types, and the book emits light equivalent to that of a candle within 5 feet, allowing it to be read in the dark. The owner can use this folio to gain a +5 bonus on Knowledge checks to identify a creature's special powers or vulnerabilities. A monster killer's folio has a tendency to quickly open to the appropriate page when consulted, as though eager to provide information that will lead to violence. Additionally, once per day the book can be used to cast discovery torch.
