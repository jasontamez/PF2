Description

If the possessor learns the proper tune, he can use these
pipes to attract 1d3 rat swarms if any rats are within 400 feet.
For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a
1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats
appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10
Perform (wind instruments) check. Success means that they
obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues
to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any
reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately.
The Perform DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have
been successfully called in a 24-hour period.


If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the
HD of the controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is
assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if
the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.
