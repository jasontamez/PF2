Description

This single, jade-encrusted ironwood pauldron glistens slightly, as if it were the reflective surface of a still pool, even in complete darkness. This pauldron increases the virulence of all poisons used by the wearer. Once per day, when attempting to poison a target, the wearer can speak a command word to magically enhance a single dose of poison, making it immune to the effects of delay poison. The poison's DC is unaffected and the poison can still be affected by a neutralize poison spell and similar magical effects.
