Description

This walrus-shaped charm is typically carved from ivory or bone. When targeted by a witch's hex or an effect with the curse descriptor, the wearer can activate this charm as an immediate action to gain a +3 resistance bonus on the saving throw to resist the curse effect. If the wearer is affected by the curse effect, he gains a +2 bonus on any subsequent saving throws to resist the effect for up to 1 week, and he gains a +3 bonus on any caster level checks he attempts to remove the effect (such as with remove curse) during this time.

This charm can only be used once, after which the charm's magic is gone forever. A charm occupies the wearer's shoulders or neck slot, though it can share that slot with one other magic item (as a cloak pin or token hanging from a necklace, for example). A character can never wear more than one charm at a time.
