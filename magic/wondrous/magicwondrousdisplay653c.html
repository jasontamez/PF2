Description

A wooden roof and walls line this horse-drawn caravan wagon. By uttering a command word, the wagon's owner can change the color and patterns that cover the wagon's sides, creating text or images, or can cause one wall to unfold into a stage. The home away's interior contains foldaway beds, desks, and cupboards, and can accommodate up to six Medium creatures. The interior is always warm and dry regardless of outside conditions, protecting anyone within from any weather short of hurricane-force winds.

Once per week, the home away's owner can pull the wagon's kingbolt, causing it to unfurl into a 60-foot-wide tent with the same coloration as the wagon. The owner can declare a purpose for the tent as she pulls the bolt'such as celebration, meetings, performance, or wilderness survival-and the tent creates bleachers, tables, beds, and other simple furniture to accommodate this purpose.
