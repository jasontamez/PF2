Description

This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to wire than
fabric. When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem
or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature
and a successful DC 20 Heal or Spellcraft check), the
stitches change the creature's damage reduction to DR 5/
adamantine and slashing. Variant zombies lacking damage
reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR 5/slashing.
One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the
creature being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of
lengths has no effect. A full thimble of embalming thread
contains 20 lengths.


If the skill check to use the stitches fails, they are not
wasted, but must first be cleaned and unknotted, requiring
1 hour per stitch. Once used successfully, the stitches cannot
be reused.
