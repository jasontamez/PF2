Description

Meant to be worn around the neck, this medallion made of braided, blue-tinged white gold hangs from a silver chain. When a creature with the demon subtype uses its summoning ability with 100 feet of the medallion's wearer, it must attempt a concentration check with a DC equal to 15 + double the level of its summon ability. If the summoner fails this concentration check, none of the summoned creatures appear, and the use of the demon's summon ability is wasted. On a successful concentration check, the number of creatures that the demon summons (if any) is reduced to 1.
