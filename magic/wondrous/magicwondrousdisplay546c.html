Description

This banded agate attaches itself
to its wearer's forehead and then,
blinking and focusing, begins to act
as an additional eye. When worn, the
veiled eye has the same vision as
the wearer (such as low-light vision,
darkvision 60 ft., or the oracle's clouded vision curse). It
grants the wearer no particular advantages so long as
his original eyes continue to function normally. However,
should his original eyes stop working, whether because
of the wearer becoming blinded or even his own decision
to close them, he can see through the veiled eye instead.
When the wearer is using the veiled eye as his only vision
source, he takes a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls but
gains a +2 insight bonus on saves against gaze attacks.
