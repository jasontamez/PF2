Description

This porcelain teacup is used by poisoners to administer lethal doses to even the most suspicious of victims. When a dose of ingested poison is placed in the toastmaster's teacup and a command word is spoken, the cup absorbs the poison so it cannot be detected. When the teacup's user speaks a second command word (it need not be the same user), the poison reappears and taints any liquid within the cup.
