Description

Made specifically for those who frequently navigate the mazelike tunnels that wind throughout Nar-Voth, these compasses are made from stone sourced from the Darklands. However, instead of featuring the four cardinal directions, the compass's circumference is adorned with several small pictographs. To use a cavern compass, the bearer must be at an intersection of tunnels or caverns somewhere underground, and must hold it in his hand and speak the name of his desired destination. The destination must be well known enough to be likely to appear on a map of the area, such as a settlement or a prominent ruin, or else must be a location with which the holder is intimately familiar. For the next mile, the needle of the cavern compass points down whichever passageway most efficiently leads to the chosen destination.

Additionally, if the passage contains any of the following hazards over the course of 1 mile, a corresponding pictograph glows with a faint light: magma, molds or slimes, radiation, sudden vertical passages, or water hazards. If a passage further splits into multiple pathways within 1 mile, the cavern compass selects whichever one results in being closest to the destination after 1 mile and provides information about hazards only down that route.
