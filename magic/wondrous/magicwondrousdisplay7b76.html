Description

This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered
graphite. When stared at, however, the dust changes color and
form. A creature covered in dust of illusion is affected as if by a
disguise self glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust
envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a
DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.
