Description

Each end of this unassuming, 8-inch leather cord is adorned by a polished silver bead. A wand around which a holdout wand wrap has been wound and tied (a standard action) can be commanded to change its shape and appearance to assume the form of another object of a similar size and shape (such as a feather, a folded fan, or a spoon). The wand retains all its properties (including its weight) when so disguised but does not radiate magic. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of a wand disguised by a holdout wand wrap. Whenever the disguised wand is activated, the holdout wand wrap's effects are suppressed for 1 minute.
