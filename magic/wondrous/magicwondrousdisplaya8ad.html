Description

If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a
command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours
out. Separate command words determine the type of water as
well as the volume and velocity.
<ul><li>"Stream" pours out 1 gallon per round.
</li><li>"Fountain" produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.
</li><li>"Geyser" produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30
gallons per round.</li></ul>
The geyser effect exerts considerable pressure, requiring the
holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked
down each round the effect is maintained. In addition, the
powerful force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage per
round to a creature that is subjected to it. The geyser can only
affect one target per round, but the user can direct the beam of
water without needing to make an attack roll to strike the target
since the geyser's constant flow allows for ample opportunity to
aim. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d4 points of damage
per round from the geyser rather than 1d4. The command word
must be spoken to stop it.
