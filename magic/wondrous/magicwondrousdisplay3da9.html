Description

Once the command word is spoken, this 5-foot-diameter loop
of wire blends with its surroundings. To find it, a character with
the trapfinding ability must succeed at a DC 30 Perception check.
Setting the snare is a full-round action that provokes attacks of
opportunity. Any creature that steps into the snare must succeed
at a DC 26 Will save or become magically paralyzed, as the spell
hold monster. This effect can be ended by uttering the command
word, succeeding at a DC 30 Disable Device check, or succeeding
at the Will save. The snare is destroyed when the effect ends.
