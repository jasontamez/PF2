Description

If this belt's wearer has at least one hand free (holding
nothing), he can attempt to deflect a successful melee attack
with an immediate action. To do so, he rolls an unarmed strike
against the opponent, including any applicable modifiers
such as a favored enemy bonus or the penalty for Power
Attack. If his attack roll is greater than the opponent's attack
roll, the attack is negated without effect. The unarmed strike
itself causes no damage and does not count as a successful
attack against the opponent. The opponent does not need
to be within the wearer's reach to use this ability. Whether
the attack succeeds or not, the wearer takes a -4 penalty on
attack rolls until the end of his next turn.
