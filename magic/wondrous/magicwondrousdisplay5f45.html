Description

A flying sled is a small vehicle akin to a rowboat, and is covered in metallic veins. The sled can hold one occupant. A psychic pilot can the control the craft. Without a psychic pilot, a flying sled acts in all regards as a rowboat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 185).

A control helmet that fits a Small or Medium creature is linked by cables to the metal veins of the sled. When a psychic creature (one with levels in an occult class, the Psychic Sensitivity feat, or the ability to use psychic spell-like abilities) wears the control helmet, the flying sled gains the following abilities. <ul><li>The sled can fly with a maximum speed of 100 feet and acceleration of 30 feet.</li><li>The sled gains fast healing 2 when reduced below half its starting hit points. Damage above this threshold must be repaired normally.</li></ul> Along with the abilities granted to the flying sled when piloted by a psychic creature, the pilot gains the following additional ability. <ul><li>Once per day, the pilot can take a full-round action to transport herself and the flying sled between the Astral Plane and the Material Plane. This ability otherwise functions as plane shift.</li></ul>
