Description

This thin iron chain holds up to 10 extracted teeth of common predatory animals strung along it. As a move action, the wearer can place up to three teeth into a thrown splash weapon or an alchemist's bomb. When such a splash weapon or bomb hits a target, it deals an additional 1d4 points of slashing damage per tooth used. Each tooth used in such a splash weapon or bomb also increases its splash damage by 2 points of slashing damage per tooth. Once all of the necklace's teeth are used in this way, the necklace's magic is expended. A newly purchased necklace of bloody incisors contains 10 extracted teeth.
