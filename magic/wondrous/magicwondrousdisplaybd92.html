Description

A single dose of these dried tea leaves is enough to brew a cup of savory tea for one creature, who then becomes susceptible to suggestion for 1 hour after drinking the tea. During this time, anyone can suggest a course of activity to the drinker, who carries out the order to the best of his ability, as suggestion (Will DC 14 negates). In addition, the character drinking the tea has no recollection of the time spent carrying out the compulsion.
