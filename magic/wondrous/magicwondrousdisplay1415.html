Description

The dark cosmetic in this small decorative tube is made from finely ground minerals. Favored by Osirian men and women alike, nonmagical kohl is applied around the eyes and is used to reduce the glare from the desert sun, and cosmetically to cause the whites of the wearer's eyes to stand out distinctly.

When applied to the eyes, kohl of uncanny discernment grants its wearer low-light vision and a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks. If the wearer already has low-light vision, the kohl doubles the distance the wearer can see. The wearer also gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks, patterns, visual effects, and sightbased attacks. These effects last for 1 hour. Applying the kohl is a full-round action, and it must be applied to both eyes to function. An unopened tube of kohl of uncanny discernment contains 5 applications.
