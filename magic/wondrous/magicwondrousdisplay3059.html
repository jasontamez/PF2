Description

When the end of this gray hemp rope is held and the command
word is uttered, it is irrevocably transmuted into solid iron. The
transmuted rope loses all magic and has the hardness and hit
points of a normal inch-thick iron bar. When crafted, the rope is
25 feet long, but can be cut up to three times and each section of
rope can be commanded to harden individually.
