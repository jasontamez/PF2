Description

This elbow-length, heavy leather glove's fine embroidery is
marred by dozens of claw marks. Once per day on command, its
wearer can gesture toward a creature within 30 feet. When he
does, a featureless silhouette of a bird of prey appears, swoops
toward the target, and performs a disarm or steal combat
maneuver (wearer's choice, CMB +16). The shadow falcon is a
magical effect, not a creature, and this action does not provoke
attacks of opportunity. If the hand wearing the glove is empty,
the shadow falcon brings the item to the wearer's hand. If the
gloved hand is occupied, the shadow falcon deposits the item on
the ground in an unoccupied space adjacent to the wearer. The
shadow falcon then disappears.
