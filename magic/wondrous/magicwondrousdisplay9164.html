Description

Not all who board Ulfen longships or travel the paths of Kellid mammoth hunters are capable warriors, even though they may be just as brave. A cloak of the saga keeper is made from layers of fox fur and leather cut in strips reminiscent of fluttering lengths of scroll. Seven of these strips are dyed vibrant red. The wearer of the cloak constantly benefits from the effects of endure elements while in cold conditions, and gains resist energy 2 against cold damage. Additionally, the wearer of the cloak can, as an immediate action, pluck one of the cloak's seven dyed strips to gain a +6 bonus to a Climb, Handle Animal, Ride, Survival, or Swim check made that round. These strips dissolve immediately upon being plucked. Once all seven of the cloak's strips have been torn off, the wearer can no longer maker use of the cloak's skill-improving effects, but continues to benefit from the endure elements and resistance abilities.
