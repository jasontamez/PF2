This cylindrical felt hat, favored by Dawnflower dervishes, grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on one Knowledge or Perform skill, chosen when the dervish sikke is created. Most dervish sikkes grant bonuses on Knowledge (religion) or Perform (dance) checks.

If the wearer is a bard, he is considered 5 class levels higher for purposes of determining the effects of his bardic knowledge class feature. In addition, the bonuses granted by a bard's inspire courage and inspire competence class features are increased by 1. Finally, a bard wearing a dervish sikke can take 10 on any Perform skill check he has ranks in.
