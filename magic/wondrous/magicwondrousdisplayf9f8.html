Description

Crystal balls of the dark void look like dark-colored crystal balls. Upon inspection, most appear to be filled with roiling clouds of midnight blue smoke, but some seem to contain motes of light that evoke the night sky. This item functions as a standard crystal ball, but can be used to cast sending once per day targeting any creature observed in the crystal ball.

Once per month, the user can attempt to use a crystal ball of the dark void to contact a flying creature from the depths of space called a shantak (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 244). The user must attempt at a DC 25 Spellcraft check. If the attempt to contact a shantak is successful, the monster flies to the location where the user was when contact was made. It arrives there in 3d20 hours, at which point the user must use Diplomacy or magic to compel the shantak to serve him. Failure to do so (or failure to meet the shantak) causes the angry shantak to remain in the area for 2d6 hours, attacking anything that comes near.

Every time a crystal ball of the dark void is used, there's a 5% chance that the item doesn't work as intended and instead reveals glimpses of alien horrors from the depths of the Dark Tapestry to the user, who must immediately attempt a DC 20 Will save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain.
