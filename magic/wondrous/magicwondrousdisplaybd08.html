Description

This sinister item functions much like
a robe of useful items, but specifically
for the serious necromancer. It
appears to be an unremarkable
robe, but a character who dons it
notes that it is adorned with small
embroidered figures representing
undead creatures. Only the wearer
of the robe can see the embroidery,
recognize them as the creatures
they become, and detach them. One
figure can be detached each round. Detaching a figure causes
it to become an actual undead creature (see the list below).
The skeleton or zombie is not under the control of the wearer
of the robe, but may be subsequently commanded, rebuked,
turned, or destroyed. A newly created robe of bones always
has two embroidered figures of each of the following undead:
<ul><li>Human skeleton
</li><li>Wolf skeleton
</li><li>Heavy horse skeleton
</li><li>Fast goblin zombie
</li><li>Tough human zombie
</li><li>Plague ogre zombie</li></ul>
