Description

Not every adventurer returns to the tavern, and Cayden's Hall has seen many a drink raised in remembrance of a fallen comrade. A parting glass, engraved with the names of adventuring companies and their honored dead, is a rare gift given by senior priests of Cayden Cailean's church to survivors of quests that fit with the church's ideals but demanded a high cost.

Once per day when used in a toast with at least one other creature, a single creature drinking from a parting glass gains a +5 morale bonus on the next saving throw it attempts within 24 hours, and one poison (other than alcohol) currently affecting the drinker is targeted by neutralize poison.
