Description

When this bridle of crystal-studded white leather is placed on a horse or similar mount, the animal's eyes emit a bright azure glow and its hair glistens with magical frost. A frostwild bridle provides cold resistance 20 to its wearer. Also, three times per day on the rider's command, the animal wearing a frostwild bridle can breathe a 60-foot cone of frost that deals 9d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in the area. A successful DC 17 Reflex save halves the damage.
