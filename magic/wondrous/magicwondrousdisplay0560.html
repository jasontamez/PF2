Description

This silvery cloak has steel
pauldrons built into it, and always
seems to fit a little too loosely,
no matter who happens to be
wearing it. At the start of each
day, the owner of a mantle of the
protector may spend 10 minutes
attuning the mantle to his armor
and shield. He may then lend his
attuned mantle to an ally, who
can activate it as an immediate
action at any time to gain the owner's armor and shield
bonus as well as any other special properties the armor may
have for 10 minutes. When the mantle is activated this way,
the owner's armor and shield go dormant, and he loses any
benefits they may provide for 1 minute.
