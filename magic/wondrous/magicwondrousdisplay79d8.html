Description

This dirty, tattered-looking gray coat would not look out of place wrapped around a drifter or vagrant. When the wearer speaks the command word, the coat of the undercity shifts into a wave of clacking chitin, transforming the wearer into a giant cockroach (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 58) as vermin shape I. This transformation can occur only in an urban environment. The wearer can remain transformed for up to 5 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.
