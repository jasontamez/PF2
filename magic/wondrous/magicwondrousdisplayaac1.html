Description

Once per day on command, the wearer of these oxblood
leather gloves can bend space to extend her reach to a nonadjacent
square within line of sight. For the next 10 rounds,
she can touch anything in that square as if it were her own
square, as long as she has line of effect to the target square.
She may change the targeted square as a swift action.


When using the gloves to touch, attack, or manipulate
anything in the square, the wearer's arms and hands also
appear in that square, allowing creatures and effects to
target her as if she were in that square. She cannot use this
connection to transfer anything from her square to the target
square, or vice versa. If she drops anything, it lands in her
square. She can use her hands (including natural attacks from
those hands, if any), hand-held objects (such as lockpicks),
and melee weapons in that square as if she were there. The
square is part of her threatened area, though she cannot use
the gloves to provide flanking for herself. She cannot use the
gloves to grapple, make ranged attacks, or make attacks that
require her to move out of her actual square (such as a bull
rush combat maneuver).


Interacting with the target square is distracting, and
anything that threatens her in her actual square automatically
flanks her.


If the wearer or her square is blocked from using
teleportation or planar travel effects (such as dimensional
anchor), the gloves do not function. She cannot use the gloves
to target a square protected by such an effect.
