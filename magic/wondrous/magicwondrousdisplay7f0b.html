Description

A leshy mulch manual is a fragile, bark-bound book containing a dozen pages of coarse, grainy paper. The book includes information and incantations that help in crafting a leshy. The instructions grant a +3 competence bonus on skill checks made to create a leshy, reduce the number of ranks in Knowledge (nature) needed to create a leshy by 2, and allow the user to treat her caster level as 2 higher for the purposes of creating a leshy. The book can also be chopped up and mixed into the soil used to grow a leshy, replacing the normal crafting cost for the leshy. When a leshy is cultivated from this soil, a spirit is automatically lured into the body, with no percentile roll required.
