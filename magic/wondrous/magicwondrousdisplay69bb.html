Description

The thick liquid in this ceramic jar smells sickly sweet. To
activate its powers, the user it must be unstopper the jar
as a standard action while thinking deeply about a specific
person or object that she has seen at least once from up to
30 feet away. When then poured onto the ground, the syrup
flows at 15 feet per round following the most direct route
to the creature or object visualized, provided the creature or
object is on the same plane, leaving behind a sticky trail. The
syrup can flow uphill or even up stairs and can pass through
openings as narrow as one-sixteenth of an inch. It cannot
penetrate other liquids or porous or absorbent surfaces (such
as sand or sawdust).
