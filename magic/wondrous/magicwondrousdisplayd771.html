Description

Named for Nashina aj-Salihar, the Sarenite monk who penned the original work, this hefty tome contains inspiring parables, simple folk remedies for widespread illnesses and injuries, and helpful hints for dealing with common monsters. Its pages are expertly illuminated with brilliant inks and metallic foil, depicting scenes of angels battling various monstrosities. While in possession of this book, the owner gains a +2 sacred bonus on Heal checks and Knowledge skill checks to identify the abilities and weaknesses of monsters.

If Sarenrae is the owner's patron, the owner may instead choose to gain a sacred bonus equal to her Wisdom or Charisma modifier on these skill checks instead of the normal +2 bonus.
