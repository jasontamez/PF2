Description

These vambraces change their
appearance depending on who wears
them. If the wearer is a cavalier, these
vambraces display the symbol of his
order. When unworn or in the hands
of a non-cavalier, they appear to be
an ordinary pair of steel vambraces.
A cavalier wearing these vambraces is considered two class
levels higher for purposes of determining the effects of his
challenge class feature. Furthermore, once per day as a swift
action, a cavalier with the tactician class feature can increase
the area in which he grants teamwork feats. Before the end of
his next turn, when the cavalier grants his allies a teamwork
feat, he can grant it to all allies within 60 feet, though they
must still be able to see and hear him.
