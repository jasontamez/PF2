Description

Upon activation, this pulsing white pebble creates an instantaneous
burst of reverse gravity, which clears a 5-foot-diameter sphere
of any loose stone or earth. The displacing stone then holds the
affected stone or earth in place, keeping a collapsed tunnel clear
for 1 minute. Once the duration ends, the loose earth collapses
if it's not supported. Displacing stones are destroyed when used,
and don't affect living creatures. Activating a displacing stone is a
standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
