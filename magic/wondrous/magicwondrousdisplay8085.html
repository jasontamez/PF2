Description

This fan, a favorite tool of courtiers and courtesans, is usually decorated with a delicate design of flowers or geometric patterns. Once per day, the wielder can use the fan to attempt to completely infatuate a humanoid target, causing it to stare deeply into the wielder's eyes and ignore everything else around it. The wielder utters a command word and holds the fan in front of his face, flourishing it and peering over its top to make eye contact with the target. The target must succeed at a DC 11 Will save or fall under the combined effects of the hypnotism and lock gaze spells. The effects last for 5 rounds or until the wielder dismisses it by closing the fan. Afterward, the target is charmed by the fan's user for 1 hour (as charm person).
