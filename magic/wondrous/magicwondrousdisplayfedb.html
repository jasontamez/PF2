Description

This colorful mask evokes the image of the Rabbit Prince from the Harrowed Realm. It covers the top half of the wearer's face and depicts the countenance of a resolute rabbit complete with large, floppy felt ears. Despite its apparently fragile construction, the mask is as tough as iron (hardness 10). The mask of the rabbit prince imparts reckless bravado, granting the wearer a +2 morale bonus on initiative checks and on saving throws against fear effects. In addition, the wearer always counts as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump.
