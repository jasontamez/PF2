Description

This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm. When
this is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon, but can be
removed from that weapon with a full-round action. A firearm
wielder using a firearm that has this sight can choose to spend a
full-round action to either locate an invisible creature within line
of sight or make a single shot that ignores the invisibility of a
creature that she knows is in the area.
