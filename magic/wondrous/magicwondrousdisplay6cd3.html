Description

This elaborate circlet of gold-and-platinum filigree bears tiny
gems in settings that look disturbingly like human eyes.
When worn, the circlet lets the wearer sense the presence of
other thinking creatures in her immediate area. The wearer
gains the benefits of blindsense 30 feet, but only against
creatures with an Intelligence score that are susceptible to
mind-affecting effects.


Undead, constructs, and mindless creatures like most
oozes and vermin cannot be perceived when using the circlet,
nor can creatures under the effects of mind blank or a ring of
mind shielding.


The circlet does not interfere with the wearer's ability to
see normally. If the wearer has blindsense or blindsight, he
is able to differentiate creatures detected with those senses
from creatures detected with the circlet of mindsight.
