Description

This clean-smelling white candle is inscribed with glyphs
portraying various sweet smelling flowers. When lit, the
candle repels smoke, mist, cloud, and other gas effects in a
5-foot radius. These effects do not penetrate the area around
the candle if they are of spell level 3 or lower. Against more
powerful cloud effects (including effects not based on spells,
such as dragon breath or a gorgon's breath weapon), the
candle grants creatures in the area a +4 resistance bonus
on saving throws against these effects. Creatures in the
area gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from
creatures with the air subtype.


The candle burns for up to 5 minutes, in increments of 1
minute. Once all 5 minutes are used, the candle is destroyed.
