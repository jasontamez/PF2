Description

Made from the preserved skins of plague victims, this cloak functions as a +1 cloak of resistance. If the wearer is infected with a disease, he can also command the mantle to cast virulent miasma once per day. Additionally, as a standard action, a diseased wearer can make a touch attack. If it hits, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract one disease the wearer currently has (wearer's choice in the case of multiple diseases).
