Description

This device is a single leather glove. On
command, one item held in the hand
wearing the glove disappears. The item
can weigh no more than 20 pounds and
must be able to be held in one hand.
While stored, the item has negligible
weight. With a snap of the fingers wearing the glove, the item
reappears. A glove can only store one item at a time. Storing
or retrieving the item is a free action. The item is shrunk down
so small within the palm of the glove that it cannot be seen.
Spell durations are not suppressed, but continue to expire. If the
glove's effect is suppressed or dispelled, the stored item appears
instantly. A glove of storing uses up the wearer's entire hands
slot. The wearer may not use another item (even another glove
of storing) that also uses the hands slot.
