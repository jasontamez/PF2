Description

These gloves are made of goatskin reinforced with heavy iron strips. They provide a sure, strengthened grip on large or awkwardly shaped items. When the wearer wields an improvised melee weapon or inappropriately sized weapon, reduce the penalty for doing so by 2 (minimum 0). The gloves don't change the number of hands required to wield such a weapon.
