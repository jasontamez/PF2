Description

This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet,
although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving
swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize the spell
plane shift. However, this is a difficult item to master. The
user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the
amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on
that plane) that she desires. If she fails, the amulet transports
her and all those traveling with her to a random location on
that plane (01-60 on d%) or to a random plane (61-100).
