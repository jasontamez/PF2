Description

This charm is typically spherical in shape and a mottled amber in color. A natural inclusion in this amber charm gives it the appearance of an eye. When activated as a swift action, the lynx eye charm grants its wearer low-light vision for 3 minutes. If activated as a standard action, the charm instead grants its wearer the benefits of darkvision or see invisibility for 3 rounds.

This charm can only be used once, after which the charm's magic is gone forever. A charm occupies the wearer's shoulders or neck slot, though it can share that slot with one other magic item (as a cloak pin or token hanging from a necklace, for example). A character can never wear more than one charm at a time.
