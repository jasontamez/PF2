Description

Infused with the essence of destruction, a pinch of void dust
unmakes force effects. If sprinkled on or thrown at a force effect,
it acts as a dispel magic, unless the force effect is immune to
dispel magic, in which case it acts like disintegrate. Void dust
can be sprinkled on an adjacent force effect or thrown up to
10 feet. No attack roll is required. A single pinch affects only a
single force effect. A found container holds three pinches.
