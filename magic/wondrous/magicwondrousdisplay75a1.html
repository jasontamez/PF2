Description

When hammered into place this 9-inch iron spike creates an
illusion up to 15 feet high and in a 15-foot diameter centered
on the spike. The illusion can be of one of the following: a
small hillock of appropriate composition for the terrain, a pile
of mundane crates or barrels, a mound of rubble, or a small
structure (such as a cabin or canvas enclosure). The exact size and
specific parameters (such the composition of timber) are chosen
when the spike is placed. Interacting with the illusion grants a
Will save (DC 12) to disbelieve it.


Hammering the spike into place or removing it is a full-round
action. The spike can be used any number of times and its effects
last until removed.
