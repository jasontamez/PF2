Description

These gauntlets come in a variety of forms. Some are mostly
leather with small steel plates, and are suited for fine
swordplay. Others are fully articulated plate favored by knights
in full plate. On command, the wearer of the gauntlet can store
a single weapon he is holding in the gauntlets. When he does
so, a graven image of the weapon appears on the gauntlet's
plates. The wearer can store up to 10 weapons in the gauntlets
in this manner. Retrieving a weapon requires the wearer to
touch the image of the weapon he wants. Doing so is a swift
action. When a weapon is retrieved, it appears in the hands of
the wearer and any weapons the wearer had in his hands is
stored in the gauntlets. If there is no room in the gauntlet for the
weapons the wearer is holding, those weapons are dropped. The
gauntlets can only store weapons; other items cannot be placed
in the gauntlet.


Furthermore, three times per day on command, the gloves
affect the wearer as the greater heroism spell.
