Description

This simple cold iron circle has no
markings or ornamentation upon it,
and is always slightly cool to the touch.
The circle shields both the wearer's soul
and his identity from mystic intrusion.
The wearer is immune to effects that target souls (such as
trap the soul) or that would be foiled by a nondetection spell
(unlike nondetection, the diviner's caster cannot attempt a spell
resistance check to overcome this effect). If the wearer is slain,
he cannot be restored to life by magic (save by a miracle, wish,
or divine intervention) until the circlet is removed.
