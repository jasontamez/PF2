Description

This black leather headband has two small amber
gemstones set so they rest on the wearer's forehead. The
headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to
Intelligence. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the
first 24 hours the headband is worn. It also grants skill ranks
as a headband of vast intelligence, but always grants ranks
in a Knowledge skill.


As a swift action three times per day, the wearer can call
upon the headband to reveal the abilities and weaknesses
of a creature within line of sight. The headband fills the
wearer's mind with information as though the wearer had
made a Knowledge check with a natural roll of a 5, adding
her bonuses to the check as normal. At the start of her next
turn, the wearer receives additional information as though
she had made the check with a natural roll of 10. At the start
of her turn after that, the wearer receives a final piece of
information, treating her natural roll as 15.
