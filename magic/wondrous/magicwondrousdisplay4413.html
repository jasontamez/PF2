Description

Subtle, indefinable shapes ripple and flow when this deep
blue cloak moves, seemingly devouring any light falling upon
it. Once per day at the wearer's command, two large gray
tentacles emerge from the cloak near the shoulders. Each
tentacle can make a natural attack that deals 1d6 points of
bludgeoning damage, assuming the wear is Medium (the
damage of the tentacles scales by size of the wearer as a
tentacle natural attack; Bestiary 302). The tentacles have
10-foot reach and the grab monster special ability (Bestiary
301). In addition, the wearer gains a +4 competence bonus on
grapple maneuver checks with the tentacles. The tentacles
last for 1 minute.
