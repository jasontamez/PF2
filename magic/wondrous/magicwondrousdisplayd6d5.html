Description

This simple copper headband
has a small yellow gem set so
that when it rests upon the
forehead of the wearer, the
yellow gem sits perched on the wearer's brow as if it
were a third eye in the middle of her forehead. Often, the
headband contains additional designs to further accentuate
the appearance of a third, crystal eye.

The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus
to two mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or
Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability
bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn.

These bonuses are chosen when the headband is created
and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to
Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast
intelligence.
