Description

This wide belt grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength. In addition, the wearer can spend 1 ki point to use stone shape. When he uses this ability, he can instead choose to shape metal, but he can affect only one-tenth as much material. To shape a usable weapon out of metal or stone, the wearer must succeed at a Craft (weapons) check. Items created in this way can never be of masterwork quality.

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, bear's endurance, stone shape; Cost 12,500 gp
