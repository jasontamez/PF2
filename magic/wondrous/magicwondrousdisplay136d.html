Description

This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the
wearer's entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover
his face and drop to a huddling crouch. Any creature seeking to
directly attack him while he does this must make a DC 11 Will
save to do so (as the sanctuary spell). The wearer cannot see
or take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively
blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless. The
wearer can end his crouch simply by standing up or moving.
