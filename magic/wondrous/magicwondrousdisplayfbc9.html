Description

These wire spectacles are
fitted with several groundcrystal
filters on hinged arms,
any combination of which can
be moved in front of or away
from the lenses as a standard action (one, two, or all three lenses
may be positioned at the same time with one action). Each filter
grants a specific sense to the wearer when it is placed before
one of the lenses. Each set of filters can be used for 10 minutes
in 1-minute increments before losing its magical properties. The
three sets of lenses are as follows.

Green Lenses: Grant the wearer the benefits of detect magic.
The wearer doesn't need to concentrate to gain the benefits of
the spell as long as a source of magic remains in her line of sight
for the appropriate number of rounds.

Pink Lenses: Grant the wearer the benefits of see invisibility.

Purple Lenses: Grant the wearer darkvision out to a distance
of 60 feet. If the wearer already has darkvision, the range of
her darkvision increases by 60 feet while she uses these filters.
