Description

Two times per day, the wearer of these shoes can call forth
1d4 spirit servants to aid her. The spirit servants are invisible,
mindless, shapeless beings that act as servants summoned
by the unseen servant spell. The spirits return to the shoes
after 3 hours have passed. The wearer can choose to dismiss
one or more of the spirit servants early.


Once per day, the wearer can command the ghostly
spirits inside her haunted shoes to emerge and swirl around
her, making her difficult to target in combat. The wearer
gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 3 minutes. The
spirits cannot be harmed, but a true seeing spell ignores
the concealment effect. The concealment effect cannot be
activated while any of the spirits are currently being used as
unseen servants.
