Description

This featureless gray stone is perfectly smooth and flawlessly
polished. The bearer of an orb of pure law gains a +4 deflection
bonus to AC against attacks from chaotic creatures and a +4
resistance bonus on saving throws against polymorph effects,
effects with the chaotic descriptor, and effects that inflict the
confused condition.


When held in hand, the bearer of the orb may use detect
chaos and detect law at will. A lawful creature may hold the
orb in hand and command it to invoke dispel chaos and arrow
of law each once per day.


The orb bestows one permanent negative level on any
chaotic creature holding or carrying it. The negative level
remains as long as the creature has the orb and disappears
immediately when the orb is no longer held or carried. This
negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by
restoration spells) while the bearer has the orb.
