Description

This lime green pill is inedible but turns a potion into a cloud
of mist that can be shared by multiple creatures. When placed
inside a potion flask, the potion bubbles and froths itself into
a pungent 10-foot-radius cloud. Any creature within the cloud
when it appears gains the full effect of the potion. The cloud
has no effect on creatures that cannot breathe. A creature
may automatically resist the effects of the potion cloud
by momentarily holding its breath. Using the pill destroys
it and the potion. Each pill can only be used on potions of
a particular spell level; using it on a potion of a different
spell level has no effect (neither the potion nor the pill are
consumed). The vaporizer also works on alchemist infusions,
but not mutagens, extracts, or magical oils.
