Description

These supple gloves grant the
wearer a +4 bonus to her CMD
against disarm attacks, attempts
to sunder her wielded weapons,
and effects that cause her to lose
her grip on her weapons (such
as grease). The wearer doesn't drop held weapons when
panicked or stunned. If the wearer has the weapon training
class feature and is using an appropriate weapon, her weapon
training bonus increases by +2.
