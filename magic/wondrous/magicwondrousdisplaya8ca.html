Description

A bilious bottle appears to be a tightly stoppered container of water. It can be thrown as a splash weapon. When a bilious bottle is opened or shatters, the foul fluid inside immediately expands into a 30-foot-radius cloud of noxious vapors. These vapors are invisible, but any creature within the area of effect of the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn or suffer one of the following random effects. The vapors created by a bilious bottle dissipate after 1 minute, or automatically if exposed to anything more than a moderate wind. The vapors created by a bilious bottle are a poison effect.
