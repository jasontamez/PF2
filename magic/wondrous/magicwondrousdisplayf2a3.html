Description

These crystal lenses fit over the user's
eyes, enabling him to cast doom upon
those around him (one target per
round) as a gaze attack, except that
the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely
looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11
Will save are affected as by the doom spell. The wearer also
gains the additional power of a continual deathwatch effect
and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack
once per week. Both lenses must be worn for the magic item
to take effect.
