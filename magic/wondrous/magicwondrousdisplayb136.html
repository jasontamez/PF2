Description

These durable canvas and leather gloves
imbue the wearer with an instinctive
knowledge of mechanical devices. The
wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus
on Craft and Knowledge checks made to
repair or understand mechanical devices.


Once per day, the wearer may touch
a device and instantly analyze it, learning its purpose and
general method of operation, as well as diagnosing any
acute malfunctions of the device, but not its magical powers
or additional non-mechanical effects. For example, she
could touch a pressure plate and understand that stepping
on it would trigger a wall scythe trap attacking that square
and that the trap resets automatically, but not that the trap
includes a +1 flaming scythe coated in poison.
