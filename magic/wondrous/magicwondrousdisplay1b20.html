Description

This plain iron band protects its wearer from fear effects.
Whenever the wearer suffers a fear effect, she is merely
shaken (even if the effect would normally make the target
frightened or panicked). Furthermore, the subject gains a
+2 competence bonus on all Will saves against fear. If the
wearer has the bravery class feature, she is considered four
levels higher when determining that class feature's effect.
