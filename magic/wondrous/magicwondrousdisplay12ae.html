Description

This mummified dwarf hand hangs on a steel chain around a
character's neck, bringing the wearer more in tune with the
earth beneath her feet. If the wearer spends a standard action
concentrating on the hand, she gains tremorsense out to a
range of 30 feet until the start of her next turn. This ability only
allows her to sense creatures and objects that are in contact
with earth or stone.
