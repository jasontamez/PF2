Description

A character who dons this battered robe
notes that its patches rearrange into the
shapes of various helpful but mundane items.
Only the wearer of the robe can see the true
shapes of these patches, recognize them for
what items they become, and detach them.
One patch can be detached each round.
Detaching a patch causes it to become an
actual item, as indicated below. A newly created robe of useful
items always has two each of the following patches:
<ul><li>Dagger
</li><li>Bullseye lantern (full and lit)
</li><li>Mirror (a highly polished 2-foot-by-4-foot steel mirror)
</li><li>Pole (10-foot length)
</li><li>Hempen rope (50-foot coil)
</li><li>Sack</li></ul>
In addition, the robe has several other patches. Roll 4d4 for
the number of other patches and then roll for each patch on
the table below to determine its nature.
