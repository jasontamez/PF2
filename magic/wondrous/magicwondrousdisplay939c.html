Description

If this seemingly unremarkable utensil is placed in an empty
container, the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although the
gruel tastes like warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing
and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous,
omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce
sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.
