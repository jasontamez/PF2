Description

This book is bound in dyed
goatskin, and its coarse, thick
pages are stained in a variety of
colors and covered in wavering
script; rough sketches; and
diagrams of various plants, mystic symbols, and animal parts. A crude wooden spoon
serves a bookmark. A cookbook of arcane augmentation
contains recipes that allow an arcane spellcaster who prepares
spells to augment her spells with specific metamagic effects
through ritual preparation. A cookbook of arcane augmentation
contains recipes for Ectoplasmic Spell, Persistent Spell,
Rime Spell, and Sickening Spell, and can be used to
augment spells of 6th level or lower.

Once per day, the spellcaster can augment a spell by
following a recipe as part of her normal spell preparation. To
prepare an augmented spell, the spellcaster must succeed
at a Craft (alchemy) check (DC 15 + spell level) while mixing
the recipe’s ingredients in a cauldron. (The cost of these
ingredients is negligible, and they are assumed to be readily
available in a spell component pouch.) If the check succeeds,
the spell is augmented with the recipe’s metamagic feat. This
doesn’t change the spell slot of the augmented spell. On a
failed check, that spell can’t be augmented that day, but the
caster can attempt to augment another spell.

A spellcaster can prepare only a single augmented spell each
time she prepares spells, and apply only one augmentation
from the cookbook to any given spell, but can combine an
augmentation with metamagic feats she possesses. In this
case, only the feats possessed by the caster adjust the spell slot
of the spell being cast. The book doesn’t confer the associated
metamagic feat on the owner, only the ability to use the given
feat when spells are prepared.
