Description

This fibrous powder is ground from bark harvested from the roots of trees growing across planar boundaries. When thrown in the air as part of casting a conjuration (summoning) spell, it grants the creatures summoned the advanced simple template. If the caster also expends one use of mythic power, the summoned creatures gain DR 5/epic, or DR 10/epic if they have at least 11 HD. Lesser root affects conjuration (summoning) spells up to 3rd level, normal root conjuration (summoning) spells up to 6th level, and greater root any conjuration (summoning) spell.
