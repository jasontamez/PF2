Description

The surface of this silver medallion is covered in angular
geometric shapes that refract light randomly. The
medallion grants a continuous +2 resistance bonus on
saves versus mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities, and
supernatural abilities. If the wearer fails a save to avoid
becoming dominated or confused, the amulet immediately
grants the wearer a second saving throw to resist the
effect. If this second save is successful, the medallion's
power fades away entirely and it becomes a simple piece
of silver jewelry.
