Description

This conical iron jingasa, or war hat, grants the wearer a
+1 deflection bonus to AC. When struck by a critical
hit or sneak attack, the wearer can spend an immediate
action to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (similar to
the fortification armor special ability, but without requiring a
roll). The damage is instead rolled normally.
This ability functions only once, though the jingasa continues to grant its deflection bonus even after the other ability is expended.
