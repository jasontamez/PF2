Description

This belt grants its wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength,
and the ability to ignore difficult terrain while charging or
making an overrun, bull rush, or trample attempt. Furthermore,
once per day on command, its wearer can spew a 60-foot cone
of poisonous green gas as a breath weapon. Any creature caught
in the area of the gas can attempt a DC 18 saving throw to resist
its effect, but if the creature fails the saving throw, it is paralyzed
for 1d4 rounds. At the end of its turn, a creature petrified by this
breath weapon can attempt a new save to end the paralysis
effect. Treat the enhancement bonus to Strength as a temporary
ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn.
