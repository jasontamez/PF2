Description

A kapre's 2-foot-long cigar never goes out. It burns with a glow that sheds light like a candle, but does not burn other organic material. Smoking the cigar is dangerous for any but a kapre-and not just because of its size. Only a Medium or larger creature can attempt to smoke the cigar. Creatures doing so must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour. Each time a creature attempts to inhale, he or she must make another save, but receives a cumulative +1 bonus for each successful inhalation in the past 24 hours.

Once inhaled, the smoke can be exhanled to the detriment of nearby foes. The smoking creature must exhale within 1 round of inhaling or be nauseated for 1 round, coughing up the potent smoke into its own square. A Medium creature can blow the smoke as a standard action at one adjacent enemy. A Large or larger creature can blow the smoke in a 15-foot cone, also as a standard action. Creatures caught in the smoky cloud must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round.
