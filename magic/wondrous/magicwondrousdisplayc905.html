Description

This human skull covered in red lacquer bears a holy symbol of Pharasma. The area around the Ruby Skull of Chast is treated as though a hallow spell had been cast upon it, with the skull as the point of origin. Creatures that are lawful neutral or worship Pharasma gain the benefit of death ward while in the area of this effect. Despite its powerful effect, the Ruby Skull of Chast does not register to detect good, detect magic, or similar divination spells unless the caster of the divination succeeds at a DC 20 caster level check.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, hallow, nondetection; Cost 32,500 gp
