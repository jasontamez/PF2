Description

This jagged, egg-shaped stone emits a faint red glow when not in direct sunlight. By rubbing a scavenger's stone against a damaged (but not destroyed) construct or object as a full-round action, you repair 1d6 points of damage to the object or construct. If this brings a broken object's hit points above half its maximum hit points, it loses the broken condition. As a standard action, you can smash a scavenger's stone against a destroyed object or damaged construct. Doing so immediately repairs the object to full functionality or heals a damaged construct of 10d6 points of damage. Destroyed magic items can be repaired in this manner if their caster level is no higher than 3rd-more powerful destroyed magical items cannot be repaired by a scavenger's stone. A newly-created scavenger's stone has 50 charges'smashing a stone against an object uses up 10 charges.
