Description

Once worn, these snug gloves seem
to meld with the hands, becoming
almost invisible to casual observation.
Twice per day, the wearer can act as
if he had the Snatch Arrows feat, even
if he does not meet the prerequisites
for the feat. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to
be effective, and at least one hand must be free to take
advantage of the magic.
