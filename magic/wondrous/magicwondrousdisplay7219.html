Description

This narrow cloth flag is made to attach to the end a knight's
lance, though it can be flown from a spear, polearm, or
even a staff. It has no effect if not mounted appropriately. A
knight's pennon grants different benefits depending on its
color and design.

Battle: The red knight's pennon of battle allows its bearer to
benefit from heroism once per day.
Honor: The gold knight's pennon of honor bestows protection
from evil upon the bearer once per day.
Parley: The white knight's pennon of parley, when displayed
approaching a negotiation, grants the bearer a +4 enhancement
bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks
for 1 hour, so long as the bearer does not initiate any hostile
action.
