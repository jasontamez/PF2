Description

A stormlure is usually fashioned from pieces of creatures
known for their affinity to air-the feathers of birds, the
shells of flying insects, and the scales of a dragon. When
activated, stormlures call to the wind, causing a tempestuous
gale. Once per day on command, the wearer of a stormlure is
surrounding by swirling winds for 1 minute, granting a 50%
miss chance against all ranged attacks, including rays and
other ranged spells that require a roll to hit. This wind does
not hinder the wearer of the stormlure in any way. At any
one time during this duration, as a swift action, the wearer
can cause the air around her to fill with crackling lightning,
dealing 4d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures
adjacent to her. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage.
