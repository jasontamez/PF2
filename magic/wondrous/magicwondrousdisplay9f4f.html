Description

Kinsight goggles are in fact two separate crystal monocles,
linked together with a simple silver clasp that allows them
to both be worn at once like pince-nez spectacles. The left
and right halves may be separated and worn individually,
allowing two people to see through one another's eyes.
When separated, the wearer of either half of the goggles
may speak a command word to see through the lens of
the other half, so long as the halves of the goggles remain
within 500 feet of one another. When the two lenses are
attached and worn as one item, they offer no magical
benefit-just some minor magnification.
