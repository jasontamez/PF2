Description

This fragrant mead is made from the purest honey gathered from sunny meadows, mixed with rare herbs in the moonlight, and fermented in earthen jars. Consuming nectar of the gods is a standard action that restores 1d4+1 uses of mythic power to a mythic creature (up to the creature's maximum). If a non-mythic creature consumes this drink, it works like the heroism spell, lasting for 1 day. A jar contains only a single draft of this potent beverage.
