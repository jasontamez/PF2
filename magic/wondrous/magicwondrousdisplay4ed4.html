Description

This simple-looking amulet bears the symbol of a group or cult and resembles the jewelry its members normally wear. When the bearer presents the necklace to a current or prospective group member (humanoids only), the recipient is compelled to accept and don the periapt unless he succeeds at a DC 11 Will save. Thereafter, the wearer is deeply devoted to the person who gave him the periapt, as though affected by a charm person spell (with no additional saving throw against the effect). He always views the giver's words and actions favorably and speaks highly of her whenever the occasion arises.
