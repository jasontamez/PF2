Description

As a swift action, the wearer of these rough leather gauntlets
can expand her hands to twice normal size and harden to the
consistency of hardwood. This transformation lasts for up to 20
rounds per day, though they need not be consecutive rounds. If
the wearer hits with an unarmed strike or natural attack using
her enlarged hands, she may attempt to bull rush her opponent
as a free action.
