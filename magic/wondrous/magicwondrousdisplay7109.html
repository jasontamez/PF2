Description

This sleeveless cotton tabard has a large but innocuous image such as a checkered field or mailed fist emblazoned on its front panel. As a swift action, a wearer devoted to a particular deity or religion can transform the image into her faith's holy symbol or transform the holy symbol back to the innocuous image. The wearer can use the holy symbol image as an actual holy symbol while it is displayed.

Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can cause a false flag tabard to flare with protective energy. All worshipers of the wearer's deity within a 60-foot-radius burst (including the wearer) gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC and CMD for 5 minutes. If the wearer is evil, this is a profane bonus rather than a sacred bonus.
