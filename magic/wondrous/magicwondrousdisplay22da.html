Description

Sacred or profane mantras cover the outer face of this
cylindrical wooden block, which rotates around a
decorative brass spindle. By holding the spindle in one hand
while meditating or resting to regain ki, the bearer may attune
his ki points to the wheel. Once attuned, the bearer's ki strikes
count as good (if the wheel has sacred mantras) or evil (if the
wheel has profane mantras) instead of lawful for the purpose
of overcoming damage reduction. This lasts until the next time
the bearer rests or meditates to regain ki points. A creature
can only be attuned to one prayer wheel at a time, and a
prayer wheel can only be attuned to one person at a time.
Only creatures who can make lawfully-aligned ki strikes can
use a prayer wheel.
