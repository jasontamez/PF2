This large, furry hat is sewn from the thick pelt of an animal native to the frozen north, and has earflaps that can be pulled down or folded up over the crown of the hat. When worn, an ushanka of the northlands grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against cold effects and a +5 competence bonus on Survival checks. When the earflaps are pulled down, the wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against sonic effects, but also takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks made to hear. Pulling the earflaps down is a move action.
