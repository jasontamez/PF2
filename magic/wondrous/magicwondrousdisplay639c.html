Description

This small decorative object can take almost any form but is always small and seemingly valuable. The item seems so intriguing and delightful that any creature holding it-including while examining it with Appraise or Spellcraft checks-becomes infatuated with the object and compelled to keep it (Will DC 13 negates).

Each talisman of spying is linked to a ring when created. Any creature within 30 feet of a talisman of spying takes a -5 penalty on saving throws against divinations used by the ring's wearer. The ring's wearer is always aware of the direction and distance to the talisman and can discern the general condition of a creature carrying the talisman as if using status. Once per day, the creature wearing the talisman's ring can use scry upon the talisman. This functions as scrying if the talisman is carried by a creature, or as clairaudience/clairvoyance if the talisman is unattended.
