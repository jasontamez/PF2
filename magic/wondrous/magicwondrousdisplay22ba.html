Description

This tiny glass bead transforms itself into a 10-foot-by-10- foot pile of logs and kindling whenever its command word is spoken. A sturdy, 8-foot-tall post juts out of the center of the log heap. This heap does not light upon coming into being, but anyone who touches the heap and says a second command word causes it to burst into flame (this also automatically activates any pyre salt in the flame's area). The fire burns for 4 hours or until extinguished, at which point it turns back into a bead. The owner of the item must wait twice as long as the fire burned before she can order the bead to become a pile of logs again.
