Description

This simple mat is woven from a type of reed that grows in the swamps of Geryon's realm. Meditating on the mat opens the user's mind to the destructive power of emptiness. If a lawful evil character with a ki pool meditates upon an asura meditation mat for 1 hour, for the next 4 hours, the user's mind becomes an empty vessel guided by wrath. During this time, the user gains a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects but must attempt saving throws against all mind-affecting effects (including beneficial or harmless ones). In addition, before the user makes a melee attack with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon, she can spend up to 4 ki points to declare an empty strike. The user gains a profane bonus on the attack roll and weapon damage roll equal to twice the number of ki points spent, and the attack ignores 2 points of hardness or damage reduction for each ki point spent. When used with Stunning Fist or similar feats, an empty strike also increases the DC of that effect by the number of ki points spent. A user without a ki pool, or one who is not lawful evil, gains no benefit from an asura meditation mat.
