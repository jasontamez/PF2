Description

Reflections visible in this palm-sized hand mirror always seem
ghostly and insubstantial. When a creature holding the mirror
is targeted by an attack, he can spend an immediate action to
summon his reflection from the glass to interpose itself between
him and the blow. The reflection functions as an image produced
by the spell mirror image. If the image is struck by the attack, it
shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the
image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll
or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result. If
the attack does not strike the image, the image fades away at
the start of the mirror bearer's next turn. The mirror can be used
three times per day.
