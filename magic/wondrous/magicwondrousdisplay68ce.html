Description

Tireless wayfinders have burnished copper cases and silver inner workings. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), the bearer of a tireless wayfinder halves the Strength and Dexterity penalties for being fatigued or exhausted, and gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made against effects that cause fatigue or exhaustion. The tireless wayfinder must be in a creature's possession for 1 full week before these benefits apply, and they are lost if it leaves the creature's possession for more than 1 hour.
