Description

Each end of this heavy copper neckwear bears the image of a
snarling lion. The wearer gains a +2 morale bonus on saving
throws against fear. If the wearer is a barbarian of at least
12th level, she gains fearless rage as a bonus rage power. If
she already has this power, she also becomes immune to the
panicked condition while raging, and any panic-causing attack
against her while she rages instead causes her to regain 1
round of rage up to once per round.
