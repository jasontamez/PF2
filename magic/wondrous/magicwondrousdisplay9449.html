Description

In outer construction and manner of play, pipes of shifting tempo resemble a typical set of unremarkable pan pipes, but the complex chambers within the pipes are modeled after difficult-to-duplicate Azlanti instruments. Music created by these pipes sounds unusually mournful, with a strange, almost warbling subtext to the notes. Up to three times per day, a user can attempt to harness these pipes' power by making a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check as a standard action. With a successful check, the possessor can play a grave melody to cast slow or an allegro melody to cast haste. The resulting spell functions as normal for the item's caster level, affecting five creatures per casting.
