Description

An aegis of recovery grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus
on all saving throws made to recover from a continuing
effect, such as ongoing poison damage, daily saving throws
against a disease, a hold person spell, or lingering damage
from an attack. This bonus does not help against initial saving
throws against such effects. Should the wearer ever drop
below 0 hit points, the aegis heals the wearer for 2d8+3
points of damage and then crumbles to dust.
