Description

This black band of silk grants its wearer spectacular senses
within a limited range. Some believe these items were made
to grant lesser swordmasters the illusion of skill. When the
wearer places the blindfold over her eyes, she becomes
blinded, but gains blindsight (Bestiary 298) within the reach
of her melee weapon, or 5 feet if the wearer is not wielding
a melee weapon. Furthermore, the wearer is under the effect
of a constant locate weakness (Ultimate Combat 236) spell,
but only when making melee attacks.
