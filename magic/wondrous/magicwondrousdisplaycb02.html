Description

Embroidered images of cherry blossoms and cranes in flight
adorn this blue silk kimono. The wearer can move and
reposition these images on the kimono at will. The kimono
grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws
and a +4 bonus on all caster level checks.


Once per day, the wearer can capture a single creature within
60 feet within the kimono (no save), shunting the victim into
an extradimensional space similar to that created by a maze
spell. Inside this otherworldly prison, the maze appears as an
endless cherry orchard filled with "walls" of windblown cherry
blossoms and cranes flying overhead. Each round on its turn,
the victim inside the kimono may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence
check to escape the kimono as a full-round action. If the victim
doesn’t escape, it is released after 10 minutes, returning to
where it had been before the kimono drew it in. If this location
is occupied by another creature or a solid object, the subject
appears in the nearest open space.


Whenever a creature is drawn inside the kimono, the victim’s
image temporarily manifests as another embroidered design
among the kimono’s other images. While a victim is trapped
inside, the kimono’s bonuses on saving throws and caster
level checks are increased by 2 (to +6). The kimono’s increased
bonuses return to normal when the victim is freed or released.
