Description

Infused with the power of Hell's courts, this blood-quenched steel gavel emits an ear-splitting din when struck against a hard surface. Once per day, as a standard action, you can use it to judge a single foe within 30 feet, who then suffers the effect of a dictum spell.

The gavel bestows one negative level on any chaotic or good creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. If the creature is chaotic good, these negative levels stack.
