Description

This grand-looking wooden harp is carved with images of
various venomous creatures. Once per day the bearer may
play the harp to target a single opponent with a poison spell
(DC 16). Alternatively, the bearer may play the harp to grant allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws
against disease and poison; maintaining this benefit each
round is a standard action. If the player has the countersong
bardic performance ability, he may expend rounds of bardic
performance to use the harp to refocus his countersong
against disease and poison instead of sonic or language-dependent
effects.
