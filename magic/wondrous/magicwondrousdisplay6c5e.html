Description

This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and
magical location just as a nondetection spell does. If a
divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster
of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20
+ caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the wearer had cast
nondetection on herself).
