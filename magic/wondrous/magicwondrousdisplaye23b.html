Description

This normal-appearing garment is
attuned to one of three types of
alignment. It can be white (01-45 on
d%, good alignment), gray (46-75,
neither good nor evil alignment), or
black (76-100, evil alignment). To most
wearers, the robe offers no powers
or has no effects unless the wearer's
alignment doesn't match that of the
robe (see below). Only an arcane spellcaster can fully realize
this potent magic item's powers once the robe is donned.
These powers are as follows.
<ul><li>+5 armor bonus to AC
</li><li>Spell resistance 18
</li><li>+4 resistance bonus on all saving throws
</li><li>+2 enhancement bonus on caster level checks made to
overcome spell resistance</li></ul>
If a white robe is donned by an evil character, she
immediately gains three permanent negative levels. The
same is true with respect to a black robe donned by a good
character. An evil or good character who puts on a gray
robe, or a neutral character who dons either a white or black
robe, gains two permanent negative levels. These negative
levels remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be
overcome in any way (including through restoration spells).
Negative levels are immediately removed if the robe is
removed from the wearer.
