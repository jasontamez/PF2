Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This pair of leather bracers is marked by runes of bondage from ancient days. Each rune is deliberately incomplete, in order to invert its intended function. Once per day, when a Shoanti wearer becomes possessed by magic jar, possession (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 180), or a similar effect, the bracers automatically expel the possessing creature. The possessing creature does not have a chance to take any actions (such as removing the bracers) before this occurs.
