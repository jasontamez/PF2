Description

These leather boots bear a knife
motif worked into their durable blue
leather. Three times per day, the
wearer can speak a command word
as a swift action, causing a serrated
knife to fly from the boots and instantly slice through any
nonmagical bond currently restraining the wearer. The
knife conjured from bondbreaker's boots can cut through
brambles, ropes, tanglefoot bags, vines, webs, or any other
similar nonmagical item restraining the wearer, but cannot
help when the owner is actively restrained by a creature.
Bondbreaker's boots also cannot free the wearer if manacles
or chains restrain her.
