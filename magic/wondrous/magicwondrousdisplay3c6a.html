Description

This hide helm is set with plates of ivory carved with primitive runes, with a pair of tusks curving down on either side of the wearer's face for cheek guards. The tusks of the helm provide a gore attack dealing 1d6 points of damage for a Medium wearer (or 1d4 points of damage for a Small wearer) and count as a magic weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

The helm of the Mammoth Lord also protects the wearer from cold environments as the endure elements spell. Furthermore, it provides a +5 competence bonus on Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks with elephants, mammoths, mastodons, and other elephant-like creatures.

On command, the wearer may use detect animals or plants or speak with animals, but only to detect or communicate with elephant-like creatures. This helm originally appeared in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment.
