Description

This leather pouch is usually decorated with a druidic motif.
Within is an extradimensional space that can hold 4 cubic
feet or 40 pounds worth of items and otherwise functions as
a small bag of holding. If the bearer uses a polymorph effect
or wild shape to transform into an animal, dragon, elemental,
magical beast, plant, or vermin, the pouch never merges with
her body. It automatically relocates to an easily-accessible
place on her body (such as on a belt or a cord around her neck),
allowing her to access the pouch and items within it while she
is transformed.
