Description

This simple white cotton headband
is decorated with a stylized imperial
dragon coiled above the wearer's
forehead. The headband grants the
wearer a +2 enhancement bonus
to her Wisdom score. Treat this as
a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband
is worn.


Whenever the wearer suffers a fear effect, she may spend
an immediate action to reduce the severity of the fear effect
by one step. If the wearer would become panicked, she is
instead frightened. If she would become frightened, she is
instead shaken. If the wearer would become shaken, the
effect is negated entirely. The wearer can use this ability up
to three times per day.
