Description

The wearer of these boots is able to
travel across snow at her normal speed,
leaving no tracks. Additionally, the boots
enable her to travel at normal speed
across the slipperiest ice (horizontal
surfaces only, not vertical or sharply
slanted ones) without falling or slipping.
Finally, boots of the winterlands warm the wearer, as if she
were affected by an endure elements spell.
