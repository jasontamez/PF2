Description

These elegant, dark purple robes are
usually decorated with gold stitching
suggesting a particular sorcerer bloodline,
though some might indicate a family tree.
When a sorcerer dons a robe of arcane
heritage, the stitching pulls itself apart
and reweaves to match her particular
sorcerer bloodline. The wearer treats her
sorcerer level as 4 higher than normal
for the purpose of determining what
bloodline powers she can use and their effects.
