Description

When you take a full-round action to mold this perpetually moist lump of clay into an animal, it flashes to life and grows to full size, attacking your enemies or following your commands if you have the means to communicate with animals. After 9 rounds the animal reverts to nonmagical clay. You may use the clay to create any sort of creature that summon nature's ally I, II, III, IV, or V can summon. There is enough clay to create up to five spell levels of creatures. For example, you could expend 3 spell levels of clay to create a lion (from the summon nature's ally III list) and still have 2 spell levels left over. Each use of the clay produces only one creature.
