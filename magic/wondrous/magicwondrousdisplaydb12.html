Description

This stone grants you a single use of the
augury spell with a 100% success rate. The
stone must have been orbiting your head for
at least 24 hours before it can be activated in
such a way, which you can do with a thought
as a free action. The stone instantly returns an
answer of "weal," "woe," "weal and woe," or "nothing." After
being used in this manner, the stone loses all magical power
and becomes a dull gray ioun stone.
