Description

The acid in this flask burns not through matter, but through space itself, creating a temporary extradimensional pit wherever it touches. A flask of dimensional acid can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Alternatively, it can be used as a special component when casting the snare spell. Instead of the spell's usual effect, the creature that triggers the modified snare is treated as if it had taken a direct hit from the dimensional acid.

Dimensional acid comes in a number of varieties.

Basic Pit: This acid creates a pit, as the create pit spell, where it lands. Faint conjuration; CL 3rd; Craft Wondrous Item, create pit.
Corrosive Pit: This acid affects matter as well, creating an acid pit where it lands. Faint conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, acid pit.
Jagged Pit: This acid creates a spiked pit spell where it lands. Moderate conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, spiked pit.
Living Pit: This acid burns into a living dimension, creating a hungry pit where it lands. Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, hungry pit.
