Description

Handles of polished bone and grim skulls decorate this ornately carved ship's wheel. When grasped, the wheel's handles feel comfortably smooth. Those who stand watch at the wheel claim to hear the whispered guidance of Captain Xiribal Jalhazar, and occasionally feel ghostly hands holding the ship's course true. When fitted to the helm of a ship, Jalhazar's wheel grants a +5 competence bonus on sailing checks to turn the ship with the hard to port or hard to starboard actions (Skull & Shackles Player's Guide 13). The wheel also halves the penalty on sailing checks made when turning the ship while traveling at three or more times the ship's acceleration. In addition, the ship's pilot can combine a hard to port or hard to starboard action with a full ahead or heave to action as a full-round action up to three times per day.
