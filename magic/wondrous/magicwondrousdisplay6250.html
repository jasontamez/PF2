Description

This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a portable
hole. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another
world-a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane
(chosen randomly). If the well is moved, it opens to a new
plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded,
or rolled, just as a portable hole can be. Objects from the world
the well touches can come through the opening just as easily-
it is a two-way portal.
