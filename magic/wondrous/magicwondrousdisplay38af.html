Description

This coarse hempen robe seems made from a single strand of
twine. The wearer can draw up to 30 feet of twine or up to 10
feet of hemp rope per round from the robe without harming
it. As an immediate action, the wearer can draw up to 150
feet of twine or 50 feet of rope from the robe, but this gives
the robe the broken condition and suppresses its powers until
it is repaired. Twine or rope drawn from the robe remains
connected until cut or torn, but is treated as common material
rather than part of a magic item. Pieces removed become
normal twine or rope.
