Description

A security belt increases the DC of Sleight of Hand checks made
against the wearer and checks to locate items or weapons
hidden on the wearer's person by 5. The wearer also gets a
+5 bonus to CMD against the steal maneuver. Once per day on
command, the wearer can touch a single item of up to 10 cubic
feet and shrink it into a tiny cloth duplicate as the shrink item
spell. With a move action, the wearer can draw one of these
items from one of the belt's pockets and return it to normal size.
It is difficult to detect a security belt and any items in the pockets
as magic. They are affected as though a constant magic aura
spell were making them appear nonmagical.
