Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This elaborate silver diadem features stylized antennae similar to those of a lashunta. While worn, it maintains a constant planetary adaptation (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds 55) upon a wearer. The diadem's magic also enhances a lashunta wearer's telepathy, allowing her to mentally communicate with any creature that has a language, rather than only creatures that share a language with her.
