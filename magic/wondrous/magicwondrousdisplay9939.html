Description

This small harp is carved from whale ivory, and its frame is filigreed with delicate gold patterns depicting winds and clouds. Up to three times per day as a standard action, you can use a harp of storms to surround yourself with an aura of brisk wind that grants you a 20% miss chance against all ranged attacks. This wind cloak effect lasts for 1 minute. At any time during that minute, you may strike additional notes on the harp of storms in order to produce one of the following three effects. <ul><li>Air Walk: You cause the winds to lift you off the ground, granting you the effects of an air walk spell for 1 round. This is normally a move action, but if you succeed at a DC 15 Perform (strings) check, it is a swift action.</li><li>Gust of Wind: You can direct the winds surrounding you to duplicate the effects of a gust of wind spell. This is a standard action.</li><li>Lightning Strike: As a standard action, make a Perform (strings) check. You cause a bolt of lightning to strike a single foe within 30 feet, dealing an amount of electricity damage equal to the result of your Perform (strings) check. The target gets a DC 15 Reflex save to halve the damage caused by this lightning strike.</li></ul>
