These calf-high leather boots are inscribed with Cayden Cailean's holy symbol. The wearer can stand up from prone without provoking attacks of opportunity and gains a +4 bonus to CMD against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can move up to 30 feet; this movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
