Description

This black scabbard is engraved with intricate
silver runes that depict all manner of bladed
weapons. A scabbard of keen edges can
shrink or enlarge to accommodate any knife,
dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and
including a greatsword. Up to three times
per day on command, the scabbard casts
keen edge on any blade placed within it.
Runes similar to those on the outside of the
scabbard appear on a blade while it is under
this keen edge effect.
