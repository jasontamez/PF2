Description

This set of magical paints comes in a set of three small clay pots, each containing a different color - blue, yellow, and red. You may use the sorcerous pigments to store spells in a painting and set a specific condition that triggers the spells. You must succeed at a Craft (painting) check (DC 10 + spell level) in order to successfully store each spell. On a failed check, the spell and the sorcerous pigments that would have been used are wasted. A set of sorcerous pigments can be used to "paint" up to 12 levels of spells.
