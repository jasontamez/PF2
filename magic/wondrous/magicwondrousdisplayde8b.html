Description

This gold amulet is fashioned in the shape of a winged scarab beetle holding a large ruby that represents the solar disk. The scarab grants its wearer a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects, and enables its wearer to detect any mummy within 60 feet, although he must concentrate as a standard action to use this ability. In addition, anytime the wearer would be affected by a curse or disease effect, the scarab of mummy defense can absorb the effect with no harm to the wearer. Upon absorbing 12 such effects, the scarab turns to dust and is destroyed. An effect that's both a curse and a disease, such as mummy rot, is considered a single effect for these purposes.
