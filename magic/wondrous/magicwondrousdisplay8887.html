Description

This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4
feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional
space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions.
Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed
amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of
the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on
the table below.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Bag</td><td>Bag Weight</td><td>Contents Limit</td><td>Contents Volume Limit</td><td>Price</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type I</td><td>15 lbs.</td><td>250 lbs.</td><td>30 cubic ft.</td><td>2,500 gp</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type II</td><td>25 lbs.</td><td>500 lbs.</td><td>70 cubic ft.</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type III</td><td>35 lbs.</td><td>1,000 lbs.</td><td>150 cubic ft.</td><td>7,400 gp</td></tr>
<tr><td>Type IV</td><td>60 lbs.</td><td>1,500 lbs.</td><td>250 cubic ft.</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr></table>
If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce
it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and
is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding
is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but
the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living
creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10
minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific
item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag
contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold,in which
case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to
the character carrying the bag.

If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the
Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked
into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a
bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the
bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there,
destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.
