Description

This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance
of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow
highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of
three sorts.


One command word causes the gem to shed light as a
hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any
charges, and it continues to emit light until this command
word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.


Another command word causes the gem of brightness to
send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This
strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by
this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14
Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.


The third command word causes the gem to flare in a
blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this
glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must
make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.
This use expends 5 charges.


A newly created gem of brightness has 50 charges. When
all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical
and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.
