Description

This winged, golden cartouche hangs on a leather thong beaded with semiprecious stones. Normally, a cartouche of distinctive warding functions as a ring of protection +1 and allows the wearer to use shield two times per day. Once per day, the wearer can write the name of a specific individual in Ancient Osiriani hieroglyphs on the cartouche (the name must be the person's true name, not an alias, nickname, or title). This causes the cartouche's regular powers to go dormant, but for the next hour the wearer is protected against the inscribed individual in three ways: <ul><li>The wearer gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC against all attacks made by the inscribed individual (including physical attacks, and magic items and spells that require attack rolls).</li><li>The wearer gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and effects cast or created by the inscribed individual.</li><li>The wearer gains a +2 bonus on opposed skill checks against the inscribed individual.</li></ul> At the end of 1 hour, the inscribed name fades, and the cartouche loses all its powers for 23 hours. Note that the actions of the inscribed individual's allies (including minions or summoned creatures) are not subject to the cartouche's power.
