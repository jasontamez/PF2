Description

These stylized wooden masks are carved to resemble a common type of wasteland vermin, such as a giant ant, scorpion, or spider. While using wild shape or a vermin shape spell to assume the form of a vermin that corresponds with the mask's design, the wearer gains the following benefits. First, the wearer can speak normally despite the limitations of the form's anatomy. Furthermore, the effect of the wearer's wild shape ability (if any) lasts for 3 additional hours, and when the wearer is under the effects of a vermin shape spell, the spell lasts for 7 additional minutes.
