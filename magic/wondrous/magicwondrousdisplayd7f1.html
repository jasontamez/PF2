Description

This rug is able to fly through the air
as if affected by an overland flight
spell of unlimited duration. The size,
carrying capacity, and speed of the
different carpets of flying are shown
on the table below. Beautifully and
intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to
activate it-if the device is within voice range, the command
word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The
carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Size</td><td>Capacity</td><td>Speed</td><td>Weight</td><td>Price</td></tr>
<tr><td>5-ft.-by-5-ft.</td><td>200 lbs.</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>8 lbs.</td><td>20,000 gp</td></tr>
<tr><td>5-ft.-by-10-ft.</td><td>400 lbs.</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>10 lbs.</td><td>35,000 gp</td></tr>
<tr><td>10-ft.-by-10-ft.</td><td>800 lbs.</td><td>40 ft.</td><td>15 lbs.</td><td>60,000 gp</td></tr></table>
A carpet of flying can carry up to double its capacity, but
doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. A carpet of flying can
hover without making a Fly skill check and gives a +5 bonus
to other Fly checks.
