Description

Cast in the image of the sun and often
ornamented with an open eye, this
amulet defends the wearer against
the need for sleep. The wearer of this
amulet does not need to sleep, but
must remain at ease for the normal
amount of time to regain spells and
other abilities that require rest (although the wearer could
perform light activity, such as reading or keeping watch). Once the wearer has used the power of this amulet for a
total of seven nights, the amulet loses its power for one
day and the wearer is exhausted for this duration. If the
wearer removes the amulet for any reason after having
used its ability, she becomes exhausted for four hours for
every night of sleep skipped.
