Description

This aegis has a thick medallion that is typically carved with the image of bared fangs or a poisoned dagger. It functions as an aegis of recovery, except it grants the wearer a +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws to recover from a continuing effect, such as ongoing poison damage, daily saving throws against a disease, a hold person spell, or lingering damage from an attack. Should the wearer drop below 0 hit points, the greater aegis of recovery heals the wearer for 5d8+7 points of damage and then crumbles to dust.
