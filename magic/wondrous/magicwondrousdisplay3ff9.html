Description

This item appears to be a normal cloak, with a pattern very
similar to a major cloak of displacement nocturnal designs,
but when worn its magical properties distort and warp light
waves. This displacement works similar to the blur spell,
granting a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It
functions continually.
