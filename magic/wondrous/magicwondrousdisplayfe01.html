Description

The cloak of moral refraction has long been a tool of the riftwardens' mystics who charge themselves with maintaining cosmic balance and closing extraplanar portals throughout the multiverse. The shimmering fabric of this light silver-and-red cloak never dirties or wrinkles, and when laid out flat, the cloak reflects light nearly as well as a mirror.

A fully charged cloak of moral refraction has 3 charges' charges used are automatically renewed at a rate of 1 charge per day at dawn. The wearer may use the cloak to expend these charges and create the following effects. <ul><li>1 charge: Dispel an ongoing spell with an alignment descriptor, as the third function of dispel chaos/evil/good/law.</li><li>2 charges: Ready an action to counter a spell or spell-like ability with an alignment descriptor. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. The charges are expended only after countering a spell or spell-like ability. If you ready this action but it is not triggered, the charges are not expended.</li><li>3 charges: As an immediate action, counter a spell or spell-like ability cast by an outsider with an alignment subtype. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. In addition, the outsider must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be banished back to its home plane, as banishment. An outsider with more than 26 Hit Dice is unaffected by the banishment effect.</li></ul>
