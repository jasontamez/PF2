Description

This bracelet is adorned with seven coral beads carved
in intricate designs. When a critical hit or sneak attack is
confirmed on the wearer, as an immediate action before
damage is rolled, he can choose to convert the critical hit
into a normal hit. Each time the wearer negates a critical hit
or sneak attack in this manner, one bead shatters. When all
seven are used up, the bracelet itself crumbles into powder.
