Description

These fine silk wrappings-covered in mystic symbols and diagrams of the wearer's pressure points-wind around the wearer's hands and wrists. When the wearer spends ki to make an additional attack, he can spend 1 additional point of ki to use the Stunning Fist feat with the attack, even if he has already used the feat that round.

If the wearer is a monk using an archetype that replaces Stunning Fist with a different feat that's usable a number times per day equal to his monk level, hand wraps of blinding ki allow that feat to be used a second time instead of allowing him to use Stunning Fist.
