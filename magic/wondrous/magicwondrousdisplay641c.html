Description

These horseshoes are made of blackened steel and are
typically stamped with infernal symbols or, less subtly, horrific
images of terrified and tortured steeds of the darkest hues.
They typically give off a slight smell of brimstone, as though
they had been crafted in some hellish forge. On command, the mount's rider may grant it the smoke
supernatural ability (Bestiary 216).
The horseshoes can be used for 10 rounds per day, split up as
the mount's rider chooses (minimum 1 round per use). While
this power is activated, the mount's eyes, hooves, mane, and
tail burst into flame, and its hooves deal an extra 1d4 points
of fire damage.
