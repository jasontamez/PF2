Description

This harrow mat allows a harrower to tap into the ancestral knowledge of nearby spirits. If a harrower uses this mat as an additional focus component while casting harrowing or greater harrowing, she treats her caster level as 1 higher. When this mat is used to perform a harrowing (magical or not) over a grave or other burial site, the spirit of the interned body influences the harrowing; for each card drawn related to the past, the harrower can draw from the deck twice and choose which card to place.
