Description

This tall, blue candle is shot through with swirls of an amber color and puts off a pleasant fragrance similar to honeysuckle when lit. Any creature within 10 feet of the candle gains a +5 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks, while at the same time taking a -5 penalty on Bluff and Intimidate checks. These bonuses and penalties apply only on checks against other creatures within the candle's influence. It is a favorite for use during negotiations and parleys. The candle can burn for a total of 8 hours. These hours don't need to be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-hour increments. Once all 8 hours are used, the candle is destroyed.
