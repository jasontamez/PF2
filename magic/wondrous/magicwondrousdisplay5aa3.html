Description

Three times per day on command, the phylactery's wearer
can determine the current health and overall well-being of
any one ally within 30 feet. This effect acts as the status
spell. If the wearer has the ability to channel energy or lay on
hands, he can as a swift action choose to apply the effects of
that class feature to an ally he is currently evaluating so long
as that ally is within 30 feet of him, but doing so ends the
effect of the phylactery's status.
