Description

Absorbent fibers line this heavy
canvas coat. Once per day as a
standard action, the wearer can pour
a potion onto this lining, suffusing
it into the coat. If the potion has an
instantaneous duration, the wearer
can activate the coat as a swift action
to consume the potion. If the potion's
duration is measured in rounds, the wearer can activate the
coat as a swift action to gain the potion's benefits for 1 round,
repeating as desired each round until the potion's entire duration
has been used. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. The
coat absorbs only potions with instantaneous or round-based
durations, and only those which affect creatures (for example, it
does not work on oils). Once the coat absorbs a potion, the potion
cannot be retrieved from it, only used as described above. The
absorbed potion loses its powers after 24 hours, even if unused.
