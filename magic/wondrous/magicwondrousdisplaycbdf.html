Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This quilted silk cloak is trimmed with thick white feathers. As a move action once per day, the wearer can whirl the cloak about himself to activate a fire shield effect. It activates as a warm shield if the ambient temperature is 65 degrees Fahrenheit or colder, or as a chill shield if the ambient temperature is 66 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter.

If the wearer is a Triaxian, he gains energy resistance for as long as he wears the cloak. If he's summerborn, he gains fire resistance 10. If he's winterborn, he gains cold resistance 10. If he is transitional, he gains resistance 5 to both cold and fire.
