Description

This intricate mask is made of gold-plated iron. Writhing snake
tails radiate from a gemstone upon the brow, almost as if
they were medusa-like hair. The mask grants a +4 bonus on
all saving throws against visual effects, including gaze attacks
and sight-based illusions. Once per day as a standard action,
the wearer can cause the central gemstone to glow with pale
green light, at which point she may target any one creature
within 30 feet. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC
15 Fortitude save or be petrified for 1 minute, as if by flesh to
stone.
