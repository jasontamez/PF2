Description

This talisman made of bone, claws, and beads protects its wearer from bad luck, evil spirits, and foul magic. The first time each day that the wearer fails a saving throw, the charm of fate causes the wearer to instead successfully save if the roll was missed by 5 or less. If the saving throw was missed by 6 or more, the charm's daily use is expended to no effect.
