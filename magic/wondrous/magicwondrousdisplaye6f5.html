Description

These multihued cloaks are as mutable as the proteans that inspired them. The typical protean cloak appears to be crafted from the hide of a naunet protean, but regardless of their apparent source, all protean cloaks shimmer and flicker with a riot of color. While the material feels scaly and rugose to the touch, a protean cloak flows like silk and does not hinder mobility.

A protean cloak provides a +1 to +5 resistance bonus on a single type of saving throw (typically Will saving throws). Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can change the type of saving throw that receives this bonus; the cloak then provides its bonus on the new type of saving throw until its type is changed again. If a protean cloak is unattended for more than 24 hours, the resistance bonus it applies automatically reverts back to Will saves.
