Description

This altar is a large stone hearth that is normally kept blazing and features a prominent image of Erastil wielding his sacred bow, using the holy weapon either in defense of a home or to hunt game for food. Praying at the altar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal and Heal checks, or one of the following magic weapon special abilities (worshiper's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the worshiper: animal-bane, conserving, huntsman, or merciful. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the worshiper's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the worshiper.
