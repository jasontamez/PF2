Description

This altar is a veiled box of thick steel designed to house ritual implements of torture and self-mutilation in perfect darkness. Praying at the altar grants the worshiper a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws for 1 minute whenever the worshiper takes damage or is the target of a pain effect during the next 24 hours after praying at the altar. Multiple sources of damage or pain reset this duration rather than stack.
