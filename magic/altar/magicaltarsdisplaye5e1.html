Description

Unearthed from the ashes of Oppara's former temple of Sarenrae, the restored and rededicated altar of the Dawnflower sits inside the House of Dawn's Redemption at the exact location it resided nearly 200 years ago. As a gift to welcome Sarenrae's faith back into Taldor, this reclaimed treasure symbolizes the hope for a peaceful existence between the traditionalists of Oppara and those longing for the light of the Healing Flame.

This altar consists of a tiled blue box detailed with mosaics of doves in flight. A stand for a scimitar is built on top of the altar. During important worship services, the scabbard of the Lost Kiss (see below) is often placed atop the altar's scimitar stand. Praying at the altar grants a +3 bonus on Diplomacy checks to redeem an evil creature or change the attitude of a creature opposed to the Sarenite faith. Creatures who rest or receive long-term care (with the Heal skill) within 60 feet of the altar also regain 1 additional hit point per level each day.
