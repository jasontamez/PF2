Thassilonian Runes


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/riseOfTheRunelords/v5748btpy815o">Pathfinder #5: Sins of the Saviors</a>
One of the great achievements of the Runelords of Thassilon was the creation of arcane runes empowered to infuse living flesh with magical power. With these arcane markings, the fundamentals of one's lifeforce were altered, allowing the bearer to activate various magical abilities.

Thassilonian runes resemble runic tattoos inscribed in the flesh with arcane inks and scar-inducing irritants. Their intricate forms are endless variations on the seven runes of sin magic. Any individual bearing a Thassilonian rune can make use of its abilities even if not a spellcaster or if its powers are from a school ordinarily prohibited to the bearer.

A Thassilonian rune is considered a magic item but does not take up a body slot in the usual sense. Instead, an individual is limited to possessing one rune, regardless of the creature's or the rune's actual size. The potent magics essential to these runes' function is disrupted by the addition of a second rune, preventing either from working. Once a rune is inscribed, it cannot be removed short of a miracle, wish, or a mage's disjunction cast directly on it (this use of the spell does not have the normal area of effect and can affect only one rune at a time). Even the loss of that body part is not foolproof, for if it is regenerated or otherwise recovered, it returns with the rune still upon it.

Runes are created using the Inscribe Rune feat (see sidebar). Several runes dating back to the time of ancient Thassilon are presented in the following sections, though this list is by no means exhaustive, and PCs with the proper feats and abilities could conceivably develop new ones.

Aura strong necromancy; CL 9th
Slot rune; Price 135,000 gp

Description

Designed as a foolproof means of ensuring absolute loyalty, even from those ordinarily immune to compulsion and mind-affecting magic, this rune is infused with a single specific prohibition when first inscribed. This prohibition must be stated in 10 words or fewer and the bearer must agree to it of his own free will. From then on, if the bearer breaks this prohibition, he is afflicted with searing pain, taking a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for as long as he is in violation of the prohibition and for 5 minutes thereafter. This rune affects any creature who agrees to bear it.

Aura moderate illusion; CL 6th
Slot rune; Price 36,000 gp

Description

The bearer of this rune confuses all attempts to divine information about him. This functions as a permanent misdirection spell, which the bearer can change the target of (and thus what he is detected as) at will.

In addition, whenever the rune's bearer enters an area affected by a divination (scrying) effect or anytime a creature casts a divination (scrying) spell that targets him, the scrying spell's caster must make a DC 18 Will save. If this save fails, the rune's bearer realizes that he is being scryed upon, knows what spell is in effect, and knows the name of the spell's caster.

Construction

Requirements Inscribe Rune, magic aura, misdirection; Cost 18,000 gp, 1,440 XP</td>

<td>Rune of the Lord's Palanquin

Aura strong conjuration; CL 15th
Slot rune; Price 135,000 gp

Description

Once per day, the bearer of this rune can summon a floating, semi-real palanquin. This conveyance has all the special abilities of a phantom steed and can hold the bearer and up to 150 additional pounds of weight. Other creatures can ride the palanquin as long as the total weight is less than 150 pounds. The palanquin can be dismissed at any time as a free action, but cannot be summoned again until the next day. The look of the palanquin is decided when the rune is inscribed, though it usually takes the form of a regal, comfortable-looking litter that moves without the need for bearers.
