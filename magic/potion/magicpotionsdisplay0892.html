Description

The sparrowfish is a bland-tasting swimmer native to the rivers and streams of Kyonin, notable mainly for its excellent speed and its ability to leap out of the water and onto low-hanging tree limbs to avoid predators. Its meat is the color of salmon and is reasonably tasty when prepared with butter, herbs, and salt; it is best eaten fresh, but if properly dried after cooking, it retains its flavor whether eaten cold or reheated. Eating the magical fillet gives you a +10 competence bonus on Balance, Climb, and Swim checks for 1 hour.
