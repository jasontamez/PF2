Description

Cayden Cailean's faithful keep the secret of this sweet, spiced liquor with magical properties closely guarded, but they freely offer the libation for sale. This strong beverage often comes in iridescent blue-green wine bottles, sometimes held in elegant slings made of gold or silver chains.

A dose of hero's brew mimics the effect of a potion of heroism, granting you a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for 1 hour. Additionally, the potent brew renders you moderately tipsy and impairs your judgment somewhat, imposing a -2 Wisdom penalty for its duration-a religious state for many of the god's worshipers.

A cleric of Cayden Cailean who has Charm or Strength as a chosen domain may use the domain power of either domain one additional time per day while under the effects of hero's brew. This does not count against your domain power's uses per day limit, and it immediately ends the effects of the hero's brew. You can only use hero's brew to gain one additional use of a domain power per day.
