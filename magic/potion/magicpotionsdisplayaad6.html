Description

Cheya is a smaller, immobile cousin of the assassin vine native to Kyonin (some elves believe that the aggressive mobile assassin vine plants are the result of a cheya cultivating program). Generally harmless except to tiny animals, some elves cultivate cheya for its roots, leaves, and berries. The roots are crushed into a paste and mixed with water or milk to make dough, stuffed with diced cheya leaves, then boiled or baked, often topped with sweet jelly made from cheya berries. Hearty, satisfying, and portable, the dumplings are excellent candidates for magical augmentation. A typical cheya dumpling gives you a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 1 hour, though other varieties may enhance other ability scores.
