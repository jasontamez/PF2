Description

This spongy brown cake feels light in the hand but is incredibly chewy. Consuming it strengthens your leg muscles and makes your tendons more elastic (making audible stretching and popping noises for a few seconds after ingestion), greatly improving your ability to jump and fall. For the next 10 minutes, you gain a +20 bonus on Jump checks. If you deliberately jump down from a height and succeed at a DC 15 Jump check, you take falling damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than normal (rather than 10 feet shorter). If you fall, you may make a Jump check instead of a Tumble check to treat the fall as 10 feet shorter.
