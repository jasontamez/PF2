Scaling Items - Magic Equipment









Legacy Items


Whether members of professionally acquisitive organizations such as the Pathfinder Society or simply amateur treasure hunters, adventurers dream of discovering powerful relics wielded by legendary figures from the murky past. While these might be simple artifacts or heirlooms, some rare items are infused by the mighty deeds of their former owners, and an adventurer lucky enough to recover such items could unlock their hidden potential should their own exploits prove worthy. The following items work much like the scaling items introduced in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, save that each has a unique reward ability unlocked by attaining a goal related to the item's original owner. These items represent famous possessions of specific individuals from the history of Golarion, so unlike typical magic items, they cannot be crafted, though they can still be destroyed normally.

Description

The hilt of this +1 adamantine scimitar has a gritty texture, as if sprinkled with invisible grains of sand. A favorite weapon among the Templars of the Five Winds during their struggle against the genie binder Kinroth, in the hands of a mighty warrior this blade can cut through spell and shackle alike. After the Templars defeated the efreeti Jhavhul in 4300 ar, their <a href="monsterdisplay19a4.html?ItemName=Djinni">djinni</a> leader, Nefeshti, passed the blade to a group of worthy adventurers, though what happened to the blade afterward has been lost to history.

When the wielder of the scimitar of deliverance hits a target with a melee attack, as a free action she can attempt to identify any abjuration spells currently effecting the target as if she had studied it for 3 rounds using <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a>.

7th Level: The scimitar of deliverance acts as a +2 <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7362.html?ItemName=Keen">keen</a> adamantine scimitar.

11th Level: As a full-round action, the wielder can flourish the scimitar of deliverance. All creatures within 60 feet who see the display can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +4 morale bonus against any effect they are under that causes the confused, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, shaken, or staggered condition.

15th Level: The scimitar of deliverance acts as a +4 keen adamantine scimitar.

19th Level: Once per round when the wielder confirms a critical hit against a target with the scimitar of deliverance, the foe is targeted by a <a href="spelldisplay9665.html?ItemName=">greater dispel magic</a> spell, with a caster level equal to the wielder's character level.

Goal: The bearer must free at least 50 creatures from captivity, slavery, or unlawful imprisonment.

Reward: As an immediate action a number of times per day equal to his character level, the wielder can use <a href="spelldisplay40df.html?ItemName=liberating%20command">liberating command</a> as a spell-like ability.
