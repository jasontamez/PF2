Scaling Items - Magic Equipment









Legacy Items


Whether members of professionally acquisitive organizations such as the Pathfinder Society or simply amateur treasure hunters, adventurers dream of discovering powerful relics wielded by legendary figures from the murky past. While these might be simple artifacts or heirlooms, some rare items are infused by the mighty deeds of their former owners, and an adventurer lucky enough to recover such items could unlock their hidden potential should their own exploits prove worthy. The following items work much like the scaling items introduced in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, save that each has a unique reward ability unlocked by attaining a goal related to the item's original owner. These items represent famous possessions of specific individuals from the history of Golarion, so unlike typical magic items, they cannot be crafted, though they can still be destroyed normally.

Description

According to records salvaged from abandoned temples of Aroden, the high priest Narthoc was wearing a ring of sealed souls when he trapped the <a href="mythicmonsterdisplay333d.html?ItemName=Whispering%20Tyrant">Whispering Tyrant</a> under Gallowspire in 3827 ar.

If the wearer of this braided ring is slain while wearing the ring, he cannot be raised as undead. Additionally, the wearer can be revived with <a href="spelldisplay0d07.html?ItemName=raise%20dead">raise dead</a> or similar effects even if he was slain by a death effect.

8th Level: The wearer can use <a href="spelldisplay9665.html?ItemName=">hold portal</a> at will as a spell-like ability, though he can have only one portal held by this ability at a time. Should he use the ability again while the spell is already active, the first casting is immediately dismissed.

11th Level: Weapons wielded by the wearer gain the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> weapon property.

14th Level: The wearer can use <a href="spelldisplaye025.html?ItemName=guards%20and%20wards">guards and wards</a> once per day as a spell-like ability.

17th Level: The wearer adds <a href="spelldisplayf8a0.html?ItemName=binding">binding</a> to his class spell list and list of spells known. The wearer can use <a href="spelldisplayf8a0.html?ItemName=binding">binding</a> once per day as a spell-like ability, but he must provide the expensive material component for the spell.

Goal: The wearer must defeat an undead creature or evil outsider whose CR is at least 4 greater than his Hit Dice.

Reward: The wearer is constantly under the effect of <a href="spelldisplay435e.html?ItemName=protection%20from%20evil">protection from evil</a> with a caster level equal to his character level. Should this effect be dispelled, he can resume it as a free action.
