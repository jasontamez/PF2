Scaling Items - Magic Equipment









Legacy Items


Whether members of professionally acquisitive organizations such as the Pathfinder Society or simply amateur treasure hunters, adventurers dream of discovering powerful relics wielded by legendary figures from the murky past. While these might be simple artifacts or heirlooms, some rare items are infused by the mighty deeds of their former owners, and an adventurer lucky enough to recover such items could unlock their hidden potential should their own exploits prove worthy. The following items work much like the scaling items introduced in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, save that each has a unique reward ability unlocked by attaining a goal related to the item's original owner. These items represent famous possessions of specific individuals from the history of Golarion, so unlike typical magic items, they cannot be crafted, though they can still be destroyed normally.

The chasing of this +1 mithral breastplate makes it appear to be crafted of dragon's scales. Originally worn by Choral Rogarvia, the armor was imitated, at great expense, by Issian nobles hoping to curry favor with the new ruler of Brevoy, but its power was never duplicated.

The armor's dazzling finish often impresses onlookers, and its wearer can adjust a creature's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy, instead of the normal limit of two steps.

5th Level: Conqueror's breastplate acts as a +2 mithral breastplate.

10th Level: Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can use <a href="spelldisplay216e.html?ItemName=draconic%20reservoir">draconic reservoir</a> as a spell-like ability.

15th Level: Conqueror's breastplate acts as a +3 <a href="magicarmordisplay6bdc.html?ItemName=Determination">determination</a> mithral breastplate.

Goal: At least 20 people whose CR is equal to or greater than the wearer's Hit Dice - 4 must swear fealty or pledge their loyalty to the wearer.

Reward: The wearer's grandiose bearing cows the weak willed. He gains the <a href="umr4581.html?ItemName=Frightful%20Presence">frightful presence</a> universal monster ability with a 30-foot-radius range and a Will save DC equal to 10 + his character level + his Charisma modifier. He can suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
