Scaling Items - Magic Equipment









Legacy Items


Whether members of professionally acquisitive organizations such as the Pathfinder Society or simply amateur treasure hunters, adventurers dream of discovering powerful relics wielded by legendary figures from the murky past. While these might be simple artifacts or heirlooms, some rare items are infused by the mighty deeds of their former owners, and an adventurer lucky enough to recover such items could unlock their hidden potential should their own exploits prove worthy. The following items work much like the scaling items introduced in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, save that each has a unique reward ability unlocked by attaining a goal related to the item's original owner. These items represent famous possessions of specific individuals from the history of Golarion, so unlike typical magic items, they cannot be crafted, though they can still be destroyed normally.
