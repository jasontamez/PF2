Scaling Items - Magic Equipment









Legacy Items


Whether members of professionally acquisitive organizations such as the Pathfinder Society or simply amateur treasure hunters, adventurers dream of discovering powerful relics wielded by legendary figures from the murky past. While these might be simple artifacts or heirlooms, some rare items are infused by the mighty deeds of their former owners, and an adventurer lucky enough to recover such items could unlock their hidden potential should their own exploits prove worthy. The following items work much like the scaling items introduced in Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, save that each has a unique reward ability unlocked by attaining a goal related to the item's original owner. These items represent famous possessions of specific individuals from the history of Golarion, so unlike typical magic items, they cannot be crafted, though they can still be destroyed normally.

Description

Unlike most <a href="magicwondrousdisplay6a2a.html?FinalName=Figurine%20of%20Wondrous%20PowerSilver%20Raven">figurines of wondrous power</a>, this amber statuette depicts three creatures rather than one a dire tiger, a mastodon, and a megaloceros locked in an eternal battle. This powerful totem was created by orc shamans for the warlord Belkzen to aid in his conquest of the dwarven stronghold of Koldukar. To this day, many orcs are fascinated with the strength and ferocity of the megafauna that roam the edges of the Hold of Belkzen. While orcs might seek the massive creatures as prey or train them as powerful allies in battle, the totemic figurine magically harnesses the power of these megafauna.

The totemic figurine follows all the normal rules for figurines of wondrous power. When animated, the totemic figurine turns into a <a href="monsterdisplay7261.html?ItemName=Megaloceros">megaloceros</a> that understands Common and is under the command of the figurine's bearer. The totemic figurine can be used up to 3 times per week for up to 1 hour with each use. Should the creature be slain while it is animated, it reverts to the form of a statuette and cannot be activated for 1 week.

7th Level: The bearer gains the <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">wild empathy</a> class feature as a druid of her character level, but the ability is effective only with dinosaurs, dire tigers, mastodons, and other megafauna.

11th Level: The totemic figurine can instead take the form of a <a href="monsterdisplayffd2.html?ItemName=Dire%20Tiger%20(Smilodon)">dire tiger</a>.

15th Level: The totemic figurine can instead take the form of a <a href="monsterdisplayf345.html?ItemName=Mastodon">mastodon</a>.

Goal: The bearer must successfully rear a dinosaur, dire tiger, mastodon, or other megafauna from infancy using the Handle Animal skill.

Reward: Dinosaurs, dire tigers, mastodons, and other megafauna will not willingly attack the bearer unless they are magically compelled to do so or the bearer attacks them first. In addition, the bearer can spend one use to cause the totemic figurine to take the form of two different creatures at once.
