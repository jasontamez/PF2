Description

This imposing stone throne is ornamented with heavy chains radiating outward from the central seat. A throne of fetters provides a continuous heroism effect to the ruler or anyone related to the ruler by blood or marriage seated on it. Acknowledging a ruler (or a member of the ruler's family) seated upon the throne grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Constitution checks and a +1 morale bonus on Fortitude saving throws for 24 hours. A creature can choose to expend this blessing before the duration expires as an immediate action by crying, "My freedom for yours!" Doing so causes spectral fetters to appear around the creature's ankles, reducing its base land speed by 20 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and granting a freedom of movement effect to the creature seated upon the throne. Both of these effects last for 1 minute.
