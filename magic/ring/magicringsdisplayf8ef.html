Description

A ring of craft magic always bears some sort of tool-like design in its craftsmanship. The wearer of the ring sees spells as similar to crafts, and vice versa. The wearer may make a Craft check in place of a Spellcraft check to identify an item that could be created with that Craft skill. The wearer may also expend a spell slot or prepared spell to gain an enhancement bonus equal to the level of the expended spell on a single Craft or Profession check (regardless of the amount of time needed to make the check).
