Description

This delicate ring of forged bronze is formed into the shape of two hands, which do not quite touch as they meet at the top of the wearer's finger. A ring of the clean hands grants use of telekinesis as a standard action and has 10 charges. These charges return at the start of the next day.

The ring's charges can be expended to create the following effects:

Combat maneuver: This effect costs 3 charges for each round it is active, but otherwise functions as described by the spell telekinesis. The force created by this effect has a +9 base attack bonus, and is considered to have Strength 20 and Dexterity 20.

Force lash: This effect costs 3 charges, striking out as if with an invisible whip. One target within 60 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be struck for 4d6 points of nonlethal damage. This attack does not affect targets with a +3 or higher natural armor bonus, or a +1 or higher armor bonus.

Sustained force: This effect costs 1 charge for each round it is active, but otherwise functions as described by the spell telekinesis, making it capable of lifting 225 lbs.

Violent thrust: This effect costs 5 charges, but otherwise functions as described by the spell telekinesis, allowing you to throw up to 9 creatures or objects up to 90 feet, with a total weight of 225 lbs. The attack roll has a +9 modifier. The Will save is DC 17.
