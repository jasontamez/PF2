Description

Once per day, the wearer of this charred bone ring may, as an immediate action, cause it to detonate in a 30-footradius burst that deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 14 half). If the wearer is killed by the detonation, all magical equipment he carries must also save or take fire damage, and all nonmagical equipment takes this damage with no saving throw. This explosion never destroys the ring.
