Description

This adamantine band is capped with a stone sigil of the first clan to settle the Sky Citadel of Kraggodan. This ring is keyed to interact with several devices and traps within the vaults'storehouses of ancient history and family wealth-of the Sky Citadel. The ring grants its wearer acid resistance 10. Three times per day as a swift action, the wearer can make himself undetectable by crafted and magical traps and creatures of the construct type for the following minute. This functions like greater invisibility within these limits and also prevents the character's weight or presence from triggering traps.
