Description

This golden ring is set with a large, almost gaudy onyx that can open to reveal a hidden compartment with just enough room for a single dose of powdered poison. This ring provides a +2 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal this poison on the wearer's body. In addition, the ring contains four charges that recharge each day. When drawing a poison from the band of efficacious death, the wearer can tap the onyx up to four times to increase the frequency of the poison by 1 increment per tap. For example, if the poison's frequency were 1/round for 2 rounds, by touching the onyx once, the frequency would become 1/round for 3 rounds.
