Description

This single thick iron band makes for a rather ugly ring. Rust pits the surface of the ring in places and the item seems on the brink of falling apart. Occasionally, these rings bear a tiny chain link or dented tankard symbol.

While wearing a ring of emancipation, you gain a +2 competence bonus on all Open Lock and Escape Artist checks, in addition to all attack rolls made to sunder. Also, the ring has three charges, which can be expended at any time to cast shatter as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your character level. Each time a charge is expended, the ring becomes more rusted and marred. Upon the third charge being expended, the ring is destroyed.

Construction

Requirements Forge Ring, cat's grace, shatter; Cost 1,050 gp, 84 XP
