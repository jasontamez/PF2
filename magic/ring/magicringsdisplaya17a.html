Description

This extravagant ring is heavy with precious jewels. As fashions change (or as the wearer's fancy shifts), the wearer can alter the appearance of her armor, clothing, and even weaponry at will as a standard action; this change is illusory and doesn't affect the actual abilities of gear or weapons (although drastic changes in size are beyond the scope of this ability). A ring of splendid security's primary purpose, though, is to grant the wearer protection from harm. As long as it is worn, the ring grants the wearer a +5 deflection bonus to her AC, a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws, and spell resistance 22.
