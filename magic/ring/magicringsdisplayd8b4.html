Description

This platinum thimble, intricately crafted in the shape of an animal claw, is worn on one finger. A vampire wearer can use the thimble to inflict a tiny wound as part of the use of a blood drain, energy drain, or drain chi ability; use of the thimble in this way isn't an action. This wound deals no additional damage, but it turns the target's pain to pleasure. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or become fascinated by the wearer and make no attempt to resist the draining on that round and the following 2 rounds. At the end of this time, the creature's senses return and it can react accordingly.
