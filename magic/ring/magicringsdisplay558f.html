Description

A dozen tiny gemstones line the outer edges of this golden ring. As long as one or more creatures can see it, the ring grants its wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to influence those creatures. In addition, the wearer can allow a willing creature to inspect the ring as a full-round action. If she does, for the following 3 rounds the creature and the wearer can speak while the ring's power obfuscates the details of the conversation. To every other creature able to hear the creature and the wearer's words during this time, the conversation sounds like a continued back-and-forth exchange of exaltations about the ring's artistry.
