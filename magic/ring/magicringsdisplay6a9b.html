Description

A jailer's dungeon ring is worked gold, set with carnelians. The ring is magically attuned to one or more iron prisoner's dungeon rings. When the wearer of a jailer's ring places a prisoner's ring on a subject, the prisoner cannot remove the ring without the use of a remove curse, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. The wearer of the jailer's ring can also remove a linked prisoner's ring at any time.

The jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked prisoner's ring as per a constant status spell. Additionally, all wearers of linked prisoner's rings count as familiar to the jailer for the purposes of spells such as scrying and teleport.
