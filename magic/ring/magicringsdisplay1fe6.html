Description

This gray ring looks like stone, but the material is soft and flexible. Once per day, as a standard action, you can touch a stone wall with your hand to create a stone duplicate of yourself.

Immediately upon activating the ring of the stone sibling, your double steps out of the wall. It appears to be a stone statue carved in an exact likeness of you. The stone double stands 10 feet away from you and mimics your movements, as if reflected in a mirror. As a move-equivalent action, you can mentally command the stone sibling to move to a new location, but it must remain within 30 feet of you at all times.

The stone sibling has hardness 8 and 50 hit points. It can take no actions other than to aid you, which it does every round on your turn. The stone sibling makes a +5 aid another check each round, either to aid your attack rolls or your Armor Class, as you command. It continues to render the same aid indefinitely until you command it otherwise (which requires a move action).

The stone sibling lasts for 10 minutes, until it is destroyed, or until you dismiss it (a standard action), whichever comes first.
