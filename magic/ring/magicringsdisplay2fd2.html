Description

Powerful gillmen who suspect they harbor unwitting allegiance to hidden masters use rings of refusal to resist such bonds. The wearer of a ring of refusal gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects. When the wearer is targeted by break enchantment or a similar effect that ends an enchantment, the caster gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to resolve the effect.

The wearer can also activate the ring once per day as an immediate action to gain spell resistance 25 against a single enchantment spell or effect.
