Description

This ornate ring of protection +2 is emblazoned with the winged Eye of Aroden in ruby and jet. The wearer of a duxotar's signet projects an air of commanding authority that affects large groups; the wearer does not treat crowds as difficult terrain and gains a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to direct or influence crowds (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 436-437). The wearer can also cast magic mouth at will, but the message trigger must be "upon seeing a creature wearing the Eye of Aroden" (which triggers the magic mouth for any dottari in uniform).

Construction

Requirements Forge Ring, eagle's splendor, magic mouth, shield of faith; Cost 7,750 gp
