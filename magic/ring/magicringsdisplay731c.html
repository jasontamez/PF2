Description

Rings of this type come in a wide variety of designs and colorations, typically related to the types of energy they defend against. These rings continually protect their wearers from damage from one type of energy-acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage dealt.

A minor ring of energy resistance grants 10 points of resistance. A major ring of energy resistance grants 20 points of resistance. A greater ring of energy resistance grants 30 points of resistance.
