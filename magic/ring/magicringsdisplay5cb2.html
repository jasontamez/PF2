Description

This white-gold ring bears the relief image of a roaring lion. Once per day on command, the wearer can point the ring and mentally designate one or more creatures or objects in a 60-foot cone as enemies, after which the ring roars triumphantly. Selected targets in the area are affected by <a href="spelldisplay5da2.html?ItemName=shout">shout</a> (Fortitude DC 20). All other objects in the area are unharmed, and all other creatures in the area receive the benefits of the <a href="classdisplayaec9.html?ItemName=Bard">inspire courage bardic performance</a> as performed by a 7th-level bard for 3 rounds. When activating the ring, the wearer can expend 1 round of her bardic performance ability to use her own bard level to calculate the performance's effect.

In addition, the ring grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma; treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the ring is worn.
