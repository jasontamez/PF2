Description

This simple silver ring has a fear rune etched into its
hammered apex. The ring provides a morale bonus versus
fear effects. This bonus starts at +0 and can advance no
higher than +5.

Every time the wearer succeeds at a Will save versus a fear
affect, the ring's bonus increases by +1. Should the wearer
fail a Will save versus fear, the ring's bonus immediately falls
to +0.

If the bonus is +5 and the wearer is affected by a fear
effect and succeeds at her Will save, the ring automatically
reflects the fear effect back to its source. If the source is a
creature not immune to fear, it must succeed at a Will save at
the DC made by the ring's wearer or be affected by the fear
effect. Only the source of an area fear effect is targeted by
such a reflected spell.
