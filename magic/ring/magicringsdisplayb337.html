Description

A ring of immolation is made of pumice and hardened ash but is as strong as metal. As a free action, the wearer can activate the ring to create a <a href="spelldisplay2025.html?ItemName=fire%20shield">fire shield</a> (warm) on himself. The wearer of a ring of immolation can activate a <a href="spelldisplay2025.html?ItemName=fire%20shield">fire shield</a> on himself for up to 10 rounds each day (these rounds need not be used consecutively). If the wearer would take magical cold damage and any rounds of duration remain, the ring automatically activates for 1 round and protects the wearer from the cold damage as per <a href="spelldisplay2025.html?ItemName=fire%20shield">fire shield</a>.
