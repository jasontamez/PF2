Description

Seven mithral strips weave their way around these steel bracers, which thrum ever so faintly with the force of stabilizing magic. When the wearer activates a magic item, casts a spell, or uses a spell-like ability that triggers a primal magic event (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 13), the resulting event is rolled (or otherwise determined) twice, and the caster can choose which of the two events occur. The bracers also allow the wearer to roll twice and choose the result when using a rod of wonder.
