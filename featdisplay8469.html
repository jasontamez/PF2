You have trained to fight while submerged in water.

Prerequisites: Swim 1 rank.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Swim checks and don't take the usual penalties on melee attack rolls made underwater. Your slashing melee attacks and unarmed bludgeoning attacks deal full damage underwater.

Normal: When you're underwater, most of your melee attacks take a -2 penalty and deal only half damage.
