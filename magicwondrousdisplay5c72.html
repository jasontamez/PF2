Description

This plain cloak only has any effect when worn by a member
of a half-human race, such as a half-orc or half-elf. It alters
the wearer's appearance similarly to a hat of disguise, but
only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer's nonhuman
physical traits so the creature appears fully human.
Any feature that is plausibly human remains. For example,
a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his green or gray skin
color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise
completely able to pass as a human version of his normal
self. Likewise, a half-elf wearing the cloak has round ears,
humanlike eyes, and no other traits indicating elven ancestry.
The wearer has no control over the specific guise, and those
familiar with his normal appearance can recognize him in his
human guise.
