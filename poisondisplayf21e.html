Description

Often employed by spies and saboteurs, sweetdream is a potent sedative with useful amnesia-causing side effects. The memory loss is a mind-affecting effect.

Victims of sweetdream often experience pleasant, fanciful dreams when affected by the poison's secondary effect, a fact that both inspired the poison its name and contributed to its medicinal use among those plagued by nightmares or insomnia. Unlike similar drugs, sweetdream is not habit-forming, and thus users have no risk of developing a physiological addiction to the inhaled powder. However, once a frequent user becomes accustomed to the poison's effects, he often finds himself unable to sleep without it, leading some authorities to ban its willing use.
