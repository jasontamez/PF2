Description

These gloves are made of pale gray silk; each is adorned with
an embroidered silver eye on the back. Once per day the wearer
may activate them, as a standard action, by bowing her head
and pressing her hands to her eyes. The embroidered silver
eyes flare and open, and when the wearer lowers her hands,
deep pools of swirling gray mist hide her own eyes and allow
her to more clearly see the restless dead for the next 10 rounds.
While active, ghostvision gloves grant the following effects.
<ul><li>The wearer can see all undead within 60 feet clearly,
including ethereal undead and incorporeal undead hiding in
objects or walls to a depth of 5 feet.
</li><li>If the wearer has the channel positive energy class ability,
she may expend one use of channeled positive energy to make a
ranged touch attack against one undead creature within channel
range. If the ranged touch attack hits, she rolls channel energy
damage against that target (affecting no other creatures), except
she rolls d12s instead of d6s.
</li><li>While the gloves are active, constructs and living opponents
treat the wearer as blind.</li></ul>
