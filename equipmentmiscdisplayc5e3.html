Description

The bowl of this glass water pipe can be loaded with any inhalable drug, alchemical powder, or alchemical liquid. You must set down a hookah in a free space (a move action) and fill the water jar with half a gallon of water (another move action) before the hookah can be used. You can consume the contents of an adjacent hookah by sucking on one of the pipe's four hoses as a move action. Up to 5 doses of a single substance can be loaded in the hookah at a time, and up to four adjacent creatures can use the hookah during the same round. Reloading a hookah is a standard action, regardless of the number of doses so reloaded.

Substances not intended for bodily consumption can cause harmful or even fatal effects (GM's discretion) if loaded into a hookah and inhaled, and often destroy the hookah in the process.
