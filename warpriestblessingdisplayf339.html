Lore Keeper (minor): At 1st level, you can touch a creature to learn about its abilities and weaknesses. With a successful touch attack, you gain information as if your result on the appropriate Knowledge skill check were equal to 15 + your warpriest level + your Wisdom modifier.

Monster Lore (major): At 10th level, when you succeed at a Knowledge check against an opponent to learn about its abilities or weaknesses (or succeed at a touch attack using the lore keeper blessing, above), you can as a swift action gain a +2 insight bonus on attacks, saving throws, and ability and skill checks, as well as to your AC against that creature. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
