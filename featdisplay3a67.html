You are able to draw up available vegetation into your body mass and increase your size and strength.

Prerequisites: Shambling mound.

Benefit: As a full-round action, you may draw additional vegetable matter into yourself and increase your size, strength, and durability as if using an animal growth spell. At the beginning of each turn, you must succeed at a Fortitude save to maintain your increased size. The save DC is 10 if in forest or jungle and 15 if in a swamp or underground , and increases by 1 for each round that passes. If you fail the save, you collapse back to your normal size and are fatigued for 8 hours.

Special: You must be in forest, jungle, swamp, or underground terrain to use this feat. You cannot use this feat when you are fatigued or exhausted.
