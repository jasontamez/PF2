Description

These tight-fitting, black leather gloves have reinforced fingertips marked with arcane sigils. The gloves prickle slightly when in the presence of portals to other planes. The wearer gains a +5 bonus on Perception and Knowledge (planes) checks to identify portals and planar connections and can automatically learn where such connections lead by touching the portal or a connected area (such as a wall) within 10 feet of it.
