The repulsive horror of your smothering attack nearly incapacitates most foes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay5188.html?ItemName=Engulf%20Revulsion">Engulf Revulsion</a>; engulf or smother universal monster ability.

Benefit: When you successfully engulf or smother an opponent, successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on a smothered opponent, the opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or become staggered for 1 round. This is a mindaffecting fear effect.
