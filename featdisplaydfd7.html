Your feverish and sometimes comical defensive techniques offer enough distraction to aid allies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay47ae.html?ItemName=Cautious%20Fighter">Cautious Fighter</a>, halfling.

Benefit:  Whenever you fight defensively or use the total defense action, allies gain a luck bonus to AC and CMD equal to 1/2 the dodge bonus you gain from the action you are taking. Allies only gain this bonus while they are adjacent to you.
