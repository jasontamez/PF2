Description

This seemingly delicate silver rose is rigid and nearly unbreakable. When wearing the rose openly on his chest, the wearer treats all of his natural attacks, unarmed attacks, and weapon attacks as if they were made using silver weapons. The wearer can expend one use of mythic power when making a melee attack against an enemy that possesses DR/silver to negate that DR for a number of rounds equal to the wearer's mythic tier.
