Description

This finely polished wooden amulet has the image of a
blindfolded medusa carved upon its surface. Whenever the
wearer fails a saving throw that would result in him being
turned to stone, he is instead staggered for 1d6 rounds. If a
spell or effect turns him to stone without allowing a saving
throw, he is instead staggered for 1 minute. These abilities
do not function while the wearer is staggered.
