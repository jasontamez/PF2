Description

This translucent dust warps harmful magical auras, making it difficult to discern cursed items from beneficial ones. Sprinkling the dust over a cursed magic item shields it from divination magic for 5 days. When identifying the item, a creature must exceed the item's DC by 15 (instead of by 10) to determine whether the item is cursed. If a creature activates the curse while the item is under this effect, treat the curse's caster level as 2 higher for the purpose of resisting spells such as remove curse and break enchantment.

The dust can also be scattered over a magical glyph, rune, or symbol to increase the DC to find and disable the trap by 5 for 5 days.
