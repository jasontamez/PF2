You entangle your foe in your weapon.

Prerequisites: Fury's Fall, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip.</a>

Benefit: If you successfully use a whip to trip a foe, you can choose to drop your whip. Your tripped target gains the entangled condition. The target can break free of the whip by making a DC 10 Strength check or a DC 15 Escape Artist check (add the enhancement bonus of the whip to these DCs), or by using a full-round action to disentangle himself. Escaping the whip by making a Strength check means the whip gains the broken condition. If the whip has a magical quality such as flaming, apply this quality's damage to the target every round on your turn.
