Together, you and your allies tear through enemies' defenses.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplayae7c.html?ItemName=Rat%20Stack">Rat Stack</a>, swarming racial trait.

Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all melee damage rolls for each allied creature you share a square with that also has this feat.

If two or more allies sharing a square have this feat and hit the same adjacent creature in a round, they tear it in different directions, dealing additional damage at the end of the round. This rend attack deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + the highest Strength modifier of all qualifying allies in the same square who struck the target this round.
