Dreadful Carnage (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 158</a>
Slaying an enemy demoralizes your other nearby foes.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, <a href="featdisplay8fa9.html?ItemName=Furious%20Focus">Furious Focus</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  Whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can make an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a free action. Enemies that cannot see both you and the enemy you reduced to 0 or fewer hit points are unaffected.

When you reduce an enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can spend up to 6 stamina points to increase the radius of this feat's effect by 5 feet for each stamina point you spent (to a maximum of 60 feet).

Mythic Dreadful Carnage

Your kills are truly frightening to behold.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayda9b.html?ItemName=Dreadful%20Carnage">Dreadful Carnage.</a>

Benefit:  When you use Dreadful Carnage, you affect non-mythic enemies within 60 feet in addition to all enemies within 30 feet. You can expend one use of mythic power before making the Intimidate check to cause enemies demoralized by Dreadful Carnage to become frightened instead of shaken, for the same duration as the normal shaken effect. While frightened by this ability, an enemy takes a penalty equal to your tier on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
