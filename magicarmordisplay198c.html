Description

Gale armor is a suit of +3 silken ceremonial armor that floats weightlessly when not worn. Gale armor has no weight of its own and confers limited weightlessness on its wearer. The wearer of a suit of gale armor can use air walk up to 10 rounds per day. Activating or deactivating this ability is a free action, and these rounds need not be consecutive. Additionally, the wearer of a suit of gale armor is permanently under the effect of glide, and if he's capable of flying, the armor increases his maneuverability by one category.
