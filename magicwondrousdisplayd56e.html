Description

This device looks like a giant glass tube set within a protective iron cage. The glass tube is scrawled with hundreds of mystic sigils and filled with strange tubes and fluids. Bolts around the iron lip of the tube allow it to be fastened into the wearers flesh, while dozens of tubes and probes connect to the wearer's upper body. The device is designed for a creature lacking a lower body or at least missing its legs; it can only effectively be used by undead, as a living creature would almost certainly die from the item grafting itself to his body and removing extraneous flesh to do so (though the character could be raised from the dead or animated as an undead after this death).

When properly attached, you may fly at speed 30 (perfect maneuverability). You gain a +4 armor bonus to AC.
