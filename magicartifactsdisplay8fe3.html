Description

This artifact was crafted ages ago, weaving together wispy
strands of shadow into a twisted black staff. The Shadowstaff
makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting
him a +4 bonus to AC and on Reflex saves (which stacks with
any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of
the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder
takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The
Shadowstaff also has these powers.
<ul><li>Summon Shadows: Three times per day the staff may
summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the
wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at
20th level.
</li><li>Summon Nightshade: Once per month, the staff can
summon an advanced shadow demon that serves the
wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at
20th level.
</li><li>Shadow Form: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by
gaseous form.
</li><li>Shadow Bolt: Three times per day the staff can project a
ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single
target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.</li></ul>

Destruction

The Shadowstaff fades away to nothingness if it is exposed to
true sunlight for a continuous 24 hour period.
