<tr>
<td>Aasimar</a>: Creatures blessed with a celestial bloodline, aasimars seem human except for some exotic quality that betrays their otherworldly origin.

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplayf05a.html?ItemName=Android">Android</a>: The artificially constructed humanoids known as androids are as much a miracle of technological achievement as they are an example of the sheer will of the multiverse.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplaya353.html?ItemName=Astomoi">Astomoi</a>: These mysterious humanoids require no food-indeed, they have no mouths-and they have no eyes with which to survey their environment. Instead, they rely on their powerful minds to sense the world around them, and subsist on nutrients absorbed from the air. This can turn against them, however, as powerful smells and inhaled poisons can render an astomoi helpless. Predisposed to asceticism, astomoi rarely wear more than rags, if they wear anything at all.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplayfb92.html?ItemName=Being%20of%20Ib">Being of Ib</a>: Living examples of this time-forgotten race may yet exist on distant worlds, or they could be resurrected by curious spellcasters. A living being of Ib is not a very dangerous creature, but those who gain levels in spellcasting classes can become quite formidable; they overwhelmingly prefer divine spellcasting classes and typically venerate Bokrug.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplayde00.html?ItemName=Drow">Drow</a>: Dark reflections of surface elves, drow are shadowy hunters who strive to snuff out the world's light.

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplay6b50.html?ItemName=Drow%20Noble">Drow Noble</a>: About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth-the overwhelming majority of these exceptional drow are female, and as a result, drow society tends to be matriarchal in nature.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Fetchling</a>: Long ago, fetchlings were humans exiled to the Shadow Plane, but that plane's persistent umbra has transformed them into a race apart.

</tr><tr>
<td>Gathlain</a>: According to some fey ballads, gathlains were one of the first peoples awakened in the First World, the primal realm of the fey.

They are known to be invaluable guides and knowledgeable explorers, if one can put up with their numerous questions and strange japes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ghoran</a>: The first ghorans came into being thousands of years ago during a great war between two nations ruled by rival archmages. When mighty necromantic curses blighted the lands of one nation, leaving its inhabitants on the brink of starvation, their canny leader cut a deal with the renegade druid Ghorus, bidding him to put his forbidden talents to use in saving the realm. The druid's solution was the creation of a race of hardy and fast-adapting plants that could thrive even upon the curse-blighted ground. These plants, which the druid named "ghorans" after himself, swiftly developed the ability to move on their own, searching out the most nourishing soil and continuously adapting themselves to survive in more and more dangerous environments. As they grew in intelligence, ghorans evolved humanlike forms as a defense mechanism to induce sympathy and prevent further butchery.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplay9fb6.html?ItemName=Gillman">Gillman</a>: Survivors of a land-dwelling culture whose homeland was destroyed, gillmen were saved and transformed into an amphibious race by the aboleths.

Reclusive and suspicious, gillmen know that one day the aboleths will call in the debt owed to them.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Goblin</a>: Crazy pyromaniacs with a tendency to commit unspeakable violence, goblins are the smallest of the goblinoid races.

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplay45d6.html?ItemName=Hobgoblin">Hobgoblin</a>: These creatures are the most disciplined and militaristic of the goblinoid races. Tall, tough as nails, and strongly built, hobgoblins would be a boon to any adventuring group, were it not for the fact that they tend to be cruel and malicious, and often keep slaves.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ifrit</a>: Ifrits are a race descended from mortals and the strange inhabitants of the Plane of Fire. Their physical traits and personalities often betray their fiery origins, and they tend to be restless, independent, and imperious.

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="racesdisplay83e3.html?ItemName=Kobold">Kobold</a>: Considering themselves the scions of dragons, kobolds have diminutive statures but massive egos. A select few can take on more draconic traits than their kin, and many are powerful sorcerers, canny alchemists, and cunning rogues.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Tiefling</a>: Diverse and often despised by humanoid society, tieflings are mortals stained with the blood of fiends.
