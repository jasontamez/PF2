Description

This fingerless leather glove includes four small pouches along the knuckle line into which you can insert tiny glass vials. You can fill the vials with poison or ground minerals. When you punch someone in the face, the vials shatter, releasing their contents into the target's face and eyes. Together, the four vials hold 1 dose of poison or ground minerals; there is no effect unless all four are full.

Diamond Dust Vials (25 gp): These vials are filled with finely ground mineral crystals. When you shatter a vial with your punch, the target you hit must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save to shield its eyes or be temporarily blinded for 1 round.
