Those with an inherent connection to magic often attract creatures who feel a similar instinctive pull toward magical forces. At 1st level, a sorcerer, bloodrager, or any other character with one of the following bloodlines can choose to gain a bloodline familiar. The character gains a familiar (as a wizard's familiar), treating her class level as her wizard level for the purposes of this ability. This familiar has an additional ability listed below based on the master's bloodline.

This replaces the 1st-level bloodline power granted by the character's bloodline; in addition, the character gains bonus spells from her bloodline one level later than she normally would. For example, a sorcerer with the aberrant bloodline who takes a bloodline familiar would not gain the acidic ray bloodline power, and she would gain her first bonus spell at 4th level, her second bonus spell at 6th level, and so on.

GMs may use the following bloodline familiar abilities as written, or employ them as guidelines for devising bloodline familiar abilities for bloodlines not listed below.

Aberrant'Squeezer (Ex):  The familiar gains the compression ability, allowing it to move through an area as small as one-quarter its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing.

Abyssal-Grotesque Appendages (Ex): The damage dice of each of the familiar's natural attacks increases by one die step.

Arcane'Spell Catalyst (Su): Spells you cast that target your familiar are treated as having a caster level 2 levels higher than your actual caster level.

Celestial-Heavenly Touch (Su): A number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modif ier, your familiar can grant fast healing 1 to an allied creature it's touching. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modif ier (minimum 1) or until the familiar stops touching the creature, whichever comes first. At 10th level, the familiar grants fast healing 2 instead. At 20th level, the familiar grants fast healing 3 instead.

Destined-Foretold Touch (Su): The familiar gains a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls to deliver touch spells, and the DC of touch spells delivered by the familiar increases by 1. These benefits increase by 1 at 10th level and again at 20th level.

Draconic-Dragon's Flight (Ex): The familiar can sprout draconic wings, granting it a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability for a number of minutes per day equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 10th level, the familiar's fly speed increases to 60 feet with good maneuverability. At 20th level, the familiar's fly speed increases to 90 feet.

Elemental-Dualistic Energy (Su): When your familiar delivers a touch spell that deals energy damage of a type other than your chosen energy type, your familiar can choose to alter the spell so that half of the energy damage dealt is of the spell's original type and the other half is of your chosen energy type.

Fey-Amusing Familiar (Su): The familiar can fascinate other creatures as the fascinate bardic performance, treating your caster level as its bard level and using your Charisma modifier for the purpose of calculating the Will save DC. The familiar cannot perform any other actions while using this ability.

Infernal-Hellish Aura (Su): Animals don't willingly approach the familiar unless the animal's master succeeds at a DC 15 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. This DC increases to 20 at 10th level, and to 25 at 20th level. Animal companions, familiars and mounts are immune to this effect.

Undead-Unliving Physiology (Su): The familiar is alive, but is treated as undead for all effects that affect undead differently from living creatures, such as cure spells and channeled energy.
