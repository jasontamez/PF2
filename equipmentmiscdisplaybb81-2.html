Description

These long-reaching extenders can be attached to or detached from thieves' tools as a standard action, allowing the user to make Disable Device checks on devices in any space he could reach with a reach weapon. High-quality mirrors on the shafts let him see what he's doing, but he takes a -4 penalty on Disable Device checks when working on a device more than 5 feet away.
