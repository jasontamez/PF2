Scaling items must be crafted at their highest level of power, with a cost determined by referencing <a href="rulesd734.html?Name=Adjusting%20Treasure&amp;Category=Scaling%20Items">Table 4-13</a>. Start with the value listed on the table for the item's category and its highest-level ability. Divide this by 2 to get the crafting cost, and add the value of any nonmagical armor or weapon component. The crafting cost is always much higher than the market price of a scaling item, since the crafting cost is based on the full set of abilities but the market price is based on the minimum caster level. When a PC crafts a scaling item, he doesn't need to pay any further cost in reduced treasure for keeping the item, because the full value of the item has already been accounted for. When setting the DC for crafting a scaling item, use the item's highest-level ability instead of its base caster level.
