Gaming groups thrive on feedback. Enthusiastic players spur the GM to continue creating exciting adventures and make the daunting task of running a game worthwhile, while the GM complimenting a player on his roleplaying, strategy, or teamwork can help educate and make the party more cohesive. A GM or player who compliments others also inspires others to share positive feedback and are most likely to be taken seriously when offering criticism.

Constructive criticism is just as important as positive reinforcement, but it should be handled more carefully. When possible, raise any individual issues with players in private. Phrasing such criticism as a request for assistance often makes the process easier. For example, if a player is getting caustic toward a teammate over the latter's limited rules knowledge, you might ask that he help educate the neophyte player. Similarly, if one player's character is constantly disrupting the game by heading off in different directions, you could ask that player to help you keep the group on track-many players understand the difficulties of GMing, and may play differently if they see themselves as sharing that responsibility.
