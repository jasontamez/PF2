Night Monarch - Monsters







Herald, Night Monarch

This immense butterfly-like creature has the face of a moth, brightly colored wings and body, and a long three-pronged tail that looks like peacock feathers. As it beats its wings, a light misting of sparkling dust falls from them. Its large multifaceted eyes hold within their otherworldly beauty the spark of intelligence and reasoning.

Special Abilities

Adhesive Spray (Su) A night monarch can emit a spray of sticky, adhesive film once every 1d4 rounds. This creates a 30-foot cone of web-like strands that affect the area as per the spell web. Creatures in the area must make a DC 26 Reflex save to avoid becoming entangled. The strands last for 10 minutes before dissolving. The save is Constitution-based.

A night monarch can use this spray in the air. If a flying creature that relies on wings or similar appendages to fly fails its Reflex save it is prevented from flying and falls.

Blindsense (Ex) A night monarch notices and locates creatures within 60 feet. Opponents still have total concealment against a night monarch unless it can actually see them.

Dream Dust (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, the night monarch can flutter its wings and force the dust that clings to them to form a 30-foot-radius burst centered on the night monarch. This dust affects all creatures in the area as per the spell deep slumber but with no Hit Die limit. A DC 26 Will save negates this effect. Using dream dust is a standard action a night monarch can use at will. The save DC is Constitution-based.

No Breath (Ex) The night monarch does not breathe. This quality extends to any creatures that it touches or who ride on its back.

Poison Flesh (Ex) The flesh of a night monarch tastes sweet but contains a strong poison (ingested, Fortitude DC 26, initial 1 Con, secondary 1d8 Con). Any creature that succeeds on a bite attack against a night monarch ingests some of this poison. A creature that actively eats the flesh of a dead night monarch takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Touch Telepathy (Su) A night monarch can communicate via telepathy with any creature it touches.

Description

The night monarch serves the goddess Desna as her herald on Golarion. Although the par ticulars of its appearance differ every time it is sighted, its common form is that of a titanic moth or butterfly with a brightly colored, 40-foot wingspan that often reflects some aspect of the quest the goddess has willed it upon. In times of great need, the night monarch rises to protect Desna's faithful and combat the most egregious depredations of the Mother of Monsters, Lamashtu. Sighting the night monarch is thought to bring good luck and favorable dreams, which many hold to be visions from the goddess herself.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
