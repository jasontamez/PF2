Description

This brightly labeled bottle or
waterskin could appear to contain
any number of different beverages,
from absinthe to wine. However,
it's actually a magical trap, and
when the bottle is opened, a spider
swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 258) pours out. The swarm
stays in the area for 3 rounds, then disappears. Detecting that
the bottle is trapped requires a successful DC 25 Perception
check made by a character with the trapfinding ability, and
disabling it requires a successful DC 25 Disable Device check.
After being triggered, the trapped beverage remains a
mundane bottle or wineskin.
