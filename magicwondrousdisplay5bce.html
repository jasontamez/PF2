Description

These supple silk gloves are skintight. As a standard action, the wearer can deliver a complex secret message to a single target that can see the wearer as if she had succeeded at a DC 20 Bluff check. This message is conveyed in a series of rapid, complicated hand gestures that the target automatically understands. Creatures that see the wearer send a message can attempt a DC 20 Sense Motive check to notice that the wearer is delivering a secret message and decipher it.
