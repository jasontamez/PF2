This multi-armed creature is skilled at making attacks with multiple weapons.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, three or more hands.

Benefit:  Penalties for fighting with multiple weapons are reduced by -2 with the primary hand and by -6 with off hands.

Normal:  A creature without this feat takes a -6 penalty on attacks made with its primary hand and a -10 penalty on attacks made with all of its off hands. (It has one primary hand, and all the others are off hands.) See Two-Weapon Fighting in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook.

Special:  This feat replaces the Two-Weapon Fighting feat for creatures with more than two arms.
