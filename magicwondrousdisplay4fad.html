Description

This iron gargoyle face holds an iron ring in its mouth. Once
per day, when the flat back of the gargoyle face is placed
against a wall, floor, or ceiling, it fuses into place, creating
a usable door and penetrating the space beyond up to 1
foot as if using passwall. Speaking the command word
again ends the passwall effect, returns the surface to its
previous doorless shape, and releases the doorknocker from
the surface.
