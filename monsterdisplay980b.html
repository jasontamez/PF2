Smokeshade - Monsters







Smokeshade

This tube of roiling mist writhes through the air. Thin tendrils of dark smoke reach tentatively out from its body as swiftly as they collapse back into its central mass.

Special Abilities

Cloying Shade (Su) A smokeshade's tendrils deal negative energy damage. A creature that takes damage from a smokeshade's tendril attack is surrounded by a haze of cloying shadow for 1 round. This cloying shade imposes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and Perception skill checks and grants the target concealment from attacks made by opponents that are not adjacent to it. This ability does not give the target concealment against the smokeshade.

Hide in Plain Sight (Su) A smokeshade can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as it is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a smokeshade can hide itself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. A smokeshade can hide in the shadows of other creatures but not in its own shadow.

Misty Form (Ex) A smokeshade's body is composed of a semisolid black mist similar in consistency to thick foam. In addition to the incorporeal subtype, the smokeshade's misty form grants it the amorphous defensive ability. The creature cannot speak or make other sounds beyond a low rumble. Unlike a normal incorporeal creature, a smokeshade cannot enter water or other fluids, and it is always treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of how wind affects it, even if it increases in size.

Description

Capricious natives of the Plane of Shadow, smokeshades are amorphous creatures that are made from semisolid smoke and shadow. Thought naturally wormlike in shape, smokeshades can contort themselves into rings, corkscrews, or even crude effigies with little effort. Regardless of a smokeshade's shape, its composition remains purely a dark, roiling mist. Vain, preening creatures, smokeshades generally avoid combat and prefer to mock others with rude shapes or pantomime.

A spellcaster of at least 7th level with an alignment within one step of neutral evil who has the Improved Familiar feat can select a smokeshade as a familiar.
