Deities: Evil deities that offer the Water blessing or nonevil deities with disasters in their portfolios

Lasting Breath (minor): You can touch an ally to bless it with an extra reserve of breath. For 1 minute, while the ally holds its breath, standard and full-round actions don't decrease the number of rounds the ally can hold its breath (see page 445 of Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).

Tsunami Burst (major): At 10th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can invoke this blessing as an immediate action. A wave of water blasts out from you at your attacker, attempting a bull rush combat maneuver check using your CMB but adding your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength modifier.
