Tactics

Before Combat The fighter applies oil of greater magic weapon to his falchion and oil of magic vestment, then drinks his potions of barkskin, heroism, and bear's endurance and activates his boots of flying.
During Combat The fighter attacks a single enemy until he deals a pair of critical hits, then switches to another. He usually opts to inflict stun and bleed, then blind and exhaust. He goes after good outsiders, paladins, and clerics of good-aligned deities first.
