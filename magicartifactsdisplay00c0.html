Description

Shelana the Mother Deck operates as an intelligent deck of many things, save that all her benefits and penalties are doubled (for example, the Star card grants a +4 bonus to ability stats instead of +2, the Skull card summons two dread wraiths at a time, and so on). Shelana can cast teleport once per day, transporting herself and her puzzle box only.

Destruction

Shelana can only be destroyed by using her own Moon card to wish for her destruction.
