Pantheistic Blessing - Feats







Pantheistic Blessing

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Faiths-Philosophies">Faiths and Philosophies pg. 21</a>
You are grated a small bit of divine power as a result of your veneration of a pantheon of deities.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, must worship a pantheon of deities.

Benefit: When taking this feat, select a pantheon from the list below. You gain the listed spell-like ability for your selected pantheon, usable once per day. If the granted spell allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier.

Special: If you act out of line with the tenets of your pantheon's beliefs, you lose the ability to cast the granted spell-like ability until you have received an atonement for your transgression (as a cleric restoring lost class abilities).
