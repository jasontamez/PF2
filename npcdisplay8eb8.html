The dilettante developed magical abilities, but eventually decided to avoid both the arcane and divine paths.

Neberton the Wise

Neberton could have been a spellcaster, but felt it required too much work. Instead, he uses his natural talents for trickery and altering his appearance to acquire money and shelter-and get company for his bed. He isn't malicious, but feels no remorse for conning the rich and gullible.

Combat Encounters: Neberton avoids combat if at all possible. A duped ally might turn on him, a spurned lover may send a champion (such as a PC) to duel him, or he could whip a crowd of "believers" into a mob intent on protecting their "savior."

Roleplaying Suggestions: Neberton's talents make him a good "face" for a group of PCs lacking adequate diplomacy. His many schemes in various cities give him valuable information on high and low society, including the means to infiltrate exclusive parties or find the secret ins and outs of castles and mansions.
