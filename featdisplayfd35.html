Apotheosis (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Quests-Campaigns">Quests and Campaigns pg. 6</a>
You are marked by fate as a future deity-even before this
destiny is realized, fate bends to your will.

Prerequisites: You must have had direct contact with a
deity or godlike being, or have been risen from the dead
at the personal behest of a deity or godlike being.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Constitution checks to
stabilize while dying. Anytime you or an ally who worships
the god that contacted you casts augury or a similar effect,
your chance of receiving a meaningful reply is increased
by 5% (to a maximum of 95%).

Goal: You must be acknowledged by another divine
being (directly or through a representative) as a peer, even
if only a minor one.

Completion Benefit: Once per day as an immediate
action, you can cause any die roll made by a creature within
100 feet of you to be rerolled. You choose which result you
prefer. You must decide to use this ability after the first
roll is made but before the results are revealed by the GM.

Suggested Traits: Called, Fortunate, Inspiring.
