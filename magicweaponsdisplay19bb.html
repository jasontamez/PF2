Description

The blade of this +1 short sword appears to be nothing more than a shadow, but is quite solid and as sharp as steel. Five times per day, the wielder can as a move action create a featureless black "mask" of illusory cloth on the face of a willing target he touches. This mask obscures the wearer's identity and lasts for 10 minutes. Once per day, the wielder can activate the sword as a swift action; 1 minute afterward, the sword completely erases the wielder's memory of the previous minute (as if using modify memory).
