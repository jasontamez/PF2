When you perform an awesome throw, you knock opponents back farther.

Prerequisites: Str 25, <a href="featdisplay2dcb.html?ItemName=Awesome%20Throw">Awesome Throw</a>, <a href="featdisplaya186.html?ItemName=Greater%20Bull%20Rush">Greater Bull Rush</a>, Throw Anything or rock throwing, size Large or larger.

Benefit:  When you make an awesome throw combat maneuver, for every 5 by which your combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD, you send the target flying 5 additional feet. Furthermore, this movement provokes attacks of opportunity from your allies.
