Description

Developed by Al-Zabriti riders, a Qadiran saddle is sturdy but minimal, allowing horse and rider to communicate through slight muscle shifts and delicate balance adjustments. A Qadiran saddle gives a rider a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks, and it allows a rider to ignore the AC penalty from a charge when she is mounted and her mount charges.
