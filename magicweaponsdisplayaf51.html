Description

This +3 adamantine greatsword is designed with a single purpose: to bring swift death to those tried and found guilty before the law. When wielded in a coup de grace attempt against a helpless target, the executioner's hand is treated as a vorpal weapon, and if the attack is a critical threat, it is automatically confirmed as a critical hit.
