A <a href="magicwondrousdisplay91ca.html?FinalName=Pearl%20of%20Power1st">pearl of power</a> can be used only to regain a spell slot of a level you prepare, not to restore slots to your spell pool. Conversely, a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay6b85.html?FinalName=Runestone%20of%20Power1st">runestone of power</a> can allow the caster to cast a spell without expending a slot from his pool. The spell must be both of a level the runestone can restore and of a low enough level to be a part of his spell pool rather than a prepared spell.
