Pin Down (Combat)

You easily block enemy escapes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, fighter level 11th.

Benefit:  Whenever an opponent you threaten takes a 5-foot step or uses the withdraw action, that opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If the attack hits, you deal no damage, but the targeted creature is prevented from making the move action that granted a 5-foot step or the withdraw action and does not move.

When using this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points to gain its benefits and still deal damage with the attack of opportunity.
