Aspiring students of the Magaambya often spend decades researching arcane magic while learning to follow in the footsteps of the academy's founder, Old-Mage Jatembe. Those particularly gifted in the art of sculpting spells are sometimes schooled privately in the art of traditional, esoteric, and righteous spells, in the hope that such knowledge will pave the way for the initiate's acceptance into the school proper as a <a href="prestigeclassesdisplayafdc.html?ItemName=Magaambyan%20Arcanist">Magaambyan arcanist</a>.

But many initiates find themselves overwhelmed by the extensive training and end up leaving the Magaambya before completing their studies. These spellcasters retain many of the Magaambya's techniques and philosophical bents, but are not considered to be graduates of the school. Yet they are still respected and valued, for the Magaambya's staff fully understand that its teachings and the scholastic, often hermetic lifestyle required to master the techniques are not to everyone's tastes. For the teachers of the Magaambya, there are no truly failed students save those who abandon their philosophy and succumb to the lure of cruelty and evil.

Because they hold the Magaambya's interests close to their hearts but are not hindered by the need to remain close at hand to study or serve as teachers or assistants, Magaambyan initiates often serve as strong supporters beyond the normal reach of the Magaambya. Furthermore, Magaambyan initiates can act immediately against the forces of evil without waiting to be officially sent out into the world.

Alignment: A Magaambyan initiate must be of a good alignment.

This alters the arcanist's alignment.

Aura of Good (Ex): A Magaambyan arcanist radiates an aura of good as if she were a cleric of a level equal to her class level (see the <a href="spelldisplay0498.html?ItemName=detect%20good">detect good</a> spell).

Halcyon Spell Lore (Su): A Magaambyan initiate's studies of the philanthropic teachings of Old-Mage Jatembe allow her to cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she could normally prepare ahead of time. At each class level, she chooses one spell from the druid spell list or one spell with the good descriptor from the cleric spell list. The spell must be of a spell level that she can cast, and cannot be a spell that already appears on her arcanist spell list. A Magaambyan initiate can cast a spell that she has chosen with this ability as if it were on her spell list and prepared by expending a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to half the spell's level (minimum 1) and expending a spell slot of the spell's level. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Magaambyan initiate can choose to lose a spell that she has chosen with this ability in exchange for a new spell of the same spell level that meets the same requirements.

This ability replaces the arcanist exploits gained at 1st, 9th, and 17th levels.

Spell Mastery: At 5th level, a Magaambyan initiate gains <a href="featdisplaybc72.html?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery">Spell Mastery</a> as a bonus feat. Her arcanist levels count as wizard levels for the purpose of satisfying feat prerequisites, both when selecting this bonus feat and when selecting feats gained from character advancement. If she uses her arcanist level to satisfy the prerequisites for <a href="featdisplaybc72.html?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery">Spell Mastery</a>, she can prepare spells selected with this feat as arcanist spells without referring to a spellbook, but not as wizard spells. The Magaambyan initiate can also select <a href="featdisplaybc72.html?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery">Spell Mastery</a> as a feat gained from character advancement, allowing her to select the feat multiple times.

In addition, if the Magaambyan initiate gains levels in the Magaambyan arcanist prestige class (see page 118), her prestige class levels stack with her arcanist levels when determining the number of points in her arcane reservoir (though not the effectiveness of arcane exploits based on class level). A Magaambyan initiate who takes levels in Magaambyan arcanist and gains the spontaneous spell mastery class feature can use that ability to instantly lose one of her prepared spells and immediately prepare a different arcanist spell of the same level or lower that she has mastered with <a href="featdisplaybc72.html?ItemName=Spell%20Mastery">Spell Mastery</a>, rather than spontaneous spell mastery's normal effect. She is still limited to the same number of times per day she can use spontaneous spell mastery.

This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 5th level.
