The most conventional way to rid a victim of a curse is the spell <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a>, occasionally with the aid of other or more powerful magic. When making a new curse, especially one with a strong story background, consider novel ways to remove the curse beyond just casting a spell, as with the spell <a href="spelldisplay6a2b.html?ItemName=conditional%20curse">conditional curse</a>. Robbers might be cursed until they return every ill-gotten coin, while a haughty aristocrat might suffer until she cleans the feet of a dozen beggars. In these cases, it's best to make the victim vaguely aware of how to end his torment, but let him discover the specific details on his own through either research or trial and error. Curses with story-based remedies are often hard to break with <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> and <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a>. Increase the DC for removal by 2, 5, or even 10 based on the power of the curse. Particularly powerful curses resist <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> and <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> entirely, requiring either specific conditions for removal or the application of <a href="spelldisplay6497.html?ItemName=limited%20wish">limited wish</a>, <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a>, or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a>.

Some curses are easier to remove than normal; improvised curses, because of their impromptu nature, tend to be easier to remove. A simple cleansing ritual might suffice to remove them, which the PCs could discover through exploration, research, or a successful Knowledge (religion) check. Such curses could even fade over the course of days or weeks. While many NPC casters offer curse removal with no questions asked, it is common knowledge that curses are rarely picked up accidentally. Some of these casters might want to know the circumstances behind the curse (often employing Sense Motive or even divination magic during the discussion). Good-aligned churches might expect acts of atonement or charity as at least partial payment for removing a justly gained curse.
