Hurricane Punch (Combat)

Your fast strikes hit with the force of a hurricane, pushing your foes away.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay34d3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack.</a>

Benefit: When you hit the same creature with unarmed strikes at least twice in the same round, you can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that creature as a swift action. You can also move with the target even if you have no movement remaining, but the distance you move can't exceed half your speed.
