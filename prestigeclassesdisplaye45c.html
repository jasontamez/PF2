The Eldest appreciate a broad range of talents in their servants. While some of their faithful are traditional divine casters, many more are feysworn-adventurers of all sorts who pledge themselves to the service of one of the fey lords in exchange for magical power. Most common in the First World, feysworn can also be found on the Material Plane among those adventurers and scholars who deal with fey, were raised with a close connection to the First World, or simply appreciate the Eldest's willingness to exchange divine power for souls and service without the burden of excessive dogma.

The following are the class features of the feysworn prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A feysworn gains proficiency with all simple weapons and with her Eldest's favored weapon. She gains no additional proficiency with armor or shields.

Spells per Day or Spells Known: At the indicated levels, when a new feysworn level is gained, the character gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before taking the prestige class. She doesn't gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had levels in more than one spellcasting class before becoming a feysworn, she must choose to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.

Feymarked (Ex): Upon death, a feysworn is immediately resurrected and transported to a location on the First World sacred to the Eldest the feysworn worships (at the GM's discretion, the feysworn may be reincarnated instead). From that point forward, the character is held in her living state only by the Eldest's will. While the amount of service the Eldest demands in exchange varies, if at any point the Eldest becomes displeased enough to revoke this status, the feysworn is immediately and utterly destroyed, her soul energy permanently reabsorbed into the First World. Creatures slain in this manner cannot be resurrected short of deific intervention.

Feysworn creatures are immune to any spell not capable of targeting fey (such as dominate person, charm person, hold person, and any other spells specifically targeting humanoids). This immunity can be voluntarily suspended as per the rules for spell resistance.

Obedience (Ex): A feysworn must select one of the Eldest to worship; once this choice is made, it can't easily be changed . In order to keep the abilities granted by this prestige class (including augmented spellcasting abilities), a feysworn must conduct a daily obedience to her chosen Eldest (see Chapter 2).

Fey Boon: As a feysworn gains levels, she gains boons from her Eldest patron. The nature of the boons varies depending on the feysworn's chosen Eldest. Each Eldest grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the feysworn gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the Fey Obedience feat on page 17 and the Eldest descriptions in Chapter 2 for details on fey boons. When an Eldest grants a spell-like ability, the feysworn's level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a feysworn to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.

Breacher (Ex): At 2nd level, a feysworn gains a constant and instinctive sense of the direction (though not distance) to the nearest breach between the First World and the Material Plane.

Feyskinned (Ex): At 2nd level, a feysworn gains the ability to harden her skin, granting herself DR 10/cold iron for 1 minute per feysworn level each day. This duration need not be consecutive but must be used in 1-minute increments. At 7th level, this DR becomes constant. If the feysworn already has DR 10/cold iron or better, the damage reduction increases by 5.

Summon Fey (Sp): At 4th level, a feysworn can use summon monster IV once per day to conjure 1 ekekeh (see page 60) or satyr, 1d3 nuglub gremlins (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 143), or 1d4+1 fauns (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 114). At 8th level, the feysworn also gains the ability to use summon monster VIII once per day to conjure 1 bogeyman (Bestiary 3 42), 1d3 nuckelavees (Bestiary 3 203), or 1d4+1 escorites (see page 61). At the GM's discretion, specific Eldest may allow feysworn who worship them to summon other fey creatures of equal power with this ability.

Alien Mind (Ex): At 5th level, for a number of rounds per day equal to her feysworn level, the feysworn gains a +4 sacred bonus to one mental ability score and on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. These rounds do not need to be used consecutively. Once selected, the mental ability score affected cannot be changed until the feysworn next performs her Eldest's obedience. Activating or maintaining this ability is an immediate action.

Plane Swap (Sp): At 5th level, the feysworn gains the ability to transport herself and up to one touched willing creature per feysworn level from the Material Plane to the First World or vice versa. This ability can be used once per day as a standard action, and functions as plane shift.

Tear Reality (Sp): At 10th level, once per day as long as she is on the Material Plane or in the First World, the feysworn can rip the planar fabric to unleash terrible magical energies. The area of effect is always centered on her (though she may otherwise determine its shape or targets according to the spell's description) and chosen at random from the following spell effects. <table class="inner"><tr><td>d%</td><td>Spell</td></tr> <tr><td>1-17</td><td>Incendiary cloud</td></tr> <tr><td>18-34</td><td>Sunburst</td></tr> <tr><td>35-51</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr> <tr><td>52-68</td><td>Fire storm</td></tr> <tr><td>69-85</td><td>Storm of vengeance</td></tr> <tr><td>86-100</td><td>Reverse gravity</td></tr></table> Any level-based spell DCs and damage effects are based on the feysworn's total character level (not just her feysworn level). The feysworn herself is immune to the magical effects, but allied creatures are affected unless noted otherwise in the spell.

This ripping of the planar fabric opens a breach to a random location on either the First World or Material Plane, allowing travel between the planes. The breach remains open for 3d6 days before healing.

Ex-Feysworn

A feysworn who goes against the will of her Eldest loses all class features of this prestige class, including all spellcasting ability enhanced by this class (even if that spellcasting ability comes from a class that normally doesn't rely on the approval of a divine patron). She can't thereafter gain levels as a feysworn until she atones for her misdeeds (either through atonement or negotiation with one of the Eldest's chosen representatives), or until she appeals to and is accepted by another Eldest (symbolized by an atonement spell cast by a worshiper of that Eldest). This is the only method by which she can switch her Eldest patron, and even this may not be sufficient, as the Eldest are generally reluctant to take on unreliable servants.
