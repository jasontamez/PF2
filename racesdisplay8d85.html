Undine - Races







Mistsoul (Vapor Undine)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9z15?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-PlaneHopper-s-Handbook">Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 21</a>
Soothing and insightful, mistsoul undines move through the world with airy resilience and earnest action.

Typical Alignment NG
Ability Modifiers +2 Con, +2 Wis, -2 Int
Alternate Spell-Like Ability Mistsouls gain <a href="spelldisplay846a.html?ItemName=obscuring%20mist">obscuring mist</a> as a spell-like ability.
Mist Affinity This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base undine's water affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the dreamspun bloodline and spellcasters with the Repose domain.

With gentle spirits and contemplative minds, mistsouls are drawn to the more mystic aspects of their element. Their ephemeral, vaporous natures can allow them to lull others into a dreamlike state, or facilitate a peaceful transition into the next life. They tend to seek out places where ideological and political struggles converge, and thus they are at home in communities like those of the common folk of Brevoy.

Physically, mistsouls have rounded features and graceful deliberation in their movement. They prefer soft, highquality garments of neutral or earth tones and simple jewelry chosen for significance rather than expense.



Rimesoul (Frost Undine)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9z15?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-PlaneHopper-s-Handbook">Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 21</a>
Rimesoul undines are distant and imperious, aloof in their intellect and hesitant to change their ways.

Typical Alignment LN
Ability Modifiers +2 Dex, +2 Int, -2 Cha
Alternate Spell-Like Ability Rimesouls gain <a href="spelldisplay1e46.html?ItemName=chill%20touch">chill touch</a> as a spell-like ability.
Ice Affinity This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base undine's water affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the boreal bloodline and spellcasters with the Ice subdomain.

Like their ice-coated ancestors, rimesouls represent the solidification of change. They have precise, ordered minds that take well to individual pursuits. Rimesouls often choose to live in sparsely populated areas in Irrisen and Varisia. When they do live in cities, they prefer areas of disciplined culture such as Druma and Cheliax.

In appearance, rimesouls are frequently pale, sometimes with translucent or blue-tinged skin. Rimesouls usually dress in crisp, understated fashions that present an impression of austerity.



Undine Alternate Racial Trait

Replaces Darkvision

Deepsight
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 175</a>
The eyes of some undines are especially adapted to the lightless depths of the oceans, but not to air-filled environments. An undine with this racial trait has darkvision 120 feet when underwater, but otherwise has no darkvision at all. This racial trait replaces darkvision.


Replaces Energy Resistance

Flesh Chameleon
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 175</a>
Some undines can change their coloration to match human skin tones. As a standard action, an undine with this racial trait can change her natural blue hue to match any normal human skin tone, and can revert to normal as a free action. This grants a +4 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear human. This racial trait replaces energy resistance.

Terrain Chameleon
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 175</a>
Some undines can change their coloration to blend in with underwater terrain, mixing browns, grays, and greens to resemble kelp or other natural water plants. As a standard action, an undine with this racial trait can change her coloration, gaining a +4 bonus on Stealth checks in underwater environments. She can return to normal as a free action. This racial trait replaces energy resistance.

Water Sense
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 176</a>
Undines with this racial trait can sense vibrations in water, granting them blindsense 30 feet against creatures in contact with the same body of water. This racial trait replaces energy resistance.


Replaces Languages, Subtype, Type

Mostly Human
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 215</a>
A few ifrits, oreads, sulis, sylphs, and undines have appearances much closer to those of their human ancestors; in fact, they may not even realize their true race. Such geniekin appear to be human, save perhaps minor features like unusual eye color, and they count as humanoid (human) as well as outsider (native) for all purposes (such as humanoid-affecting spells such as charm person or enlarge person). These geniekin do not automatically gain their associated elemental language (but may select it as a bonus language if their Intelligence is high enough). This ability alters the geniekin's type, subtype, and languages.


Replaces Spell-Like Ability

Acid Breath
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 174</a>
Undines whose outsider heritage can be traced to a water mephit can wield acid as a weapon. Such an undine has a breath weapon that is a 5-foot cone of acidic water usable once per day. The breath deals 1d8 points of acid damage per two character levels (maximum 5d8). A Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the undine's level + the undine's Constitution modifier) halves the damage. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Amphibious
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 175</a>
Some undines are born with a permanent bond to water. Undines with this racial trait gain the aquatic subtype and amphibious special quality. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Nereid Fascination
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 175</a>
Some undines can trace their ancestry to nereids as well as to outsiders. Once per day as a standard action, such an undine can create a 20-foot-radius aura that causes humanoids within the aura's range to become fascinated with her for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the undine's character level (minimum 1). Targets may resist with a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the undine's level + the undine's Charisma modifier). This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Ooze Breath
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 175</a>
Some undines' outsider heritage can be traced to ooze mephits. These undines have a breath weapon that is a 5-foot cone of slime usable once per day. The slime deals 1d4 points of acid damage per two character levels (maximum 5d4) and sickens creatures in the area for 3 rounds. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the undine's level + the undine's Constitution modifier) halves the damage and negates the sickened effect. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Triton Magic
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 217</a>
Some undines-often from Outsea-descend from tritons, rather than genies. Undines with this racial trait can use summon nature's ally I as a spell-like ability, but only to summon a dolphin. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.


Replaces Water Affinity

Hydrated Vitality
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 175</a>
An undine with this racial trait gains fast healing 2 for 1 round anytime she submerges completely within a body of natural salt water, fresh water, or brackish water. Stagnant, poisoned, or trapped water (such as an artificial pit or a bag of holding) does not activate this ability. The undine can heal up to 2 hit points per level per day with this ability, after which it ceases to function. This racial trait replaces water affinity.
