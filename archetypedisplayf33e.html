Note from Nethys: This archetype was introduced in a section on Modern Firearms,  where guns were treated as the 'guns everywhere' mechanic. GMs may wish to read the appropriate section in Pathfinder #71 to see if this is suitable for their game.

Advances in technology have made archaic armors obsolete by the twentieth century, and modern soldiers concentrate training on firearms and swift feet.

Trench Warfare (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a trench fighter
can select one specific type of firearm (such as a machine
gun, revolver, or rifle). He gains a bonus equal to his
Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type
of firearm. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the
trench fighter picks up another type of firearm, gaining
these bonuses for those types as well. Furthermore, when
behind partial, normal, or improved cover, a trench fighter
gains an additional +2 AC bonus from the cover. This ability
replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.
