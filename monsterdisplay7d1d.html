Frosty Chiseler - Monsters







Frosty Chiseler

This twisted little gnome with white-blue skin and a wild, red-tinged beard snarls and prances madly about, clutching a hammer in one hand and a bloody chisel in the other. A closer look reveals its huge bushy beard is not made of hair, but of living scintillating icicles as sharp as dagger-points and frosted with blood-spray from its last kill. The beard dances as madly as he, wriggling like a nest of razored ice snakes undulating to their own sinister rhythm. One of the malingering degenerate's eyes is significantly larger than the other, pulsing and bloodshot, its pupil lolling about like a ship in a storm.

Special Abilities

Bristle Ice Beard (Su) A frosty chiseler's razorsharp ice-tined beard sprouts and juts wildly from his face and is nearly as large as he is. The vicious icy growth poses a serious threat to anyone attacking the fey in melee. An adjacent attacker must make a DC 16 Reflex save or take 1d4 points of slashing and 1d6 points of cold damage when she lands a blow against the chiseler, as his flailing oversized beard tears at her and flash freezes her flesh. The chiseler can break off sharp shards of his beard and hurl them at distant foes.

Brittlebones Curse (Su) Once per day, a frosty chiseler may target a foe within 30 feet and mutter "skin like ice, bones like glass, crack and snap and fractious smash!" The target must make a DC 14 Will save or be affected by a terrible curse that causes her to turn as brittle at delicate crystalline ice. If she takes more than a single move action each round she takes 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of Dexterity and 1 point of Strength damage as bits of her break off and she begins to fall to pieces. A DC 14 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the ability damage but must be made every round she exerts herself. In addition she takes double damage from bludgeoning and sonic attacks. The curse lasts for one day, but can be lifted by a remove curse or similar magic.

Frostwalker (Su) Frosty chiselers take no penalties to movement on ice, no matter how slippery, and cannot be forced to make Balance checks or Reflex saves to avoid falling on icy terrain. They may Climb icy surfaces as if under the effect of a spider climb spell.

Frosty Grasp (Su) A frosty chiseler's natural attacks, as well as any weapons he wields, deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage.

Description

Frosty chiselers were once master craftsmen and artisans of the fey. Either under the perverted sway of the Witch Queen or consigned to prolonged exile from the verdant lands of their people, these artists found themselves changed by a creeping cold that spread from their hearts to envelope their entire beings. Now they are demented perversions who delight only in evil acts. They still pride themselves as artists and craftsmen of unparalleled skill, but now their favorite medium is a blend of ice and mortal flesh rendered in frosty blood, pulped entrails, and scooped-out eyes.

Environment: Frosty chiselers infest the frozen hillsides on the outskirts of humanoid settlements or any other frigid locale where a steady stream of victims is available (an abandoned trading post in a well-traveled snowy mountain pass or a frozen river bed or lake where unsuspecting children frolic and skate the slick ice). A host of chiselers serve the Witch Queen in the still, blue recesses of her ice palace. There, they craft wonders and horrors beyond mortal comprehension out of blocks of ice and captive humanoids.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Frosty chiselers resemble deformed gnomes with wildly enormous beards of a thousand jutting icicles. One of their eyes is always larger than the other and peers from their head like a child's ball, riddled with bloodshot tracery. The average chiseler stands only three feet tall but weighs a hefty 100 pounds.
