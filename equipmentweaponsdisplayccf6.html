Description

This heavy crossbow has a winch mounted below the stock. Up to 50 feet of silk rope can be wound onto the winch as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The wound rope can be attached to a barbed bolt (see New Ammunition on page 19) or grappling bolt as part of a loading action. After firing such a bolt, the wielder can use the winch to retract the rope or pull herself along the rope if the bolt is secure. When used with a barbed bolt, the winch provides a +2 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks to pull the target toward you. When used with a grappling bolt, the winch provides a +2 bonus on Climb checks.
