Your affinity with the Shadow Plane allows you to draw a cloak of concealing gloom around you, even in bright light.

Prerequisites: Stealth 9 ranks, shadow blending racial trait or shadow call shadowdancer prestige class feature.

Benefit:  As a swift action, you can pull a haze of shadow around you, granting yourself concealment (20% miss chance) in bright light or normal light for 1 minute. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day when your character level reaches 12th, 15th, and 18th.
