You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefit of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. If you spend stamina points to raise an attack roll using the Combat Stamina feat's benefits, ignore an amount of your Combat Expertise penalty equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
