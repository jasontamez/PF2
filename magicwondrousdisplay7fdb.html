Description

This horn holds 20 doses of black powder for firearms. When
a firearm is loaded with black powder directly from this horn,
the horn creates a small pocket of air that envelops the gun and
allows that shot to be fired underwater or in an area lacking air,
such as a vacuum. Once the gun is loaded with powder from the
dry load powder horn, it retains the pocket of air for 10 minutes
or until the firearm is fired, whichever comes first.


Firing a firearm that has been loaded from this horn
underwater still incurs the -2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5
feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal
penalties to range. When a shot loaded from a dry load powder
horn results in a firearm explosion while underwater or in an
airless environment, that explosion occurs normally.
