Monsters with the expert array are the most adept with social options, though a charming swashbuckler (combatant) or an inspiring priest (spellcaster) could also benefit from one.

These abilities manipulate mental states to either hinder enemies or boost allies. Many of them are more applicable in combat than other social options.

Aura of Resistance: Choose two effect descriptors (such as fear or charm). Allies within 10 feet of the monster gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against effects with those descriptors.

Bolstering Presence: As a standard action, the monster emits an aura that extends from it in a 30-foot radius and lasts for 1 minute. Any allied creature in the aura gains a +2 bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks.

Demoralize Foes: As a full-round action, the monster can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet of it. When the monster reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points, it can use this ability as a free action.

Dread: As a standard action, the monster causes each creature it chooses within 30 feet of it to become shaken for 1 minute. This option doesn't cause a shaken creature to become frightened or frightened creature to become panicked.

Fascinate: As a standard action, the monster forces any number of creatures within 90 feet of it that can see, hear, and pay attention to it to make a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5). On a failure, a target becomes fascinated for 1 minute or until it sees someone make a hostile move such as drawing a sword or casting a spell. If successful, the target is immune to this ability for 24 hours.

Heroic Recovery: Once per day, the monster can grant itself and every ally within 60 feet an additional saving throw against one effect affecting it.

Inspire Competence: As a standard action, the monster grants a +5 competence bonus on skill checks using a particular skill to one ally within 30 feet of it that can hear it. The effect ends if the monster is killed, knocked unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to use a free action to continue the inspiration each round.

Inspire Courage: As a standard action, the monster grants a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects to every ally that can hear it. The bonuses increase to +2 at CR 4, +3 at CR 10, and +4 at CR 16. At CR 6, the monster can start this effect as a free action. The effect ends if the monster is killed, knocked unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to use a free action to continue the inspiration each round.

Inspire Fear: As a standard action, the monster forces each enemy creature within 30 feet of it that can hear it to attempt a Will saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes frightened and must flee from the monster's presence for 1 minute or until it can no longer hear the monster. If successful, the target becomes immune to this effect for 24 hours.

Inspire Heroics: As a standard action, the monster and one willing ally within 30 feet of it gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 minute. The effect ends if the monster is killed, knocked unconscious, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to use a free action to continue the inspiration each round.

Weakening Presence: The monster emits an aura that extends from it in a 30-foot radius. Any enemy creature in the aura takes a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, and skill checks. A target can attempt a Will save (DC = the monster's ability DC - 5) when it starts its turn in the aura. If successful, the target is immune to this aura's effect for 24 hours.

These options primarily factor into interactions other than combat. Most of them are good for creating adversaries who present a noncombat challenge or for quickly generating NPC allies with useful abilities.

Alertness: When attempting a Perception or Sense Motive check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Animal Talker: The monster can speak with animals, and gains Handle Animal as an additional master skill.

Knowledgeable: When attempting any Knowledge check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Liar: When attempting a Bluff, Disguise, or Stealth skill check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result. The monster's lies can't be detected by magic unless the one attempting to detect them succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 15 + the monster's CR).

Linguist: The monster speaks, reads, and understands all languages.

Mercantile Savvy: When attempting an Appraise check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result. In addition, the monster can attempt to identify magic items without casting <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a>, using Appraise instead of Spellcraft. If the monster fails, it can't attempt to identify the same item again.

Persuasive: When attempting a Charisma-based skill check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Slippery Mind: If the monster would be affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails its saving throw, it can repeat the saving throw attempt 1 round later.

Sound Mimicry: The monster can perfectly mimic sounds, and possibly voices. It gains Bluff as an additional master skill, and can attempt a Bluff check opposed by its targets' Sense Motive checks to mimic a sound convincingly. The target takes a -8 penalty if it's unfamiliar with the type of sound or creature being imitated.

Telepathy: The monster can mentally communicate with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.
