Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay24cf.html?ItemName=Beast%20Hunter">Beast Hunter</a>; base attack bonus +3; Knowledge (nature) or Survival 3 ranks.

Benefit: When fighting animals that are at least one size category larger than you and that are native to the terrain you have chosen with Beast Hunter, you gain a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks and a +4 to your CMD against such animals' attempts to use combat maneuvers against you. Additionally, you gain a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks by the animal that allow a Reflex save (such as attempting to avoid a trample attack).

Special: If you have selected Beast Hunter multiple times, you gain this benefit for all of the terrains you have chosen for those feats.
