Some occultists specialize in a particular panoply, fully dedicating themselves to mastering the secrets of the psychic resonance of each of its component implements, as well as the way they interact with one another.

Panoply Specialization: At 1st level, the panoply savant must choose (but doesn't learn how to use) a single panoply. When learning new implement schools, he must choose either schools associated with his chosen panoply or the chosen panoply itself. Once he has learned to use the chosen panoply, he can learn any further implement schools freely.

Panoply Focus (Su): At 4th level, a panoply savant gains 1 additional point of mental focus each day, which can be invested only in implements associated with his chosen panoply. At 8th level, and every 4 occultist levels thereafter, the number of additional points of mental focus he gains increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5 points at 20th level).

This ability replaces shift focus.

Implement Specialist (Su): At 8th level, a panoply savant learns to use his mastery over the implements in his chosen panoply to unlock greater power from magic items associated with that panoply. For a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier, when he uses a magic item that matches one of his chosen panoply's associated implements (crystal balls, robes, and wands for the mage's paraphernalia, for instance) and produces a spell effect, he can have the item use his caster level instead of its own. If the magic item doesn't produce a spell effect, the panoply savant can use his caster level against attempts to dispel that item. Additionally, if the item has any abilities that can be used at least three times per day or has three or more daily charges, the panoply savant can spend 1 minute quietly meditating on the item and expend 2 points of mental focus to restore one daily use or one charge to the item.

This ability replaces outside contact.

Panoptic Harmony (Su): At 8th level, a panoply savant can empower his abilities by harnessing the harmonic resonance between his chosen panoply's associated implements. Whenever he casts a spell or uses a focus power with one of his chosen panoply's associated implements, he treats it as though his caster level were 2 higher than it actually is, but only if on his previous turn, he cast a spell with or used a focus power from a different one of his chosen panoply's associated implements.

This ability replaces magic circles.

Panoptic Call (Su): At 12th level, a panoply savant's mastery over his chosen panoply's associated implements is so strong that he can call similar items to him. By taking a standard action and expending 1 point of mental focus from any of his chosen panoply's associated implements, he can cause a single item he can currently see that matches one of his chosen panoply's associated implements (such as a weapon or shield for the tools of the warrior) to fly through the air toward him at a rate of 30 feet per round, landing in his outstretched hand. If the item is unattended, the panoply savant automatically succeeds, but if it is held or worn, he must attempt a special disarm or steal combat maneuver check, using his occultist level as his base attack bonus and his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength modifier. If the item in question is an implement he currently has 1 or more points of focus invested in, he gains a bonus on this combat maneuver check equal to twice the amount of focus currently invested in it.

This ability replaces binding circles.

Combined Powers (Su): At 16th level, whenever a panoply savant uses a focus power from one of his chosen panoply's associated implements, he can expend 2 additional points of mental focus to also use a focus power from one of his chosen panoply's other associated implements as part of the same action. The second focus power must take the same amount of time or less to activate than the first focus power, and the panoply savant must expend the normal mental focus cost to use the second focus power.

This ability replaces fast circles.
