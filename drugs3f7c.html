Effect 12 hours; the user gains the ability to activate scrolls as if she had succeeded at a Use Magic Device check to activate a given scroll. Each time the user activates a scroll this way, she takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage and an amount of nonlethal damage equal to the scroll's caster level. Charisma damage taken this way is counted as ability damage caused by the drug for the purpose of calculating the DC of saving throws to resist addiction to the drug. Neither the Charisma damage nor the nonlethal damage can be healed until the user takes a full 8 hours of rest.
