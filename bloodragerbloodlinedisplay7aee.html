Bloodline Powers: The power of the Abyss courses through your veins, causing horrific transformations during your bloodrage.

Claws (Su): At 1st level, you grow claws while bloodraging. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d6 points of damage each (1d4 if you are Small) plus your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage resistance. At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At 12th level, these claws become flaming weapons, which deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a hit.

Demonic Bulk (Su): At 4th level, when entering a bloodrage, you can choose to grow one size category larger than your base size (as <a href="spelldisplay3f10.html?ItemName=enlarge%20person">enlarge person</a>) even if you aren't humanoid.

Demon Resistances (Su): At 8th level, you gain resistance 5 to acid, cold, and fire. At 16th level, these resistances increase to 10.

Abyssal Bloodrage (Su): At 12th level, the morale bonus to Strength granted by your bloodrage increases by 2, but the penalty to AC becomes -4 instead of -2. At 16th level, this bonus increases by 4 instead. At 20th level, it increases by 6 instead.

Demonic Aura (Su): At 16th level, when entering a bloodrage you can choose to exude an aura of fire. The aura is a 5-foot burst centered on you, and deals 2d6 + your Constitution modifier points of fire damage to creatures that end their turns within it.

Demonic Immunities (Su): At 20th level, you're immune to electricity and poison. You have this benefit constantly, even while not bloodraging.
