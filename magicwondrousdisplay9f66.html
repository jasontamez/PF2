Description

This thick leather belt is buckled with a bright bronze clasp
in the shape of a fist. When worn, it grants its wearer a
enhancement bonus to Strength and allows him to apply
his Strength modifier as a bonus on attack rolls instead
of his Dexterity modifier when making ranged attacks
with thrown weapons. Also, the range increment of any
weapon thrown by the wearer gains a foot bonus.
Treat this Strength bonus as a temporary ability bonus for
the first 24 hours the belt is worn.
