Description

Crisp and creamy white berries spill out from the interior of this starkly crimson, teardrop-shaped pepper. This eye-watering delicacy allows you to safely absorb heat and fire, though this reactivates the spicy taste. You gain fire resistance 10 for 1 hour. Any time this effect negates 10 or more points of fire damage, you must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 15 + fire damage taken) or be dazed for 1 round as the spices overwhelm your senses.
