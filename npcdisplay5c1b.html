Tactics

Before Combat The monk drinks potions of barkskin and cat's grace.
During Combat This monk prefers to use improvised weapons like ladders, tankards, and chisels. If he happens upon a particularly effective and sturdy improvised weapon, he applies oil of greater magic weapon before rejoining the fray. In familiar terrain, he tries to stun or trip a foe as a standard action and then uses his abundant step ability to seek cover where he can hide. The dwarf then pelts his adversaries with anything on hand.

Typically found among tavern brawlers, an improvised hurler turns ordinary objects into devastating weapons.

Creighton Flintfinger

As a child, Creighton hurled his cup at an older boy and knocked him out cold. From that point on, the world was his weapon. Each foe the dwarf faces is a puzzle-how can he win using only what is provided by nature and luck? He has been on this path for 20 years now, and is considered by many to be a living saint.

Combat Encounters: Creighton is friendly with many adventuring parties and city governments. He often travels as a group member, friend of a dignitary, or emissary, and comes to the aid of those who seem worthy.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Creighton is not like other dwarves. Tranquil in conversation, he is a riot of emotion in battle, as he tries to fuse with the world's primal nature.
