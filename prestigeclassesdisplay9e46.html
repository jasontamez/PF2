Many demon worshipers understand that sinful souls become demons once the Abyss digests them, but the demoniac simply cannot wait for death to begin her transformation. Depending on which demon lord a demoniac devotes herself to, her evil obedience, suite of powers, and resistance change. Yet in the end, all demoniacs are damned, their souls transformed by the Abyss into demons upon their deaths.

The following are class features of this prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A demoniac gains proficiency with all simple weapons and with her demonic patron's favored weapon.

Spells per Day/Spells Known: At the indicated levels, a demoniac gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a demoniac, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Damned (Ex): When a demoniac is killed, her soul is instantly claimed by the Abyss, to be transformed over time into a demon appropriate to the greatest sins the demoniac gloried in while she lived. A character attempting to resurrect a slain demoniac must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the demoniac's character level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the demoniac again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do so.

Demonic Mark (Ex): A demoniac bears the sign of her demon lord as a tattoo-like brand somewhere on her body. Once per day, a demoniac can call upon the profane magic of this mark to power a spell as she casts it. Doing so causes the spell to gain the chaotic and evil descriptors, and it causes the spell not be expended as it is cast, allowing the demoniac to cast the spell again at a later point in the day.

Obedience (Ex): In order to maintain her demoniac abilities (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by the class), a demoniac must indulge her chosen demon lord with a daily obedience. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the demoniac uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to a demon lord, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of demoniac, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her demonic patron. This choice determines which category of boons she earns as she gains levels, and once made, it cannot later be changed.

Energumen (Su): Once per day at 2nd level, a demoniac can open her soul to a demonic spirit as a free action. This demonic spirit possesses the demoniac for a number of rounds equal to her demoniac level, granting a +2 profane bonus to one ability score of the demoniac's choice.

At 5th level, energumen grants a +4 profane bonus to one ability score, electricity resistance 10, and a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison.

At 7th level, energumen grants a +6 profane bonus to one ability score and immunity to electricity and poison.

When the energumen ends, the demoniac becomes confused for a number of rounds equal to her demoniac level as the demonic spirit has its way with her mind. At the start of each round of confusion, the demoniac can attempt a DC 25 Will save to end the confusion effect immediately.

Energumen is a possession effect, and it is negated by protection from evil or protection from chaos. A demoniac can prevent or end the confusion side effect by using one of these spells, but being affected by such a spell before the energumen has run its course also causes the benefits granted to end prematurely.

Demonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su): As a demoniac gains levels, she gains boons from her demonic patron as her body and soul become increasingly infused with demonic energies. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the demoniac's chosen demon lord and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each demon lord grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the demoniac gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the demon lord and nascent demon lord descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a demonic boon grants a spell-like ability, the demoniac's caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a demoniac to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.

Summon Demon (Sp): Once per day at 4th level, a demoniac can cast summon monster VI to conjure one succubus, 1d3 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraksB6 to serve her. At 8th level, the demoniac also gains the ability to cast summon monster VIII once per day to conjure one hezrou, 1d3 vrocks, or 1d4+1 succubi to serve her.

Demonic Form (Su): At 10th level, a demoniac can undergo a temporary transformation into a unique demon as a standard action. Her type changes to outsider with the chaotic, demon, evil, and native subtypes. She gains damage reduction 10/good and cold iron, resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, and telepathy to a range of 100 feet. When she first gains this ability, she chooses to gain one additional physical transformation from the following when she transforms: wings (fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or a single natural attack (bite, claw, gore, slam, or tail sting; damage dealt as appropriate for the demoniac's size). Once this additional physical transformation is chosen, it can never be changed. The newly created demon's natural weapons and any weapon it wields are treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The demoniac can remain in this form for a number of minutes per day equal to her character level; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Returning to her normal form is a free action.
