Your paired blades rend through armor.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>, <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>, base attack bonus +1, Acrobatics 1 rank.

Benefit: Each time you make a full attack wielding a pair of daggers or a pair of kama and hit a creature with both weapons, you reduce its armor bonus to AC by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. This reduction stacks to a minimum armor bonus of +0. For example, if you hit a creature wearing a chain shirt with two primary attacks and two off-hand attacks, you would reduce its armor bonus to AC from +4 to +2.
