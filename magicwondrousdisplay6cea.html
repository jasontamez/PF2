Description

Fashioned from the salvaged mechanical "bones" of the first gearsmen that issued forth from Silver Mount, this gear-jointed, metal exoskeleton can be affixed to or removed from a suit of medium or heavy armor in 10 minutes. While attached, the enchanted frame bears some of the armor's burden, reducing the armor's check penalty by 2. In addition, three times per day, the wearer of a medium or heavy suit of armor attached to a steelbone frame can ignore the armor's reduction to his speed for 1 round.
