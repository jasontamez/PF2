Your draconic heritage manifests as divine power.


Prerequisites: Ability to spontaneously cast divine
spells, kobold.

Benefit:  You gain a +1 bonus to your caster level
when casting spells included in the dragon domain
or subdomains. Your spontaneous divine spellcasting
qualifies in place of arcane casting for the dragon disciple
prestige class, and you may increase spellcasting in your
spontaneous divine class as you progress in dragon
disciple levels. Add the bonus spells gained from the blood
of dragons ability to those you can cast as divine spells.
