The common perception of tengus as good luck charms has its roots in the first great empire to unify Tian Xia 7,000 years ago, when tengus were superstitious and skittish folk inhabiting the continent's central mountain ranges. Jinx witches specialize in calling down subtle misfortunes and deceiving enemies and allies alike. While they lack any ability to truly eliminate bad luck, they are uniquely gifted at making others believe otherwise. Many of these ancient traditions have been forgotten as tengus spread across the world and assimilated into other cultures, but a rare few tengus still practice this curious art of misdirection and dealing in ill fortune. A jinx witch's patron is normally Deception, Shadow, or Trickery.

Class Skills: A jinx witch adds Bluff, Disguise, and Sense Motive to her list of class skills.

This alters the witch's class skills.

Spell Awareness (Ex): A jinx witch is skilled at identifying hostile spells and effects that target her. She adds 1/2 her witch level to Spellcraft checks to identify spells being cast if she is targeted by the spell.

Jinx-Eating (Su): At 2nd level, a jinx witch learns to absorb (or "eat") antagonistic magical effects targeting her. If a jinx witch succeeds at a Will or Fortitude saving throw that negates a hostile spell effect, she can consume the spell energy as an immediate action. The witch treats her caster level as 1 higher when casting the next prepared spell she casts after eating a jinx in this manner. If the spell cast is of the same school as the eaten spell, the witch instead treats her caster level as 2 higher. A jinx witch can store only one eaten spell at a time, and can use this ability a number of times each day equal to 3 + her Intelligence modif ier. If the jinx witch uses this ability to eat a spell that targets more than one creature or that creates an area of effect, it uses 2 of her daily uses of the ability and all other targets or creatures in the area of effect receive a +2 bonus on their respective saving throws. If the jinx witch does not use the bonus provided by an eaten spell within 1 hour, the stored energy dissipates harmlessly.

This ability replaces the witch's hex normally gained at 2nd level.

Jinx-Gorging (Su): At 6th level, when the jinx witch applies a bonus from a spell consumed with her jinx-eating ability to a spell of the same school as the eaten spell, and of the same or lower spell level, she does not expend the prepared spell slot. She cannot affect the spell with metamagic or other effects that would change its effective spell level.

This ability replaces the hex normally gained at 6th level.

Jinx-Feast (Su): At 10th level, when the jinx witch uses her jinx-eating ability, she also gains the ability to cast the eaten spell as a spell-like ability, using her witch level as her caster level and her Intelligence modifier to determine the spell-like ability's saving throw DC. If the eaten spell is not on her spell list or is of a spell level higher than the witch is capable of casting herself, she must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order to cast it; failing this check results in the loss of the spell-like ability with no effect.

This ability replaces the major hex gained at 10th level.
