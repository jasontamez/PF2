When your blast kills a living creature, it helps shepherd the creature's soul to the Boneyard, warding against effects of spells that would attempt to restore the creature to life. Spellcasters attempting to bring the creature back from the dead using <a href="spelldisplay0d07.html?ItemName=raise%20dead">raise dead</a> or similar magic must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 11 + your kineticist level) or the spell fails and the material component is wasted.
