Your attacks with sticks have become blindingly fast, and you can throw in a combat maneuver between your attacks.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay567a.html?ItemName=Stick-Fighting%20Counter">Stick-Fighting Counter</a>, <a href="featdisplay02cf.html?ItemName=Stick-Fighting%20Style">Stick-Fighting Style</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit: When making a full attack using only clubs, a quarterstaff, dan bongs, saps, or tonfas, you can perform a combat maneuver as an extra attack using your full base attack bonus.
