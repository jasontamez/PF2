Description

Typically worn by jailers or executioners, this outfit includes a black woolen shirt, a tunic, pants, a belt, sturdy boots, a balaclava or hood, and a great cloak. This outfit is generally too intimidating and macabre to be worn in polite company. Some executioner's outfits prominently bear the symbol of the government or lawenforcing institution the wearer serves, while others are left ragged and stained to appear all the more threatening.
