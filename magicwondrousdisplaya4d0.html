Description

This tea set includes an array of utensils, painted with pictures of willows and flowers, used in traditional tea ceremonies: a small teapot, three bowls of various sizes and shapes, six cups, bamboo utensils (a ladle, a scoop, and a whisk), and several smaller containers, all stored in a wooden box. Once per day, a user can spend 1 hour performing a tea ceremony with the tea set. At the end of this time, the user must make a Diplomacy check. The tea used in the ceremony must be green tea of exceptional quality (worth a minimum of 10 gp per dose) or the user takes a -4 penalty on her Diplomacy roll to perform the ceremony. Up to six creatures (including the user) can drink the tea brewed during the ceremony. The tea's aroma arouses a sense of serenity in those who drink it, as they receive an impression of the sights, sounds, and smells of a blooming willow grove at sunset. The result of the user's Diplomacy check determines the effects of the tea on those who drink it. <ul><li>10 or less: No effect.</li><li>11-15: The drinker gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against poison and fear effects for 12 hours.</li><li>16-20: As above, and the drinker receives the benefits of neutralize poison and remove disease.</li><li>21-25: As above, and the drinker receives the benefits of heroism.</li><li>26 or more: As above, but the drinker receives the benefits of greater heroism instead of heroism.</li></ul>
