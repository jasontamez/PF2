Courtly Knight

Some cavaliers strive to be just as effective at the court of a local lord as on the field of battle. These courtly knights are equally at home in a duel with words or swords.

Social Presence (Ex): A courtly knight gains a +1 bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks. At 4th level and every 4 cavalier levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +6 at 20th level). A courtly knight starts any verbal duel with an extra edge she can use for only the presence tactic unless she is at a significant or extreme disadvantage in the duel.

This ability replaces tactician.

Imperious Attitude (Ex): At 9th level, a courtly knight develops a commanding demeanor, and the strength of her conviction is often enough to get others to do as she asks, merely because she expects it to be done. In a social setting, the courtly knight can attempt Diplomacy checks to make a request of a creature whose attitude toward her is unfriendly, provided that creature does not intend to harm or oppose the courtly knight or her allies in the immediate future. Further, whenever she attempts a Diplomacy check to make a request, a courtly knight can first attempt an Intimidate check (DC = 20 + the creature's Charisma modifier). If she succeeds, she gains a +5 bonus on the subsequent Diplomacy check. Neither aspect of imperious attitude applies if the requested creature considers itself to be of an equal or higher social rank than the courtly knight, which includes creatures that don't understand or value the concept of social ranks.

This ability replaces greater tactician.

Grand Boast (Ex): At 17th level, whenever a courtly knight uses her challenge class feature against an opponent who is at full health and under no negative afflictions, conditions, spells, or other effects, she can make a grand boast, declaring that she can defeat her foe with ease. She does not gain the benefits of her challenge (including any additional benefits granted by her order) when making a grand boast. If she successfully defeats the target of her challenge within 1 minute, however, she is vindicated in her boast and gains the benefits of her challenge against all allies of the defeated enemy who witnessed her grand boast and who are of the same or lower CR as the defeated enemy. If any of the courtly knight's allies attack the initial target of the challenge or assist the courtly knight after the boast, this ability has no effect.

This ability replaces master tactician.
