Description

This 1-inch steel cube bears a variety of unique, intricate carvings upon each face. On command, the cube sprouts wings and arms and becomes a Diminutive-sized, cube-shaped mechanical construct (treat as a <a href="monsterdisplayc98a.html?ItemName=Thrust">thrush</a> with hardness 10). The creature obeys and serves whoever activated the cube. It understands Common but cannot speak. The chirurgeon cube is skilled at healing constructs. As a standard action, the cube can use the magnets and small hooks embedded on its underside to attach itself to a construct and quickly stitch together any torn and broken pieces. This provides the construct with fast healing 2 for as long as the chirurgeon cube remains in contact with it. A chirurgeon cube can be activated for up to 10 minutes each day, spent in 1-minute increments. If the chirurgeon cube is broken or destroyed in either form, it is forever ruined.
