Simple and relatively clean, execution by guillotine proves as humane as it is grisly. But when the PCs need to prevent such an execution, the rules and timing become more important.

By the Rules: Traps like the <a href="trapsfad1.html?ItemName=Wall%20Scythe%20Trap">wall scythe</a> already provide rules for hurtling a significant mechanical blade at a hapless character. With the pillorylike restraint at the guillotine's bottom holding a character, the dropping blade essentially makes a strike against its victim's neck a <a href="rules51aa.html?Name=Helpless%20Defenders&amp;Category=Combat%20Modifiers">coup de grace</a>.

Extrapolation: One can easily treat a guillotine as a special kind of mechanical trap. Without the restraint, it might function exactly as a wall scythe trap. With the pillory, it becomes more deadly. Any creature in the pillory is considered helpless and so, the guillotine, when activated, makes a coup de grace attack against the victim-potentially causing death. If the guillotine strikes a killing blow, the victim is decapitated. If it fails, there has been some malfunction with the device, catching the blade part way through the pillory. A standard wooden pillory holds a character's head and both wrists. A character might slip free by spending 1 minute and succeeding at a DC 40 Escape Artist check.

Horror Considerations: A GM might use an even more <a href="magicartifactsdisplay65de.html?ItemName=Final%20Blade">horrific versions of the guillotinec in which the creature it killed has its soul trapped within the lethal blade</a>, preventing <a href="spelldisplayd65d.html?ItemName=resurrection">resurrection</a>.
