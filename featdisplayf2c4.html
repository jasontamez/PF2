You are accustomed to riding while wearing armor, and your armor doesn't hinder your riding skills.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat</a>, Ride 3 ranks.

Benefit: You don't take the usual armor check penalty on Ride checks. If you are knocked unconscious while in a saddle, you always remain in the saddle.

Normal: If you are knocked unconscious while riding, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (75% if you're in a military saddle).
