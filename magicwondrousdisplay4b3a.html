Description

These cloth shoulder straps have
many pebbles stitched into them. The
wearer of the straps can command
them to unfurl a pair of wings made
from a hard gray stone. These wings
grant her a fly speed of 60 feet and
average maneuverability. When these
wings are present her skin also takes
on a noticeable stone-like appearance and she gains DR 10/
adamantine. The wearer can furl and unfurl these wings as a
swift action. The wings can be used for up to 5 minutes each
day. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used
in 1-minute increments.
