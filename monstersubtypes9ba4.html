A behemoth is a neutral Colossal magical beast of great strength and power. Behemoths possess the following traits unless otherwise noted. <ul><li>Blindsense 60 feet. </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, aging, bleed, disease, energy drain, fire, mind-affecting effects, negative levels, paralysis, permanent wounds, petrification, poison, and polymorph. Some behemoths possess additional immunities. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex) No form of attack can suppress a behemoth's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If a behemoth fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported away as a means to save a region, but the only way to truly kill a behemoth is to use <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> to negate its regeneration (see below). </li><li>DR 15/epic. </li><li>SR equal to 11 + the behemoth's CR. </li><li>Behemoths understand Aklo, but cannot speak. </li><li>Behemoths eat, but do not breathe or sleep. </li><li>Ruinous (Su) A behemoth's natural attacks penetrate damage reduction as if they were epic and magic, and ignore up to 20 points of hardness on objects struck. As a swift action, whenever it strikes a creature or object with a spell effect in place, it can attempt to dispel one randomly determined spell effect on that creature as if with a <a href="spelldisplay0568.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic,%20greater">greater dispel magic</a> (CL 20th). </li><li>Unstoppable (Ex) If a behemoth starts its turn suffering from any or all of the following conditions, it recovers from them at the end of its turn: blind, confused, dazed, deafened, dazzled, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, slowed, staggered, and stunned. </li><li>Vulnerable to Miracles and Wishes (Su) A spell effect created by a <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell is particularly effective against a behemoth. A spellcaster gains a +6 bonus on its caster level check to penetrate a behemoth's SR with a <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell, and the behemoth suffers a -6 penalty on saves against these spells. A <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or a <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell can negate a behemoth's regeneration, but only for 1d4 rounds per casting.</li></ul>
