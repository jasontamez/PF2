Description

This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a
volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed
into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet,
floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it
breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects
only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.


If the dust is employed against an outsider with the elemental
and water subtypes, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude
save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the
creature even if its saving throw succeeds.
