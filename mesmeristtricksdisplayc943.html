Shadow Blend - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplayc943.html?ItemName=Shadow%20Blend">Shadow Blend</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 16</a>): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject attempts a Stealth check while in an area of dim or darker light. The subject gains total concealment from all enemies (50% miss chance) as long as it remains within areas of dim or darker light. Against creatures with darkvision, the subject gains concealment (20% miss chance) rather than total concealment. Once triggered, this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters an area of normal or brighter light.

This is a masterful trick.
