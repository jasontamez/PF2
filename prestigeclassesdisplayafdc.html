A Magaambyan arcanist studies and follows traditions of magic originally discovered by Old-Mage Jatembe himself, and uses these arcane secrets to continue Jatembe's quest to bring decency and integrity to civilization. Despite the name of the class, any arcane spellcaster can expand her powers via this prestige class, not only arcanists. Most Magaambyan arcanists consider their studies to be a sacred duty and a tradition that spans the ages. As a Magaambyan arcanist learns the deeper meanings locked within the academy's wisdom, she discovers the true enlightened and philanthropic purpose of the Magaambya.

Perhaps the most unusual facet of the Magaambyan arcanists' magical techniques is their method of interpreting and using magic of a druidic nature as arcane power. This unusual combination allows the Magaambyan arcanist incredible versatility in her studies, for the secrets of druidic magic are normally beyond the ken of arcane spellcasters. Yet the Magaambyan arcanist does not merely copy the magic of the natural world'she expands upon it. She simultaneously respects the traditions from which this magic stems while exploring it in ways that druids, who view their magic as a result of their faith, rarely consider. This method of converting druidic spells to arcane spells is taxing to the mind, however, and since each Magaambyan arcanist must create her own such translations, the school has not made arcane versions of druidic spells available to all arcane spellcasters. In fact, most students of the Magaambya are opposed to such an endeavor, for as intrigued as they are by this magic, they respect its traditions and do not wish to see these secrets made freely available to those who may not share their respect.

The following are class features of the Magaambyan arcanist prestige class.

Aura of Good (Ex): A Magaambyan arcanist radiates an aura of good as if she were a cleric of a level equal to her class level (see the detect good spell).

Halcyon Magic (Su): At each class level, a Magaambyan arcanist chooses a spell from the druid spell list and treats it as if it were on the spell list of one of her arcane spellcasting classes. A Magaambyan arcanist must choose a druid spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can currently cast. The spell's type becomes arcane and its save DC functions as normal for the arcane spellcasting class list she adds it to. The Magaambyan arcanist automatically learns this spell, adding it to her spellbook or familiar as appropriate for the class of the spell list to which she added the spell.

Superior Spell Mastery (Ex): At 2nd level, by spending a total of 24 hours studying over a maximum of 3 days, a Magaambyan arcanist can change the spells she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat. She can choose a number of spells she knows up to her Intelligence modifier (which can have a maximum combined spell level equal to or less than her caster level) to be her Spell Mastery spells in place of the same number of spells she previously selected for her Spell Mastery feat.

Virtuous Spells (Su): At 2nd level, a Magaambyan arcanist casts spells with the good descriptor at +1 caster level. To prepare a spell with the evil descriptor, she must use two spell slots of that spell level.

Intoned Recollection (Ex): At 3rd level, by performing a special ritual lasting 1 minute, a Magaambyan arcanist can prepare a spell into an open arcane spell slot. The open spell slot must have purposefully been left empty at the beginning of the day when the Magaambyan arcanist prepared her spells. She must be able to read her spellbook or have mastered the spell with the Spell Mastery feat to prepare it with this ability. She doesn't need to rest for 8 hours beforehand, but all other requirements of the preparation process still apply. At 9th level, she can do this as a full-round action, provided she has her spellbook in hand or has mastered the spell with the Spell Mastery feat. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier.

Lasting Goodness (Su): At 3rd level, all of a Magaambyan arcanist's spells with the good descriptor have their durations extended by a number of rounds equal to her class level. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent isn't affected by this ability.

Spontaneous Spell Mastery (Ex): At 4th level, a Magaambyan arcanist can lose any prepared spell to cast a spell of the same spell level or lower that she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 8th level.

Blessed Warding (Sp): At 5th level, a Magaambyan arcanist is under a constant protection from evil effect (CL equal to her class level). If this effect is dispelled, she can reactivate it as a swift action.

Immediate Spell Mastery (Sp): At 6th level, once per day, a Magaambyan arcanist can cast any spell she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat, even if she hasn't prepared it that day. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the Magaambyan arcanist, but can't be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.

Righteous Contravention (Su): At 7th level, a Magaambyan arcanist gains a +2 bonus on checks to overcome the spell resistance of evil creatures or evil objects, and on checks to dispel spells cast by evil creatures, spells with the evil descriptor, or evil magic items.

Holy Arcana (Ex): At 9th level, a Magaambyan arcanist expands her skill at translating divine magic into arcane spells. She adds all the bonus spells from the Good cleric domain to the spell list of one of her arcane spellcasting classes. These spells' type becomes arcane and the save DCs function as normal for the arcane spellcasting class list she adds them to.

Altruistic Guardian (Su): At 10th level, once per day when a spell or supernatural effect that allows spell resistance targets a Magaambyan arcanist's allies or if they are within its area of effect, as an immediate action she can redirect the effects to herself. She can do this for a number of allies up to her Intelligence modifier, provided they are within 30 feet of her. The Magaambyan arcanist must attempt the appropriate saving throws for each ally, possibly attempting multiple saving throws against the same spell or effect. She takes all damage and suffers all conditions and other effects that her allies would have taken, possibly taking these multiple times. This protects allies only from damage and conditions they-d take at the time she spends the immediate action, not from any they might later suffer from a noninstantaneous spell or effect.

Timeless Body (Ex): At 10th level, a Magaambyan arcanist no longer takes penalties for aging. This functions exactly like the druid ability of the same name.
