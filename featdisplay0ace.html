Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2075.html?ItemName=Greater%20Wild%20Empathy">Greater Wild Empathy</a>, Intimidate 5 ranks, Knowledge (nature) 5 ranks, wild empathy class feature.

Benefit: You add your Wisdom modifier on Intimidate checks against animals in addition to your Charisma modifier. An animal with 4 or fewer Hit Dice is frightened instead of shaken on a successful Intimidate check to demoralize it.
