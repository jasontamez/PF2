Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

These small, stylish golden clasps come in pairs: one for a handler and one for an agent. The handler's clasp provides constant information to the wearer as per the spell status regarding the wearer of the agent's clasp. At will, the wearer of either clasp can speak a command word to transmit a sending (as per the spell) to the wearer of the other clasp. If the other clasp is not worn, the sending is stored in the recipient clasp until it is next donned, at which time the message is delivered and the recipient has a chance to respond as normal.

The price and cost listed are for a matched pair of clasps.
