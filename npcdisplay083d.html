Tactics

Before Combat The monk prefers to challenge foes openly. He spends a point from his ki pool to increase his speed.
During Combat The monk uses Great Cleave and Lunge in tandem, normally spending a point from his ki pool to offset the Armor Class penalty of these two feats. The monk makes unarmed strikes, attempting to stun or stagger with Stunning Fist and then use Improved Bull Rush to push the enemy away. If overwhelmed, the monk drinks a potion of mirror image to confuse attackers, uses Spring Attack or Great Cleave to attack multiple opponents as a standard action, then moves away quickly. The monk always leaves 2 points in his ki pool so he can use abundant step if he's severely threatened.

Some elven monks master the art of carnage with one chosen weapon. Sword savants are particularly adept at keeping their foes at a distance until it's time to land the killing blow.

Ehtyar Nasta

No one wields a sword the way that Ehtyar Nasta does. His movements are like the wind, his thrusts like fire, and his parries like stone. One of the rare weapon masters of the age, Ehtyar uses his art to protect the world from the horrors that live beyond reality. He is especially wary of the machinations of the creatures of the Shadow Plane, and travels that plane pursuing one conspiracy or another. When not on a mission, he does fighting form demonstrations for the enlightenment and entertainment of the young.

Combat Encounters: Ehtyar is at his most tense when chasing creatures of the Shadow Plane. He's often paranoid of strangers, who he believes his enemies use to get close to him.

Roleplaying Suggestions: If he's in a place of safety, this elf is calm, helpful, and very generous with his time. When stressed, he is unyielding, overly cautious, and curt.
