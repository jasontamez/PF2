The tattooed mystics of Varisia are renowned throughout Avistan for both the artistry with which they adorn their bodies and the powerful magic they summon from these markings. Many learn the ways of tattooing from their forebears, the craft having been passed down through generations of Varisian wanderers and fortune-tellers. Others are born with what the Varisians call "birth tattoos"-incredibly elaborate and colorful birthmarks; those so blessed almost always grow up to become tattooed mystics. Regardless of how their fascination with the art begins, those seeking the powers of the tattooed mystic invariably turn to the runes of ancient Thassilon and the study of magic, combining the two into an elaborate and dangerous form of spellcraft.

The following are class features of the tattooed mystic prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A tattooed mystic gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.

Familiar Tattoo (Su): This ability is exactly like the tattooed sorcerer ability of the same name (Inner Sea Magic 40).

Mystic Tattoo (Su): A tattooed mystic inscribes ancient symbols of power on his skin to enhance his spellcasting. At 2nd level and every two levels thereafter, the mystic inscribes a new tattoo on his body, chosen from the list below. Mystic tattoos do not occupy magic item or tattoo slots on his body. The mystic can select each tattoo more than once; the effects of multiple tattoos are noted in their descriptions.

Binding Trine: This triangular design allows the mystic to transform a hostile spell affecting him into a magical tattoo, similar to a reservoir tattoo (Inner Sea Magic 16). When the mystic fails a saving throw against a spell of 3rd level or lower that targets only him, he gets a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If he succeeds at this check, he can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level as an immediate action to bind the spell, suppressing its effects and suspending its duration for a number of rounds equal to his level. Only spells with a duration longer than instantaneous can be bound this way, and only one spell can be held at a time. While bound, the spell can be dispelled or removed as normal. The maximum spell level this tattoo can bind increases by 2 each time it's selected, to a maximum of 9th level.

Blistering Bands: These glowing, angular markings encircle the mystic's arms. Whenever the mystic casts an evocation spell that deals energy damage, he can spend a swift action to surround himself with an aura of that same energy until the beginning of his next turn. Creatures adjacent to the mystic when he activates the ability or that end their turns adjacent to him take 1d6 points of damage of the same energy type as the evocation spell. If the spell deals more than one type of energy damage, the mystic must choose which of those types of damage his aura deals. Selecting this tattoo additional times increases the damage dealt by 2d6, to a maximum of 7d6.

Flickering Eye: The skin beneath this stylized eye seems partially translucent and insubstantial. When the mystic spends a standard action to concentrate on an ongoing illusion effect created by one of his spells, he gains concealment (20% miss chance) until the beginning of his next turn. Effects that negate invisibility negate this miss chance. When this tattoo is chosen a second time, the miss chance increases to 50%. When it's chosen a third time, the mystic instead becomes invisible, as per the spell invisibility, until the beginning of his next turn.

Pouncing Beasts: These bestial pictographs seem poised to leap off the mystic's skin. The mystic can cast summon monster and summon nature's ally spells of up to 3rd level as a standard action, rather than a full-round action, provided all the creatures summoned enter play adjacent to him. The maximum spell level the tattoo can affect increases by 2 each time it's selected, to a maximum of 9th level.

Rune of Fangs: These jagged runes cover the mystic's face, giving him a bestial expression. While polymorphed or otherwise transformed into a form with natural attacks, the mystic gains an enhancement bonus on his attack and damage rolls equal to 1/2 his level with one natural attack, chosen when he assumes that form. Each time he selects this tattoo, he can choose one additional natural attack to apply the bonus to.

Swallowing Glyph: This ornate, shadowy glyph absorbs the souls of those the mystic slays. Any time the mystic slays a creature with a necromancy spell, he can spend a swift action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell's level. Temporary hit points gained from subsequent uses of this ability do not stack. The second time this tattoo is selected, the number of temporary hit points increases to double the spell's level. The third time it's selected, the number increases to triple the spell's level.

Twisting Script: The indistinct shapes that form this spiral tattoo twist into legible text when scrutinized. Creatures within 30 feet of the mystic that can see him are affected by his language-dependent enchantment spells, even if they do not understand the language he speaks. Creatures without a language are immune to this effect. The range of the effect increases by 30 feet each time this tattoo is selected, to a maximum of 150 feet.

Magical Tattoo Artist: At 3rd level, a tattooed mystic gains Inscribe Magical Tattoo (Inner Sea Magic 16) as a bonus feat.

Skillful Tattooist (Ex): At 5th level, as long as a tattooed mystic is using his Craft (calligraphy, paintings, or tattoos) skill to craft magical tattoos on his own body, he can do so in half the time it would normally take (see page 91 of the Core Rulebook).

Tattoo Mastery (Ex): At 7th level, a tattooed mystic can use his own ability score modifier and relevant feats to set the DC for spell tattoos he crafts, and can use his own caster level if it is higher than that of the spell tattoo he is crafting (similar to a caster using a staff ).

Potent Tattoos (Ex): At 9th level, when a tattooed mystic uses his caster level to determine the DC of one the spell tattoos he has crafted, he does so at +1 caster level.
