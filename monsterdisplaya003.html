Chatterer Swarm - Monsters







Chatterer Swarm

A swarm of thumb-length, frog-shaped creatures rushes forth, each chattering madly in a different language. A mangy coat of black matted bristles covers their warty flesh while their oversized, bloated heads erupt into wide mouths filled with jagged teeth.

Special Abilities

Chatter (Su) Once a chatterer swarm burrows into its host, the swarm telepathically babbles insane commands in a dozen different languages. Horrifically, the host is compelled to bark the commands and statements aloud. In addition, the host's own thoughts are similarly broadcasted. As a result, the host babbles, whines, howls, and speaks in a choir of oft-contradictory voices. Each round, the voices compel the host to perform different actions, such as stick his fingers down his throat and force himself to vomit, gouge his own eyes, bite his flesh, or other semi-harmful and juvenile acts. The host can resist performing the acts with a Dc 20 Will save. A swarm that wins control of the host can also attempt to use the host's charged magic items.

Distraction (Ex) A creature that takes swarm damage must make a Dc 19 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save is constitution-based.

Flesh Burrow (Ex) A chatterer swarm that deals 15 or more points of damage to a single target (either in one round or a series of consecutive rounds) successfully gnaws its way into the victim's flesh and begins wreaking damage upon his mind and body. Each round the swam remains inside the victim's body, it deals 1d4 point of damage and can attempt to use its chatter ability.

Spell Vulnerability (Su) Certain powerful spells can remove a chatterer swarm from its host, however they must first overcome the demon's spell resistance (SR 16) to have any effect.

A remove disease spell cast on the host deals 4d6 points of damage to the swarm but leaves the host unharmed.

A dispel chaos or dispel evil spell cast on the host forces the swarm to succeed on a Will save or be immediately ejected from the host's body and appear in the nearest open squares.

A banishment, holy word, or similar spell has the normal chance to return the swarm to its home plane.

Description

These incessantly chattering tiny demons swarm their target and hungrily gnaw their way into the victim's flesh. There, they invade their host's thoughts with a barrage of suggestive prattle. While not unintelligent, they rarely agree with each other, and constantly argue over what actions to make their host perform. For this reason, they speak in different languages, hoping to better identify their individuality within the group.

Environment: In the Abyss, chatterers are almost powerless, and are pitifully collected and traded as amusing pets or devoured as snacks. At first opportunity, they hide in the pelts, feathers, and fat rolls of more powerful demons bound for the Material Plane, where they quickly join into swarms and seek to burrow into mortal flesh.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Chatterers are so tiny one might mistake them for some strange type of vermin. They are about 2 inches long, and possess wide  mouths filled with needle-like teeth. The creature's body is tiny, with stunted forearms and long, muscular hind-legs that end in webbed claws. Their torsos are oblong, slightly bloated, and covered with thick, bristling spines.
