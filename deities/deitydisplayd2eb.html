Obedience

Engage in a game of chance in which money, gems, or items worth at least 10 gp are at stake. This must be a wager that both parties enter into willingly. Offer a prayer out loud to Nivi Rhombodazzle before the wager begins (for example, if the wager involves dice, offer up the prayer before the dice are rolled). If you are alone and there is no one else to wager against, make a bet against yourself on Nivi's behalf, setting aside the stakes as an offering in the event that Nivi's side of the wager wins. Spend time privately reveling in the exciting thrill of making a risky wager and preparing yourself for the inevitable moment when the dice turn against you. Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Bluff and Sleight of Hand checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience. Once made, this choice can't be changed.

1: Gambler's Essentials (Sp) <a href="spelldisplay10d2.html?ItemName=true%20strike">true strike</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplaybb99.html?ItemName=augury">augury</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a> 1/day
2: Gambler's Egress (Sp) Nivi Rhombodazzle fled from angry creditors long ago, and her worshippers are encouraged to learn from her wisdom. Three times per day as a swift action, you can cast <a href="spelldisplaye099.html?ItemName=litany%20of%20escape">litany of escape</a> as a spell-like ability, targeting yourself or an ally.
3: Gambler's Prayer (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, you can offer up a quick prayer to Nivi Rhombodazzle that also serves as a wager with the demigoddess. Using this ability is similar to activating a <a href="magicrodsdisplay7cb7.html?FinalName=Rod%20of%20Wonder">rod of wonder</a>; choose a single target within 60 feet and then roll on the rod of wonder's Wondrous Effect table to learn the result of this ability. If you roll a result of 88-90, the gemstones that erupt are blessed by Nivi, dealing an additional amount of bludgeoning and piercing damage equal to your Charisma bonus on each successful strike.

Exalted

1: Faithful's Fortune (Sp) <a href="spelldisplayebed.html?ItemName=bless">bless</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay682d.html?ItemName=misdirection">misdirection</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay9a47.html?ItemName=heroism">heroism</a> 1/day
2: Gemstone Guardian (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a <a href="monsterdisplayf0d4.html?ItemName=Huge%20Earth%20Elemental">Huge earth elemental</a>. You gain telepathy with the earth elemental to a range of 100 feet. The earth elemental follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you have before vanishing back to the Plane of Earth. The earth elemental won't follow any commands that cause it to bring direct harm to a gnome or svirfneblin, though it can be commanded to grapple or restrain such a creature.
3: Seven-Pipped Gem (Su) As an immediate action, you can gain a luck bonus on a single d20 roll equal to half your total Hit Dice (minimum 1). You can use this ability after you have rolled, but must declare the use of this ability before you know the result of the check. If this roll is made as part of a Sleight of Hand check or game of chance, the luck bonus is instead equal to your total Hit Dice. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1). Once you have used all of your daily uses of this ability, you can attempt to use this ability one additional time, but there is a 50% chance that instead of gaining a luck bonus on the roll, you instead take a penalty equal to the bonus you would have received.

Sentinel

1: Communal Combatant (Sp) <a href="spelldisplayca3a.html?ItemName=divine%20favor">divine favor</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay2215.html?ItemName=shield%20other">shield other</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay4b88.html?ItemName=prayer">prayer</a> 1/day
2: Stone Strikes (Ex) Once per round when you deal damage to an opponent with a weapon from the <a href="_fighterweapons.html">hammers weapon group</a> or any weapon with "gnome" in its name, you can attempt a sunder combat maneuver check as a free action against any weapon or armor the target of the attack is wielding or wearing. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You gain a +2 competence bonus on your combat maneuver check for each size category larger than you the target is.
3: Strength of the Earth (Ex) You gain the ability to enter a <a href="prestigeclassesdisplay72ca.html?ItemName=Stalwart%20Defender">defensive stance, as per the stalwart defender class feature</a>, treating your sentinel levels as stalwart defender levels when determining the total number of rounds you can use this ability each day. While in a defensive stance, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. While you are fatigued from using this ability, you can also use your stone strikes ability whenever a creature damages you with a melee attack, though you can still use stone strikes only once per round.
