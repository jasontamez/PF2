Obedience

Spend an hour meditating on something you've learned and whispering hypotheses and possibilities based upon that fact. Additionally, once per week, you must perform an act you've never done before and that society holds as taboo-usually involving eating or drinking something unsavory. You can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve any illusion you come within 10 feet of, and you gain a +4 bonus on Will saving throws to disbelieve illusions.

1: Taboo Breaker (Sp) remove fear 3/day, touch of idiocy 2/day, or water breathing 1/day
2: Heresy Speaker (Su) Once per day, you can speak an incredible heresy. This functions as per dictum, but affects even creatures of lawful alignment. You can choose what creatures to exclude from this ability's effects.
3: Poison Tongue (Su) Your words become poison. As a standard action, while you're speaking, you can choose to poison any number of creatures that can hear your voice. The creatures must each succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your Charisma modifier + your Hit Dice) or be affected with muddling heresy (see the sidebar) with a frequency of 1/round for 2 rounds. You can attempt to poison any number of creatures per day equal to your Hit Dice. There is no evidence that your words are magical or envenomed, causing the venom to have no obvious source.

1: Serpent Blood (Sp) reduce person 3/day, acid arrow 2/day, or beast shape III (reptiles only) 1/day
2: Venom Maw (Su) As an immediate action, you can cause your mouth to widen and grow a pair of long, venomous fangs. You gain a bite attack for 1 round. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d8 points of piercing damage if you're Medium or 1d6 points of damage if you're Small. Any creature damaged by your attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + your Wisdom modifier + half your Hit Dice) or be affected by muddling heresy (see the sidebar). Additionally, once per hour, you can spit a stream of venom up to 30 feet. Any creature struck by this ranged attack must save against your poison as if it had been bitten.
3: Divine Insult (Su) A number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus, you can speak a specialized blasphemy against a single target. As a standard action, you shout shocking truths at the target. The target is affected as per heretic's tongue (see page 72). If you successfully deny a divine spellcaster access to its class abilities, that target must succeed at a second saving throw at the end of the spell's effect, whether shortened or not (DC = 10 + your Wisdom modifier + half your Hit Dice). If the target fails, its abilities do not return until it receives the benefits of an atonement spell.

1: Stygian Sentinel (Sp) summon nature's ally I 3/day, bear's endurance 2/day, or water breathing 1/day
2: Chain Coil (Su) When you successfully disarm an opponent using a heavy flail, your disarmed opponent immediately provokes an attack of opportunity from you. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on any attacks of opportunity you make against opponents you have disarmed with a heavy flail within the last round. Additionally, the critical threat range of any heavy flail you wield increases by 1 (this increase stacks with that from the Improved Critical feat).
3: Coffin Feast (Su) Once per day, you can touch the corpse of a humanoid creature, affecting it as though it were the food and drink created by the spell heroes' feast. The appearance of the corpse doesn't change, but it miraculously provides enough sustenance to feed a number of creatures equal to your Hit Dice. Creatures that eat from this communal table, a process that takes 1 hour, gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls and Will saving throws instead of the usual +1 morale bonus. It also provides those who eat from the corpse with the benefits of the spell regenerate.

1: Stygia's Secrets (Sp) fumbletongue  3/day, augury 2/day, or illusory script 1/day
2: Truths and Lies Overwhelming (Sp) Once per day, you can cast dictum as a spell-like ability.
3: Whispers of Ihyssige (Su) Although you find Stygia's ominous white stone monolith of Ihyssige a mystery, you know that a mere glimpse of the truth behind the obelisk can drive a mortal insane. Once per day as a standard action, you can target one or more living creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 feet apart. Each creature who fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) is affected as if by an insanity spell. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

1: Sound the Horn (Sp) forbid action  3/day, hideous laughter 2/day, or blood biography 1/day
2: Geryon's Torpor (Su) Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes meditating on the unholy might of the heresies Geryon sows in the hearts of all. You must remain quiet and undisturbed during this time, and you can't take any other actions while thus meditating. During the 24 hours following your meditation, you can grant yourself and up to four other creatures within 30 feet a +4 profane bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks as a move action. You can maintain these bonuses as a free action for up to 1 round per Hit Die, after which you must meditate again to regain the ability. These rounds need not be consecutive, but the duration must be used in 1-round increments. You can deactivate the bonuses as a free action. Performing your obedience to Geryon does not count toward the meditation time this ability requires.
3: Trophies of the Betrayer (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, you can target any creature within 60 feet and whisper lies directly into its mind. If the target fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), it has a temporary crisis of faith, and it cannot access any abilities granted to it by its faith, including the ability to cast spells. This effect has no lasting effect on a creature's faith, and when the effect ends, the target returns to normal. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. This is a mind-affecting effect but is not language-dependent, as the lies you weave are understood regardless of the languages the target speaks.

1: Ophidian Kiss (Sp) disguise weapon  3/day, animal trance 2/day or greater magic fang 1/day
2: Crushing Coils (Sp) Although it is often contemplative, the Serpent relishes visiting a hellish and mighty wrath upon those liars and sinners who have earned its ire, particularly the damned souls that writhe in the swamps of Stygia. As its worshiper, you are more than happy to further Geryon's dark work. Once per day, you can cast vortex as spell-like ability.
3: Three-Headed Serpent (Su) For a number of minutes equal to your Hit Dice, you become a Large version of yourself, with powerful coils sprouting in place of your feet. This increases your base speed by 30 feet. Additionally, you can use your coils to form a cage for your enemies. When you successfully grapple a creature, you can transfer that creature into your coils; this works like the swallow whole universal monster ability. Your coils have AC 17 and 18 hp when an entrapped creature attempts to cut itself free. Your coils heal quickly while this ability is in effect, allowing you to transfer another (or the same) creature into your coils 1 round after a creature cuts itself free. Activating three-headed serpent is a standard action, and dismissing it is a free action. This effect's duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.
