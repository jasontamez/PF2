2: Issue Judgment (Sp) Once per day, you can issue a judgment on a crime whose testimony and evidence you have either personally witnessed or studied for at least 1 hour. If you find the target guilty, you can cast <a href="spelldisplay70b0.html?ItemName=curse,%20major">major curse</a> on that creature as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice. The condition to remove the curse must relate directly to making amends or growing beyond the criminal behavior.
3: Collective Knowledge (Su) Whenever you are among a culture, you gain a +5 insight bonus on Knowledge checks to intuitively understand local customs, etiquette, history, lore, and magic of that particular culture, and you can attempt such Knowledge checks untrained. For the purposes of this power, a "culture" is any particular group of at least 100 people within 5 miles of each other who share a common ethnicity, language, or race, and you are considered among the culture when you are no more than 1 mile away from anyone in this particular group.
