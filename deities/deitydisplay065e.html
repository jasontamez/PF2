1: Verdict (Sp) command 3/day, enthrall 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Olheon's Judgment (Sp) Once per day, you can place a symbol on a target who has shirked his obligations or showed poor judgment in his official capacity; that symbol acts similarly to a mark of justice. This spell-like ability has a casting time of 1 round instead of 10 minutes, and when the mark activates it causes the target to take a -6 penalty to Wisdom and Charisma. The conditions you place on the mark must relate to the target's actions as a leader.
3: Lordship (Su) You automatically gain the Leadership feat, and you are always considered to have a reputation of fairness and generosity so long as you maintain your allegiance to Olheon. If you already have the Leadership feat, you gain an additional +2 bonus to your Leadership score. You may choose to attract a hound or legion archon as a cohort. Your archon cohort gains additional HD to bring its total HD to 2 lower than your own level.
