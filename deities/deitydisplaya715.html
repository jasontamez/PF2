Obedience

While reciting formulas from Logic of Design, you must craft a new creation, continue work on an elaborate device or object, or disassemble an existing creation to see how it works. Favored projects among the church include useful gear, magic items, innovative toys, and contraptions invented primarily to see if they would work rather than to solve a specific problem. Share the knowledge you discover while working on this project. If no people are around to hear or read your observations, or you are incapable of communicating with anyone, instead write down notes about your work to publish or otherwise share with others later. If you can share these notes with someone but choose not to, your obedience is unfulfilled; the requirement to share a set of these notes needs only be met once for that set of notes. You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Disable Device checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

1: Voice of Bronze (Sp) jury rig 3/day, fox's cunning 2/day, sands of time 1/day
2: Living Construct (Su) The Whisper in the Bronze is the patron of constructs, and through the teachings of her faith, you have learned how to sense the animating spirits within such mechanical entities. You can affect constructs with magic as if they were living creatures. Once per day, you can target a construct with a spell or spell-like ability, and the spell resolves as if the construct's creature type were humanoid. This can bypass intelligent constructs' immunity to mind-affecting effects, but mindless constructs remain unaffected.
3: Time Bounce (Sp) Time is simply a construct, and as such, it can be understood and manipulated. You gain the ability to perceive the flow of time and alter it around yourself, giving you the ability to bounce through time-space from one place to another. Once per day, you can use dimensional bounce as a spell-like ability.

Exalted

1: Creator (Sp) crafter's fortune 3/day, make whole 2/day, minor creation 1/day
2: Protected by the Machine (Su) Your body gains a bit of the resistance of a construct, perhaps appearing as bronze plates shielding vital organs or bronze gears on your limbs to help push them past their limits, much as Brigh's own clockwork armor is said to change form to suit her needs. You gain a +2 sacred or profane bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on saving throws against effects that cause ability damage, ability drain, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, or nonlethal damage.
3: Inspired Crafting (Su) The quest for discovery and innovation never stops. By applying Brigh's deep insights into efficient time management and technical innovation, you can craft items in spare moments squeezed in while adventuring or otherwise serving your god's ideals. When crafting magic items while adventuring, you can devote 4 hours each day to creation and take advantage of the full amount of time spent crafting instead of netting only 2 hours' worth of work. In addition, you can use fabricate once per day as a spell-like ability. Although you can't create magic items with the fabricate spell, you can use it to create items that you later enhance magically.

1: Bronze Warrior (Sp) crafter's curse 3/day, heat metal 2/day, haste 1/day
2: Constructed Form (Su) Brigh is fond of adjusting, adding, and removing devices from her internal mechanical workings to constantly improve her design, and she blesses you with a trace of this ability. As a swift action, you can alter your body to incorporate construct-like features that protect you from physical damage. The transformation is subtle, such as adding metal reinforcements along your bones or small, auxiliary clockwork counterparts to your vital organs. The transformation grants you DR 3/- and lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice. These rounds need not be consecutive. Dismissing the effect is a free action.
3: Call to Battle (Su) Brigh's mechanical servants answer your call to defend inventions, innocent constructs, and the victims of misguided inventions. Once per day as a full-round action, you can summon a clockwork golem (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 137). It has the extraplanar subtype but is otherwise a typical golem of its kind. The golem follows your commands perfectly for 1 round per Hit Die you possess before vanishing.
