Obedience

Dance in a random pattern beneath the light of the stars, trusting in the guidance of destiny. If no stars are currently visible, softly sing or chant all of the names of stars that you know as you perform your dance. Let your mind expand and turn your thoughts away from where your feet might land, allowing your steps to fall where chance wills. When the dance feels complete, cease dancing. Ponder the steps you took and the position in which you stopped, and consider what portents these subtle clues might hold for the future. Gain a +1 luck bonus on initiative checks and a +4 sacred bonus on Perception checks made to determine whether you are aware of opponents just before a surprise round.

Divine Gift

Nethys Note: See <a href="rulese221.html?Name=Divine%20Gifts&amp;Category=Role%20of%20the%20Divine">here</a> for details on how to gain a Divine Gift
The character gains 20 luck points that can be spent at any time as a free action to increase the rolled result of a single d20 roll on a one-to-one basis. This ability can be used as many times as the character wishes as long as she retains luck points to spend, but only once per roll. These luck points can be spent after the result of the roll is determined, but must be spent immediately or the opportunity to adjust the luck of that roll is lost.

1: Traveler's Tricks (Sp) longstrider 3/day, darkvision 2/day, or phantom steed 1/day
2: Starlit Caster (Su) Over time you have learned to focus your magical power to better damage agents of evil. You add your Charisma bonus on your concentration checks, as well as on your caster level checks to overcome spell resistance. In addition, when you stand in starlight and cast a spell that deals hit point damage, you can have it deal an extra 2d6 points of damage. This bonus damage is untyped, and manifests as a glowing aura of starlight around the spell's original effect.
3: Starry Eyes (Su) You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision with a range of 60 feet or greater, the range of your darkvision instead increases by 10 feet. This extension applies only to natural, permanent darkvision, not to darkvision that is granted by spells or other effects. In addition, while you stand in starlight the range of your spells (other than spells with the range of "personal" or "touch") increases as though your caster level were 1 level higher.

Exalted

1: Slumberer (Sp) sleep 3/day, silence 2/day, or deep slumber 1/day
2: Splendorous Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a lillend azata. You gain telepathy with the lillend to a range of 100 feet. The lillend follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home on Elysium. The lillend doesn't follow any commands that would cause it to take evil or overly lawful actions, and the creature could even attack you if the command is particularly egregious.
3: Blast of Motes (Su) Whenever you channel positive energy to heal living creatures, a shower of starry motes cascades over all of the living creatures in the area of effect. These motes do not impede vision or stealth attempts, nor do they reveal invisible creatures, but they infuse the targets with divine luck. Targets of this ability reduce any miss chance they face by 10%. In addition, when targets of this ability roll damage dice, they may treat all 1s as 2s. The motes and their effects last for 1 round + 1 round for every 4 Hit Dice you have (maximum 6 rounds). If you don't have the ability to channel positive energy, you gain the ability to do so once per day as a cleric of a level equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20), but only to heal living creatures. Whenever you use this ability, the beneficiaries are showered with starry motes, with the effects described above.

Sentinel

1: Fighting Chance (Sp) entropic shield 3/day, blur 2/day, or displacement 1/day
2: See through Dreams (Su) Desna's blessing allows you to see through half-real and fantastical images. You gain a +1 luck bonus on saving throws made against illusion spells and effects and against dream-based magic (such as nightmare). This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum +6).
3: Shooting Star (Ex) You can throw your deity's star-shaped favored weapon with great speed and ease. Three times per day, you can make a single ranged attack with a starknife as a swift action. To throw a starknife as a swift action, you must have it in hand, have sufficient actions available to draw the starknife, or have the Quick Draw feat or a similar ability.

Divine Fighting Technique



Desna's Shooting Star

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 28</a>
Among the divine fighting manuals of the Inner Sea, few are as ancient as Clamor of the Spheres, a collection of fighting techniques favored by Desna's faithful. True to its name, the manual focuses on interpreting the chaos and sounds of combat, but nevertheless provides insightful and downright brilliant methods of defense with Desna's favored weapon, using techniques that treat a fight with a starknife more as a beautiful dance than a battle.

Optional Replacement: A chaotic good bard of at least 2nd level who worships Desna can replace a versatile performance with the following initial benefit.

Initial Benefit: You can add your Charisma bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls when wielding a starknife. If you do so, you don't modify attack rolls and damage rolls with your starknife with your Strength modifier, your Dexterity modifier (if you have Weapon Finesse), or any other ability score (if you have an ability that allows you to modify attack rolls and damage rolls with that ability score).

Advanced Prerequisites: Dex 17; Divine Fighting Technique; Point-Blank Shot; Rapid Shot; base attack bonus +11 or Sleight of Hand 11 ranks.

Optional Replacement: A chaotic good bard of at least 10th level who worships Desna can replace a versatile performance with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.

Advanced Benefit: You can impart a powerful spin to a thrown starknife so that multiple blades strike the target rather than just a single blade of the four, dealing extra damage with the other blades. As a full-round action, you can make a single attack with a thrown starknife, rolling 1d4 to determine how many effective strikes you gain with the attack (if you roll a 1, then only one blade strikes). If the attack hits, all of the effective strikes damage the target. Apply precision-based damage (such as sneak attack damage) and critical hit damage only once for this attack. The damage bonus from your appropriate ability score modifier applies to each strike, as do other damage bonuses, such as a bard's inspire competence bonus. Damage reduction and resistances apply separately to each strike.
