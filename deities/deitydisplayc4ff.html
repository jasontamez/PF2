Obedience

Place a gold coin in the middle of a busy street and spy on it from a hidden position. If someone picks up the coin, you must silently follow that person for 1 hour. At the end of that hour, judge that person's social standing. If the person is fortunate or wealthy, steal the coin back. If the person is destitute or downtrodden, let him keep the coin and offer a silent prayer to Thamir Gixx on his behalf. If no one picks up the coin after an hour, you must dispose of the coin in a way no one might ever find it, such as by throwing it into the sea or burying it in a hidden location. You gain a +2 profane bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks.

2: Hidden in Darkness (Su) You can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as you are within an area of dim light or darker, you can hide yourself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. You can't, however, hide in your own shadow, and you can't use this ability to hide from creatures that have darkvision or have the see in darkness supernatural ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 301).
3: Feed on Shadows (Su) Whenever you are in an area of dim light or darker, you can, as a standard action, regain a number of hit points equal to 4d8 + 1 per character level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

2: Shadow Twin (Su) As a standard action, you can create a quasi-real duplicate of yourself using material from the Plane of Shadow. The double appears in a square adjacent to you. Your foes are unable to tell the two of you apart, but a foe that succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 +1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier) upon interacting with your double identifies the double as an illusion. Your double has your Armor Class and saving throws and 20% of your maximum hit points. As a move action, you can direct your double to move at your speed and to talk and gesture as if it were real for 1 round; it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so. If you do not direct your double, it stands still, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on any saving throw to disbelieve it that round. Your double provides flanking against foes that haven't identified it as an illusion, even when standing still. Your double lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but you can only have one double in existence at a time.
3: Quiet of the Grave (Su) Three times per day, you can create a 20-foot-radius emanation of complete silence centered on yourself (as per the <a href="spelldisplay672f.html?ItemName=silence">silence</a> spell) that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level. When a creature is reduced to -1 or fewer hit points while within this radius of silence, but is still alive, you can attempt to kill it as an immediate action. That creature must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier) or it dies, you gain 2d8 temporary hit points, and your effective caster level increases by 1 for 10 minutes or until the next time you cast a spell, whichever comes first. Temporary hit points gained from this ability stack, but the effective caster level increases don't stack with each other.

2: Dagger of Night (Su) As a move action, you can conjure a blade of darkness into your hand. This blade of darkness functions as a dagger, but deals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + 1 point per 3 character levels + your Strength modifier; half of this damage is piercing and the other half is cold damage. The blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The blade lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level, though the blade immediately vanishes if it leaves your hand. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1); you can expend two uses of this ability with the same move action to conjure two daggers (wielding one in each hand) if you wish.
3: Umbral Form (Su) As a standard action, you can weave strands of shadow-stuff into your physical form. You gain DR 10/- and cold resistance 15. When you take damage from a critical hit or sneak attack, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This does not stack with similar abilities that negate critical hits and sneak attacks (such as <a href="magicarmordisplay7af0.html?ItemName=Fortification%20(light)">fortification</a> armor). You gain the see in darkness supernatural ability (Bestiary 2 301) allowing you to see in areas of even magical darkness. In areas of dim light or darker, you can move as if affected by <a href="spelldisplay274d.html?ItemName=air%20walk">air walk</a>. You can return to your normal form as a free action. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your character level, and these rounds need not be consecutive.
