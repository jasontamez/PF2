Obedience

Find a physical boundary between two places, such as a doorway, a bridge, or even just a line drawn in the sand. Kneel with your back to this boundary and contemplate all the ways your life has changed during the previous day-this could be as simple as a new person you met in passing. Stand, turn, and step across the boundary while chanting a prayer to Alseta. On the other side, kneel and meditate on the transitions and changes that await you in the coming day. At the end of this meditation, out of respect for the transition to the new day, vow to perform a mundane task in a distinctly different manner during the coming day than you have done previously. You then gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Disable Device checks to unlock doors and a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Perception checks to detect secret doors. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

1: Keeper of Keys (Sp) hold portal 3/day, knock 2/day, or glyph of warding 1/day
2: Safe Passage (Ex) Alseta smiles upon your attempts to clear away obstacles that would hinder travelers' passage. You do not risk triggering a trap while attempting Disable Device checks unless you fail your check by 10 or more, rather than by 5 or more as normal. If the trap is part of a door or archway, or is otherwise triggered by passing through a door or archway, you gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on your Disable Device check.
3: Summon Door (Sp) You have an uncanny knack for acting as a holy gatekeeper against those who would stand against you. Three times per day, you can use passwall as a spell-like ability. When using this ability, you also conjure a strong wooden door (hardness 10, hp 40, break DC 30) at one end of the passageway produced by the spell. The door has a lock requiring either a plain iron key (which magically appears in your possession) or a successful DC 30 Disable Device check to open. You can also conjure the door so it comes into being already unlocked and open.

Exalted

1: Warden (Sp) alarm 3/day, arcane lock 2/day, or greater stunning barrier 1/day
2: Turning of the Seasons (Sp) You have a deep understanding of your goddess's connection to teleportation. Once per day, you can use teleport as a spell-like ability. When you use this ability, increase your familiarity of your intended destination by one step (a place you've viewed once becomes a place you've seen casually, a place you've seen casually becomes a place you've studied carefully, etc.). Using this ability cannot result in a mishap; if you roll a mishap on the spell's table when determining how well the teleportation works, treat it as a result of a "similar area."
3: Eviction (Sp) The Welcomer trusts your judgment enough to grant you powerful magic to keep your enemies at bay. Once per day as a standard action, you can bar all creatures from passing through a specific door or entrance within 30 feet of your position. This functions as the spell antilife shell, except that it functions on all creatures regardless of their type. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. If a creature trying to penetrate the barrier has spell resistance, you must overcome that resistance in order to keep it out. You can use your Hit Dice in place of your caster level on this spell resistance check.

1: Watchful (Sp) line in the sand 3/day, mirror image 2/day, or countless eyes 1/day
2: Past and Future (Ex) You catch glimpses of the future that allow you to avoid your enemies' strikes. You gain improved uncanny dodge as a rogue of a level equal to your Hit Dice. If you already possess the improved uncanny dodge ability, or if you would gain it later, you instead gain a +2 sacred or profane bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on attack and damage rolls against creatures that are currently flanking you.
3: Portal to Safety (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can transform an open door or archway into a temporary one-way portal, connecting it to another open door or archway of your choice that you have seen or of which you have a reliable description. This portal functions as a greater teleport spell targeting any creature that passes through the first doorway until the end of your next turn. All creatures that pass through the doorway, up to the limit imposed by the spell and your Hit Dice, arrive at the same location, and the destination must include an open door or archway from which the targets exit.

Paladin Code

As the intermediary between and servitor to the other civilized gods, Alseta prefers to remain neutral in conflicts among the gods. This impartiality naturally extends to her faithful, and thus followers of Alseta rarely become paladins.

The elves of Kyonin are a noteworthy exception to this trend. Elves who revere Alseta as the patron goddess of the aiudara (or "elf gates") swear oaths in her name to defend these sacred elven relics from those who would visit destruction upon them, including the fiendish Treerazer and his demonic forces. In addition to the normal paladin code, the tenets of these elven paladins of Alseta include the following affirmations. <ul><li>Doorways are sacred boundaries and should be respected. I will not transgress across the threshold of an occupied structure uninvited unless doing so serves the glory of Alseta or is necessary to prevent a great evil from taking place.</li><li>The Sovyrian Stone is a blessing from the goddess and is the beating heart of the elven people. I will defend it with my life.</li><li>The aiudara are sacred relics and should never be used lightly. It is my responsibility to preserve the knowledge of the keys to these gates, and ensure they do not fall into the wrong hands.</li></ul>
