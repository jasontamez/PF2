Obedience

Steal a coin or button from someone that isn't likely to miss it or need it. While unobserved, balance the coin or button on the edge of a weapon, flip it into the air, and call out how it will land. If you are right, find someone else to give the coin or button to-perhaps even its original owner-and explain how the token will bring good fortune. Gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls with the type of weapon (for example, short swords) you used to balance the object. If you can't find someone to take the coin or button after an hour, or if you were wrong in calling how it will land, hide it somewhere where it will be found and where the finder might deem himself lucky for discovering it. In this case, you gain only a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls with the weapon type.

2: Confident Gambler (Su) While many creatures rely on their luck, your faith allows you to control your luck to a small degree. Except when performing Chaldira's obedience, you can determine as a free action how an ordinary coin you flip or ordinary die you toss will land. If you use this ability for your own personal gain to the detriment of someone who is innocent or less fortunate than you are, you are likely to incur Chaldira's disfavor and lose the use of this boon until you atone, as set forth in the <a href="spelldisplayc22b.html?ItemName=atonement">atonement</a> spell. When used to recover the use of this boon, an <a href="spelldisplayc22b.html?ItemName=atonement">atonement</a> spell has an additional monetary cost equal to the amount you gained due to the misuse of this ability. If you instead return the amount you gained to the person you acquired it from (or to the person's family, community, friends, or other appropriate connection) and provide a genuine apology, then the <a href="spelldisplayc22b.html?ItemName=atonement">atonement</a> spell has no additional cost.
3: Auspicious Accuracy (Su) Your ability to control your luck expands to desperate situations of life and death. A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once per day), when you would normally roll a miss chance percentage, you can instead choose whether or not to hit. This ability manifests as a lucky turn of the blade or an awkward lunge that appears to be an overcorrection but actually places your attack right where it needs to be. Observers are likely to consider you exceptionally fortunate in your attacks, rather than suspect that you are supernaturally guided to bypass effects that would cause you to miss.
