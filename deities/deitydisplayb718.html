Obedience

Steal a gold coin or alcoholic drink by force or trickery. Then, while recounting your latest or most impressive act of piracy and blessing Besmara's name for all to hear, offer your stolen item to her by throwing it into water at least 4 feet deep. Alternatively, you can recount your most impressive or recent act of piracy to someone unaware of it, although you are free to hide the fact that the act was yours. You then gain a +2 sacred or profane bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

1: Tricky Adversary (Sp) illusion of calm 3/day, daze monster 2/day, or twilight knife 1/day
2: Coerce Service (Su) You understand and can exhibit the blatantly charismatic pull of your goddess, convincing others to aid you even if they normally might not. Once per day, when you attempt a Diplomacy check to bribe a target (treat as if you are attempting to improve an NPC's attitude toward you by one step) or an Intimidate check to coerce a target, you can use this ability to gain Besmara's blessing to ensure further cooperation. You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on the Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and if you succeed, the target is immediately subject to a geas/quest effect. For as long as the effect lasts, you can concentrate as a standard action and learn whether the target is actively undertaking your orders or actively defying them.
3: Bribed Sea Monster (Sp) The sea monsters at Besmara's behest follow your call at the goddess's command. Once per day as a standard action, you can summon one of the monsters Besmara has bribed or intimidated into aiding her followers. You must choose the monster from among the following list: adult sea dragon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 96), sea serpent (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 244), or vouivre (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 270). The monster appears as if summoned via summon monster, and you must summon it into an appropriately watery environment. It follows your commands perfectly for 1 round per Hit Die you possess before vanishing. The monster doesn't follow commands that contravene Besmara's interests, such as blocking waterways or giving a navy better control of a sea region; issuing such untenable instructions, if they're egregious, could cause the monster to attack you.

1: Captain's Bluster (Sp) command 3/day, aggressive thundercloud 2/day, or wind wall 1/day
2: Treacherous Mirage (Sp) Besmara's blessing allows you to hide the truth once per day. This ability takes the form of either false vision or mirage arcana. You can change the illusion by spending a move action in concentration. The illusion lasts until you create a new one or dismiss this effect as a swift action.
3: Rally Crew (Su) The Pirate Queen lends you her divine panache, which fills all of your allies with courage and pride in their service to you. Once per day as a standard action, you can inspire all allies within 60 feet to greater speed and might. They each gain a 10-foot bonus to their speed and the benefits of heroism. On any attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks benefiting from this morale bonus, your allies take no penalties due to the effects of water or weather. The bonus lasts for 1 hour per Hit Die you possess. As an immediate action, you can cause any number of creatures who disobey your orders to lose this bonus.

1: Fearsome Boast (Sp) monkey fish 3/day, slipstream 2/day, or water breathing 1/day
2: Doom of Sailors (Sp) You can immobilize ships or scatter a fleet with a wave of your hand. Once per day, you can cast either control water or control winds.
3: Pirate Queen's Curse (Su) You know that the Pirate Queen's enemies are destined to suffer, and you can deliver her wrath personally. Three times per day, you can channel a curse through your weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you make the attack roll. On a hit, the target is cursed unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). The curse causes the target to be sickened for a number of days equal to your Hit Dice; furthermore, during this period, any creatures flanking the target or against which it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with every successful hit. This extra damage applies to the attack that delivers the curse. In addition, all creatures with a swim speed have a starting attitude of hostile toward the target. This is a 7th-level curse effect. The curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed through break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.

Antipaladin Code

Antipaladins of Besmara are cutthroat pirates, freely roaming where they will and seizing whatever interests them. They primarily emulate their goddess's violent aspects, but different antipaladins focus on varied aspects of Besmara's code. The code of Besmara's antipaladins includes the following adages. <ul><li>I pursue what I desire. One who cannot keep it from me does not deserve to possess it.</li><li>Treasure demonstrates my might. I won't waste my time on schemes with no profit to be had.</li><li>No trick is beneath me. I will never forgo an advantage in the name of fairness.</li><li>Pride does not shackle me. I retreat if I must to survive for another day.</li><li>The weak serve the strong. I will never let my crew forget or doubt my strength.</li><li>Revenge can be delayed to keep the ship sailing. Crew members who cross me shall die onshore; foes can be useful allies under changed circumstances.</li><li>I will suffer no restraint. Those who seek to pacify me will fall broken in my wake.</li></ul>
