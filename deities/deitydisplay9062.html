Obedience

Spend 30 minutes in meditation, clearing your mind of needs and prejudices. Then briefly wander and observe your surroundings, seeking a source of excess, accomplishment, or emptiness. Spend at least 30 minutes counteracting that phenomenon in some way, such as by creating something where nothing exists, providing comfort to a morose stranger, or thinning the excess population of ants in a field. Upon completing this obedience, choose two Knowledge skills; you gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on checks with those skills.

2: Immaterial Flesh (Su) You gain the constant benefits of the <a href="magicarmordisplaya46e.html?ItemName=Fortification%20(moderate)">moderate fortification</a> armor special ability. If you already have a similar defensive ability, you increase that ability's chance to negate the additional damage by 10%.
3: Creative Destruction (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can touch two adjacent creatures (including yourself). One takes 150 points of damage (Fortitude half; DC = 10 + half your HD + your Charisma modifier), and the other regains a number of hit points equal to the damage taken by the first target.
