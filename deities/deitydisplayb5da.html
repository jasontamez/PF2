Obedience

Spend at least an hour teaching someone to read, analyze allegories, or otherwise improve her self-education skills. You can also use this time to study under a more learned teacher. If neither a student nor a teacher is available, spend the hour working on a literacy primer, book of fables, or other educational text to be donated to a school or library. After devoting an hour to this work, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks for the next 24 hours.

1: Transcendent Mind (Sp) <a href="spelldisplaye744.html?ItemName=burst%20of%20insight">burst of insight</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay6e9f.html?ItemName=calm%20emotions">calm emotions</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay9281.html?ItemName=share%20language,%20communal">communal share language</a> 1/day
2: Clarity's Blessing (Su) The clarity of your teaching can shelter others from certain mental assaults. Once per day as a swift action, you can invoke Gruhastha's blessing to grant companions within 60 feet a +4 sacred bonus on saves against confusion and fear effects. You can protect a number of people equal to your Hit Die, and the protection lasts for an hour.
3: Keeper's Mercy (Su) Though you are willing to use violence in the face of implacable evils, it is always a last resort and used as precisely and minimally as possible. Even in the midst of combat, you do your best to reduce true harm. For a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, you can cause your own attacks with unarmed strikes, weapons, and natural weapons or those of another creature within 10 feet of you to deal nonlethal damage. Damage dealt to creatures or objects that are not subject to nonlethal damage is not converted and remains lethal damage. An unwilling target can negate this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier).

1: Speaker of Fable (Sp) <a href="spelldisplay1cbe.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20animal">speak with animal</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplayba71.html?ItemName=animal%20aspect,%20greater">greater animal aspect</a> 1/day
2: Trace Corruption (Su) You are a champion of the truth, and have been granted the divine insight to know when other creatures are being forced to act counter to their own natures. You can detect charms, compulsions, and possession effects, as per <a href="spelldisplay5c12.html?ItemName=detect%20charm">detect charm</a>, by concentrating for 1 round on a single creature within 100 feet. If you identify such an effect, you can concentrate for another round to obtain a glimpse of the effect's creator in your mind's eye. Such images are foggy and fragmentary, sufficient to determine the creature's type and a vague description, but not enough to identify individuals unless they bear unusual distinguishing marks. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half your Hit Dice.
3: Sacred Tutelage (Su) Though you are willing to confront dangers directly, you also educate fellow companions and like-minded faiths in the best practices for defeating their shared foes; as it is written in the Azvadeva Pujila, each warrior can aim only a single spear, but a teacher can aim ten thousand. As a swift action, you can provide divine guidance to your allies in combat. Allies able to see you gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls. You can provide your guidance for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice per day (maximum 20 rounds). The rounds in which you provide guidance don't need to be consecutive, and you can end this ability as a free action.

Paladin Code

Paladins of Gruhastha are rare, for the Keeper's is not a martial faith. Those who champion his faith through arms typically do so out of need to travel to secluded villages or because they are sworn to protect specific holy sites or teachers. The code of Gruhastha's paladins contains the following adages. <ul><li>Transcendence requires tranquility. No one can learn who is hungry or afraid. My first goal must be to ensure peace and stability for the greatest number of people possible. </li><li>Enlightenment requires truth. I will not deny knowledge to those who seek answers without ill will, even if it seems to be harmful in the short term, as those who have false information will follow a false path. </li><li>All can find their way to enlightenment. Whenever possible, intelligent creatures should be reasoned with and their grievances understood. Even if no negotiated resolution is possible, the use of force is always to be regretted, for it represents a failure. </li><li>Ignorance is not malice. The misguided deserve mercy. They should be shown the error of their ways and given a fair chance to make amends. </li><li>Malice creates ignorance. Those who deliberately blind themselves to the concerns of others, the consequences of their actions, or the obligations of empathy spread and encourage these behaviors to those around them. Those who mislead others or argue in bad faith for the sake of their own selfishness must be opposed, and the truth of their actions revealed.</li>
