Obedience

Sing a song in praise of freedom, bravery, and your god's glory (and good looks). The song must be audible to those nearby-friend or foe. Between stanzas, you must pause to drink from a full mug of ale, wine, or other spirits. When the song is done, drink the remaining alcohol while mentally composing the song you will sing on the morrow. If a creature is attracted by your song, do your best to engage it in conversation about the merits of Cayden Cailean. If hostilities become inevitable, leap boldly into the fight without hesitation. Gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against poison effects.

Nethys Note: See <a href="rulese221.html?Name=Divine%20Gifts&amp;Category=Role%20of%20the%20Divine">here</a> for details on how to gain a Divine Gift
When the character is affected by an effect that <a href="spelldisplaybd52.html?ItemName=Freedom">freedom</a> can prevent, he can immediately avoid that effect. He must choose to use this gift the instant the effect occurs; if he opts not to use the gift to avoid such a fate, he can save it for use against a future immobilization effect, but he cannot use it to escape the ongoing effect he chose not to avoid.

1: Liberation (Sp) liberating command 3/day, knock 2/day, or dispel magic 1/day
2: Drinking Buddy (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can create an illusory double of yourself that appears in a square adjacent to you. Your double acts on your initiative count, and can move up to your speed each round. It always attempts to flank with you against a single target you designate. If it must use Acrobatics to avoid an attack of opportunity during this movement, your double uses your bonus. Though your double can't attack, it is treated as threatening adjacent squares for the purposes of flanking with you. Anyone attacking your double or otherwise physically interacting with it can attempt a Will save (DC 25) to recognize the double as an illusion. The double has your AC, and if any hit would deal damage to it, the double dissipates. An opponent who recognizes your double as an illusion can't be flanked by it. The double lasts 1 round for every Hit Die you possess or until it is hit with an attack, whichever comes first.
3: Intoxicating Strike (Su) Once per day, you can declare one of your attacks an intoxicating strike. You must declare your use of this ability before you attempt the attack roll. If your attack hits and you deal damage, your target immediately becomes intoxicated for 1 round for every Hit Die you possess. An intoxicated creature takes a -4 penalty to AC, on attack rolls, and on skill checks, and its movement is reduced by 10 feet.

Exalted

1: Libations (Sp) bless water 3/day, delay poison 2/day, or create food and water 1/day
2: Freedom's Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a pair of bralani azatas to aid you. You gain telepathy with the bralanis to a range of 100 feet. The bralanis follow your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to their home in Elysium. The bralanis don't follow commands that would cause them to commit evil acts or restrict freedom solely for the sake of law. Such commands not only earn refusal and scorn from the bralanis, but could cause the bralanis to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.
3: Wine to Water (Su) As a full-round action, you transform a single serving of an alcoholic beverage into either potent holy water or a potion of cure serious wounds. A potion created in this way heals 3d8 points of damage plus 1 point of damage for every Hit Die you possess (to a maximum of 3d8+15). The holy water you create is more potent than usual, dealing 4d4 points of damage to an undead creature or evil outsider, and 2d4 points of splash damage to each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits. Holy water and potions created in this way last for 1 hour. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).

Sentinel

1: Devastating Duelist (Sp) bless weapon 3/day, brow gasher 2/day, or greater magic weapon 1/day
2: Light Weapon Master (Ex) Whenever you fight with a dagger, kama, kukri, rapier, sickle, short sword, or starknife, you also gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC, provided you have the weapon training (light blades) class feature. If you don't have that class feature, you instead gain a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls when using weapons from the light blades weapon group (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 47).
3: Critical Luck (Ex) Keep a record of every time you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll, to a maximum number equal to your Charisma bonus. Anytime you roll a critical threat on an attack roll, you can trade in one of your tallied natural 1s to automatically confirm the critical hit. This tally resets to 0 every day, and any tallied natural 1s from the day before are lost.

Cayden Cailean's Blade and Tankard

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdy?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Weapon-Masters-Handbook">Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 11</a>
Cayden Cailean is famous for wading into battle with a tankard in his off hand.

Optional Replacement: A chaotic good fighter or swashbuckler who worships Cayden Cailean can replace proficiency with shields or bucklers with the following initial benefit.

Initial Benefit: You can wield a tankard (or mug) as a weapon, treating it in all ways as a light mace appropriate for your size. If you engage in two-weapon fighting with a rapier or light weapon in one hand and a tankard in the other, you can drink a potion or other liquid from the tankard or attempt to toss liquid from the tankard as a dirty trick combat maneuver (such as to blind a foe) in place of attacking with it. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity for attempting a dirty trick maneuver with a tankard.

Advanced Prerequisites: Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, base attack bonus +10.

Optional Replacement: A chaotic good fighter or swashbuckler of at least 10th level who worships Cayden Cailean can replace a bonus feat or deed with the following advanced benefit, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites.

Advanced Benefit: You can refill your tankard with a beverage, potion, or other liquid from a bottle or vial as a swift action. You gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to perform dirty tricks with tankards. The effects of such a dirty trick lasts for 1d4 rounds + 1 round for every 5 points by which the result of your combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD; a standard action is required for the target to remove this penalty.
