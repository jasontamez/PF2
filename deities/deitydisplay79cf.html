1: Sibilant (Sp) <a href="spelldisplay6920.html?ItemName=aphasia">aphasia</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay5190.html?ItemName=sonic%20scream">sonic scream</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay4d62.html?ItemName=tongues">tongues</a> 1/day
2: Burning Tongue (Ex) As a standard action three times per day, you can transform your mouth into a serpentine maw with a tongue of roiling sonic energy. This grants you a ranged touch attack that targets a single creature within 30 feet. The attack deals 8d6 points of sonic damage and renders the target confused for 1d4 rounds. In addition, a creature hit by this attack must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or it is unable to communicate by any spoken or written language for a number of hours equal to your Wisdom modifier.
3: Screams of the Deep (Sp) As a standard action, you can cast either <a href="spelldisplay2770.html?ItemName=power%20word%20blind">power word blind</a>, <a href="spelldisplaycd58.html?ItemName=power%20word%20kill">power word kill</a>, <a href="spelldisplayed99.html?ItemName=power%20word%20stun">power word stun</a>, or <a href="spelldisplay9ef1.html?ItemName=word%20of%20chaos">word of chaos</a> as a spell-like ability, treating your character level as your caster level. You can cast these spell-like abilities a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), but you cannot repeat the spell you most recently cast. The saving throw DC, when applicable, is equal to 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier.
