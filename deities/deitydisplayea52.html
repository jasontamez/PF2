Obedience

Spend an hour reliving or imagining terrible things that happened to you. This process is mentally strenuous, dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. You cannot allow anyone else to know of your struggles: speaking of them, showing distress while considering them, or even asking for assistance in healing the nonlethal damage negates the benefits of this obedience. When you fail a saving throw against a creature's spell or spell-like ability, you gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against any of that creature's abilities for 1 minute.

1: Hidden Resolve (Sp) <a href="spelldisplay5465.html?ItemName=disguise%20self">disguise self</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay2dd7.html?ItemName=obscure%20object">obscure object</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay6c8d.html?ItemName=bestow%20curse">bestow curse</a> 1/day
2: Unheralded Retribution (Su) You punish those foes who would use the arcane arts to infringe upon your autonomy and well-being. Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability cast or used by a creature, that creature becomes flat-footed against your attacks until the end of your next turn. In addition, your attacks against that creature while it is flat-footed deal 1 additional point of bleed damage; this bleed damage stacks with itself.
3: Sovereign Constancy (Su) Much like Arazni herself, you prize the sanctuary of your own thoughts, and you have built defenses and protections lest others try to take away or taint this refuge. Once per day as an immediate action whenever you are affected by a mind-affecting effect, you can use <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> on yourself as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice.

2: Strength in Bloodshed (Su) The Red Crusader knew well the value of fighting alongside allies-and the price to be paid when those allies fail. Rather than relying upon the assistance of fickle and fallible mortals, you can bring forth a construct gathered from the blood spilled by Arazni and her followers. Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a <a href="monsterdisplay3e7b.html?ItemName=Blood%20Golem">blood golem</a> to aid you. You gain telepathy with the golem to a range of 100 feet. The golem follows your commands perfectly for a number of minutes equal to your number of Hit Dice before vanishing back to its home.
3: Shield of Scars (Sp) When you heal yourself with a cure or inflict spell (as appropriate depending upon your physiology), scars form over your body. You gain a profane bonus to Armor Class equal to the spell's level for 1 minute.

2: Subliminal Intransigence (Su) Through ceaseless conditioning, you have constructed insurmountable mental defenses that deny others the ability to sway your thoughts, whether for good or for ill. You gain immunity to charm and compulsion effects and a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects.
3: Fallen Crusader's Retaliation (Su) The Red Queen's life is a painful example of the danger of falling prey to the arcane arts, and you have learned from this lesson. Ever wary of those who wield magic in battle, you hone your reflexes to strike when least expected. Creatures you threaten that fail their checks to cast spells defensively provoke attacks of opportunity from you.
