Obedience

Spend an hour working a piece of stone into a tool, a vurra, a weapon, or a stone that is destined to be engraved as part of Minderhal's holy text using only your hands or a tool that uses only your own strength and skill (rather than something that requires another person such as a long saw or a machine such as a mill). Recite relevant passages from One Hundred Sacred Stones while you craft this object. Gain a +1 profane bonus on Strength checks and on attack rolls with thrown weapons.

Evangelist

1: Master of Earth (Sp) expeditious excavation 3/day, instrument of agony 2/day, or burrow 1/day
2: Hands of Justice (Su) For a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, you can infuse your slams or a melee weapon you wield with the power of pure law. Your attacks with these weapons gain the axiomatic weapon special ability. Any attacks that would damage these weapons first have their damage reduced by 5 before you apply DR, hardness, or any resistances. Activating or dismissing this ability is a free action, and the rounds need not be consecutive. Any weapon affected by this ability returns to normal 1 round after it leaves your hands.
3: Maker's Gift (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, you can grant Minderhal's gift of power to a willing humanoid creature by touching it. The target gains a +2 profane bonus to Strength or a +4 profane bonus on Craft checks relating to stone. A creature can have no more than one Maker's gift from an evangelist at a time. As long as the gift persists, you can speak telepathically with the target across any distance (but this does not grant it the ability to reply). The Maker's gift is removed by dispel evil or dispel law. You can remove the gift as a free action, dealing 1d4 points of Wisdom damage to the target as a result. The target cannot attempt a saving throw against this effect.
