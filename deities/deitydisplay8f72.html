1: Infesting Invocation (Sp) ray of enfeeblement 3/day, protection from spores 2/day, or fungal infestation 1/day
2: Seed the Unseeded (Sp) Up to three times per day, as a swift action when you cast any mind-affecting spell, you can cause that spell to behave as if you were under the effects of what grows within.
3: Extract Griefgall (Su) Twice per day, you can wrack a target with pain. The target must be within 30 feet and in line of sight. As a standard action, you deal 1d6 points of Constitution damage to the target, who then becomes nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction, but can affect only living creatures. If the target creature succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifier), it negates the Constitution damage and is staggered for 1 round instead. Regardless of the success or failure of this saving throw, a monstrous parasite is expelled from the target's body, either from an orifice or from a wound. If the target succeeded at its saving throw, the parasite expelled is a single griefgall (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5 133). If the target failed its saving throw, advanced griefgalls emerge instead; the number that emerge is equal to 1 + the amount of Constitution damage the victim took. The griefgalls are not under your control, but they regard you as an ally.

1: Fester the Flesh (Sp) decompose corpse 3/day, pox pustules 2/day, or undead anatomy I 1/day
2: Festering Strike (Su) As a swift action whenever you confirm a critical hit against a creature with a weapon or spell, you can forgo the additional damage that the critical hit would otherwise have dealt and instead afflict the creature struck with a rotting toxin. The creature can resist this effect with a successful Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Constitution modifier), but otherwise it immediately takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage as its flesh withers and rots away. On a successful save, the victim takes no ability damage but is instead sickened for 1d4 rounds. If your weapon has a critical modifier of ??3, the victim takes a -2 penalty on the saving throw to resist your festering strike, and if your weapon has a critical modifier of ??4 or higher, this penalty increases to -4. This is a poison effect.
3: Shed Life (Sp) Once per day, you can cast undead anatomy IV as a spell-like ability. If you are already undead, you also gain the effects of a harm spell as this spell-like ability takes effect, and adjacent living creatures are targeted by an inflict serious wounds effect as if you had cast that spell on them.

1: Twisted Nature (Sp) entangle 3/day, alter self 2/day, or excruciating deformation 1/day
2: Transformation Mastery (Su) The save DCs of polymorph effects you create increase by 2, and all polymorph spells that affect you are enhanced as if via the Extend Spell metamagic feat. When you are in a form other than your own, you exalt in your temporary body and gain a +2 profane bonus on saving throws. In addition, you gain the shapechanger subtype, and your attacks are particularly painful to other creatures with this subtype, since you use your mastery of transformation to twist the mutable elements of the shapechanger's flesh to cause additional harm. Add your Charisma bonus as a modifier to all weapon damage dealt to creatures with the shapechanger subtype or creatures under the effects of a polymorph spell. Increase the save DC of any spell that deals hit point damage by 2 when you affect a shapechanger or a polymorphed target.
3: Awaken Life (Sp) Once per day, you can cast polymorph any object as a spell-like ability, but only to transform an inanimate nonmagical object into a living creature. The creature's physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) become 20, and its mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) become 10. The creature's alignment is neutral evil, and while you do not control it, the creature recognizes you as an ally. If the creature you create is a plant, the duration of the polymorph any object effect is doubled.
