Boons - Qlippoth Lords
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 129</a>
Qlippoth lords are always chaotic evil and range in power from CR 21 to CR 25. It's quite likely that more powerful creatures akin to demigods in stature may still exist in the deepest parts of the Abyss, but such qlippoth demigods remain theoretical for now, and they do not maintain active cults on mortal worlds. The boons qlippoth lords grant are less complex than those granted by fiendish demigods, manifesting as spell-like abilities usable twice per day each.
