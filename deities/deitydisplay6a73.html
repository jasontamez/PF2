1: Sickness Within (Sp) ray of enfeeblement 3/day, warp wood 2/ day, or contagion 1/day
2: Parasitic Link (Su) Once per day with a successful touch attack, you can infest a living creature with tiny worms and gnawing mites unless the target makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Constitution modifier). These parasites retain an unholy link to you, draining that creature's energy and transferring it to you. This infestation persists for 10 rounds, during which you act as if hasted and the infested victim is staggered. As a swift action, you can quicken the parasitic infestation-this reduces the remaining duration by 1 round, but causes the parasites to chew and feed at an accelerated rate, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage to the target. You can only maintain a parasitic link with one creature at a time. These parasites count as a disease effect.
3: Fungal Ruin (Sp) Once per day, you may target a creature with a destruction spell. A creature slain by this effect crumbles into a mound of russet mold (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 273) that immediately releases a cloud of spores in a 20-foot-radius burst. This ability functions as a 9th-level spell.

1: Contamination (Sp) ray of sickening  3/day, pox pustules 2/day, or fungal infestation 1/day
2: Cloud of Toxicity (Su) As a standard action, you can exhale a 20-foot cone of a disgusting miasma that exacerbates disease. Each diseased creature in the cone must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if it fails, it immediately takes damage as though it had failed its Fortitude saves against all of its diseases, and any remaining onset times for these diseases end. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.
3: Ravaging Harm (Su) Three times per day with a successful touch attack, you can weaken a living creature's immune system unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). For the next 24 hours, when a creature that failed its save takes ability damage, 1 point of that damage becomes permanent ability drain instead. This is a curse effect, and it can be removed with a remove curse spell (treat your total Hit Dice as the caster level).

1: Sickness Within (Sp) ray of enfeeblement 3/day, warp wood 2/day, or contagion 1/day
2: Parasitic Link (Su) Once per day with a successful touch attack, you can infest a living creature with tiny, gnawing, parasitic worms unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier). These parasites retain an unholy link to you, draining the target creature's energy and transferring it to you. This infestation persists for 10 rounds, during which you act as if under the effects of a haste spell and the infested victim is staggered. As a swift action, you can quicken the parasitic infestation-this reduces the remaining duration by 1 round, but the target takes 1d3 points of Charisma damage as the parasites feed at an accelerated rate. You can maintain a parasitic link with only one creature at a time. These parasites count as a disease effect.
3: Fungal Ruin (Sp) Once per day, you can target a creature with a destruction spell. A creature slain by this effect crumbles into a mound of russet mold that immediately releases a cloud of spores in a 20-foot-radius burst.

Sentinel

1: Deadly Nature (Sp) thorn javelin  3/day, sickening entanglement 2/day, or command plants 1/day
2: Vicious Thorns (Su) As a standard action, you can cause the ground in a 5-foot-radius burst centered on you to sprout twisting, thorny vines. Creatures moving through the area must travel at half speed or take bleed damage equal to half your character level; if you activate this ability in an area with numerous plants (grass, trees, weeds, etc.), the area also becomes difficult terrain. These effects last for 1 minute, after which the vines crumble to dust. Creatures able to move through natural undergrowth unhindered ignore the effects of this ability. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.
3: Shambling Form (Su) Once per day as a move action, you can assume the form of a Huge shambling mound. You gain a +8 size bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, and a +6 natural armor bonus. You gain a constrict special attack and two slam attacks that each deal 2d8 points of damage plus your Strength modifier and have the grab special attack. You gain darkvision (60 feet) and resistance 20 to electricity and fire. In addition, if you are struck with an attack that deals an amount of electricity damage that is less than your resistance, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level. You lose these temporary hit points after 1 hour. You return to your true form after 10 minutes or when you take a free action to dismiss this ability, whichever comes first.
