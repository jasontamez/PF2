1: Sacrament (Sp) sanctuary 3/day, consecrate 2/day, or prayer 1/day
2: Liturgy (Su) Three times per day, you can ask for Winlas's favor whenever you are observing a religious ceremony within 300 feet. When you do this, you and up to one additional creature per 2 HD you possess assume the appearance of the congregation you are observing with perfect accuracy, and you all gain complete knowledge of the sacred rites being performed (granting you a +10 sacred bonus on Bluff checks to perform the rites). This ability is otherwise like a seeming spell, except you gain a +20 bonus on your Disguise check.
3: Ritual of True Faith (Sp) Once per day, you can cast either symbol of death, symbol of insanity, symbol of stunning, or symbol of weakness. Your casting time for this spell-like ability is reduced to 1 minute.
