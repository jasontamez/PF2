1: Lunar Dancer (Sp) faerie fire 3/day, cat's grace 2/day, or daylight 1/day (visible effect is moonlight)
2: Moonlight (Sp) You can cast an enlarged sunbeam once per day. The visible effect is a beam of brilliant silver moonlight, but the spell's effects are unchanged.
3: Compelling Dance (Sp) You can cast irresistible dance once per day. If you cast this spell-like ability on a willing creature, the target is affected normally by the spell but also gains a +4 sacred bonus on Dexterity checks, Dexterity-based skill checks, and Reflex saves for 24 hours after the effect's initial duration ends.

2: Touch of Freedom (Su) As a standard action, you can touch an ally to grant it the benefits of the <a href="spelldisplayd71b.html?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement">freedom of movement</a> spell until the beginning of your next turn. While under this effect, the target gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base speed when taking the withdraw action and can, as an immediate action when she fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, reroll that saving throw. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
3: Navigator Wisp (Sp) Once per day, you can cast an <a href="spelldisplayb825.html?ItemName=find%20the%20path">extended find the path</a> on yourself with a caster level equal to your character level. The effect of the spell manifests as a mote of light that is visible to only you. If the route would take you through dangerous territory (such as a river with a very strong current or a hidden pit of acid), the wisp glows yellow. If the route would take you past hidden creatures, the wisp flashes red, giving you a +10 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to notice them.
