Obedience

Assemble a careful list of each activity you will undertake in the day to come and keep a careful accounting of what you fail to accomplish and why. As part of this, select three different specific checks you expect to perform that day, such as "a Perception check to find a hidden passage," "a Reflex save to dodge a fireball" or "a Heal check to treat a disease." Once during that day, you can gain a +4 insight bonus on one of these three specified checks.
