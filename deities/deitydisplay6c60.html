Obedience

Spend an hour in absolute stillness, meditating in an area surrounded by rich furnishings and dressed in elegant and expensive clothing and jewelry. The total combined value of your clothing and the furnishings of the area within 30 feet of your meditation spot must be at least 1,000 gp per character level (magical items do not count in determining the overall value of your surroundings unless they are particularly ornate, in which case only the value over and above the item's normal cost counts). Alternatively, you can perform this obedience in the presence of an active Yellow Sign. If you know them, you must silently recite lines from The King In Yellow as you meditate-otherwise, you can simply concentrate on nothingness. You gain a +4 profane bonus on all Perform checks.

1: Words of Disorder (Sp) lesser confusion 3/day, hideous laughter 2/day, or rage 1/day
2: Confusion Command (Su) As a swift action, you can issue a verbal command to a single creature within 30 feet that is currently suffering from a confusion effect or a similar effect. This allows you to choose how that creature is affected on its turn that round.
3: Yellow Sign (Sp) You gain the ability to cast Yellow Sign once per day as a spell-like ability.

Exalted

1: Decadent Grace (Sp) disguise self 3/day, eagle's splendor 2/day, or glibness 1/day
2: No Mask! (Su) You gain the change shape (alter self, any humanoid of your size) ability, which is usable once per day. Transforming back to your true form is a free action, but as you do so, the unsettling effect of this change causes all creatures within 20 feet to become shaken for 1d4 rounds if they fail a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + your Wisdom modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice). If you make an initiative check in the same round that you assume your true form, you gain a +4 bonus on the initiative check.
3: Hedonist (Su) As long as you wear fine clothing and jewelry worth at least 500 gp per character level (magic items do not count in determining this value), you gain a deflection bonus to your Armor Class equal to your Charisma modifier. This ability doesn't function if you wear armor or carry a shield (including items that grant armor or shield bonuses).

Sentinel

1: All Things Must End (Sp) doom 3/day, death knell 2/day, or bestow curse 1/day
2: Impossible Mind (Ex) You are immune to confusion and insanity effects, save those created by Hastur or worshipers and servants of Hastur who have more Hit Dice than you.
3: Nihilist (Ex) You are immune to death and petrification effects. In addition, once per day if you are targeted by a death or petrification effect of any level that targets you alone, you can choose to reflect that death effect back on its source as per spell turning.
