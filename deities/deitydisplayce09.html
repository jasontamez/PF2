1: Fool Maker (Sp) charm person 3/day, undetectable alignment 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Persecutor (Ex) You can use your Bluff skill to demoralize opponents and influence an opponent's attitude as though it were the Intimidate skill. The effects function the same. Additionally, you may use the Knowledge (religion) skill on any check related to knowing about or interpreting the law-including infernal contracts.
3: Charming Liar (Su) Whenever you use the Bluff skill, you can use the Diplomacy skill to influence an NPC's attitude at the same time. Both skill checks are made independently, so even if one fails, the other might succeed'suggesting an obvious but charming falsehood or an aggravating but convincing lie. Additionally, any spell of the charm subschool that you cast has its DC increased by 2.

1: Faith Taker (Sp) unseen servant 3/day, detect thoughts 2/day, or glibness 1/day
2: False Priest (Su) You gain a +4 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as a worshiper of another deity and can cast spells using holy symbols other than your own. Additionally, for a number of hours per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can disguise your alignment. By spending a standard action, you hide your true alignment and instead detect as being of the same alignment as the deity whose holy symbol you are wearing.
3: Revoke Healing (Su) A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can deal damage to a creature in your line of sight that you have magically healed within the past 24 hours. The damage equals the amount restored by the highest-level spell with the healing descriptor that you can cast. This may result in you causing more damage than you healed. The damage occurs in a single round. In the case of healing spells that heal over multiple rounds, only healing provided in the first round is counted when determining damage.

1: Trust Breaker (Sp) doom 3/day, eagle's splendor 2/day, or keen edge 1/day
2: Spectacular Rival (Su) A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), you can add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to your combat maneuver bonus.
3: Fatal Choice (Su) Once per day, upon defeating an opponent, you can heal it and attempt to force it to obey you. As soon as you reduce a living creature to -1 or fewer hit points, you can force it to attempt a Will saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier. If it succeeds, it begins dying as normal. If the target fails, it is restored to 1 hit point and is affected as per the spell charm monster. The target can willingly fail this saving throw. This effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). At the end of this period, the target can behave as normal.

1: Whispers from Caina (Sp) detect secret doors 3/day, augury 2/day, or blood biography 1/day
2: Enter the Hellfire Testament (Su) As a standard action, you can forge deep and unsettling ties to the places and individuals around you. While this ability is in effect, an enemy that comes within 5 feet of you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be compelled to blurt out a single secret that looms heavy in its mind. This could be a personally embarrassing detail, or it could be secret plans to attack or sabotage you, at the GM's discretion. Additionally, creatures that fail their Will saving throws become confused for as long as you maintain this supernatural ability (once you've activated it, maintaining the Hellfire Testament is a free action). You can dismiss the Hellfire Testament as a free action, and you can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice. The duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-round increments. Regardless of its saving throw result, a creature subjected to this ability once can't be affected by it again for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.
3: Confide in the Crimson Son (Su) You have an uncanny, infernal knack for earning the trust of those with weak minds and weaker wills. Three times per day as a standard action, you can target a living creature and offer dark whispers of camaraderie and flattery. Unless the creature succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), it believes you are incredibly trustworthy and will refuse to harm you with any of its attacks or abilities for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice, and you gain a +20 profane bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence its attitude or make a request. If any of its allies attempt to harm you during this period, the creature will defend you however it is able. A creature can't be affected by this ability more than once in a 24-hour period. This is a mind-affecting effect.

1: Fulfilled by Hell (Sp) memorize page  3/day, honeyed tongue 2/day, or marionette possession 1/day
2: Signed with Visineir (Su) The full weight of the Crimson Son backs the infernal contracts you sign, even if the signatories are coerced or otherwise tricked into agreement. Three times per day as a standard action, you can target a creature to bind it into a special Hell-backed contract. If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice it cannot make any bodily contact with you, including attacking with manufactured weapons, as if it were a good-aligned summoned creature and you were affected with a protection from good spell. You can attack the affected creature without penalty. Every time the creature attempts to attack you while this ability is in effect, it is nauseated for 1 round (no saving throw).
3: Eternal Contractual Damnation (Sp) You can marshal the might of Hell to briefly imprison your enemies. This functions as mass icy prison, using your Hit Dice as your caster level, except the targets are trapped in infernal flames and the prison deals fire damage instead of cold damage. Affected creatures can quench the shifting wall of flames in the same way they could break an icy prison. (Create water has no effect on the flames, but casting a quench spell automatically extinguishes a single creature's prison).

1: Call of the Crimson Son (Sp) keen senses  3/day, blood armor 2/day, or chain of perdition 1/day
2: Bound to the Eighth (Sp) You are well versed in the complex and draconian laws of Hell and those that bind devils to service, and you can imitate this binding magic to weaken your foes. Once per day as a standard action, you can cast symbol of weakness.
3: King of Devils (Sp) You can call upon the infernal power of the legions of devils that answer to Mephistopheles to strengthen your body and mind. Once per day, you can summon two infernally loyal barbed devils to your side as if using summon monster IX.
