Obedience

Abstain from eating or drinking until you experience the bitter pangs of hunger. Meditate in this state for just under an hour, and then gorge yourself upon any available substance regardless of its suitability as food, such as sand, ashes, or flesh. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against effects that cause exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, or sickness.

1: Jackal's Blessing (Sp) memory lapse  3/day, false life 2/day, or vampiric touch 1/day
2: Unending Whispers (Sp) You can cast insanity once per day as a spell-like ability.
3: Kiss of the Lysogenic Prince (Su) You can make a touch attack to infect another creature with a fragment of your soul. The target can resist the attach with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Otherwise, while you and the target are on the same plane, as a free action you can observe what your target perceives with its senses. Once per day as a standard action, you can directly control the target's actions for 1 round plus a number of additional rounds equal to your Charisma bonus. The affected creature retains no memory of your controlling influence or its actions while controlled. This is a curse effect. You can have only one target affected by your kiss at a time; if you target another creature, the first is no longer affected.

Exalted

1: Jackal's Grace (Sp) ray of enfeeblement  3/day, feast of ashes 2/day, or cup of dust 1/day
2: Unending Hunger (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can consume any nonliving substance without ill effect. The size of the object consumed can be no larger than a creature of your own size category, but regardless of the size, consuming the object takes only 1 round. A body consumed in this way can be restored to life only via miracle, true resurrection, or wish. Any object you consume can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) to avoid being destroyed.
3: Withering Invocation (Sp) Once per day, you can invoke Trelmarixian's unending hunger to cause a number of victims to consume themselves from the inside out. You can cast implosion once per day as a spell-like ability.

Sentinel

1: Famine's Crusader (Sp) mount  3/day, wartrain mount 2/day, or phantom steed 1/day
2: Consumptive Aura (Su) As a swift action, you can radiate an aura of hunger to a radius of 20 feet. Once you activate this ability, you can maintain it each round as a free action. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice; these rounds need not be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-round increments. Each round a creature begins its turn within this aura, it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and become fatigued from extreme hunger. Creatures that don't need to eat are immune to this effect. You are immune to this effect, and although you still feel hunger pangs, you no longer take damage nor are otherwise inconvenienced by the effects of starvation.
3: Eruptive Arrival (Sp) Once per day, you can teleport yourself into the flesh of any living creature that you can see (as per greater teleport), erupting out of its body in a shower of blood, bone, and viscera, arriving in an adjacent square, and dealing 5d6 damage to all creatures within 10 feet. The target itself takes 20d6 points damage. The target and creatures in the affected areas can attempt Fortitude saves (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution bonus) to reduce the damage by half, but any creature that fails this saving throw is also nauseated for 1d4 rounds.
