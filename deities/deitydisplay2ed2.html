Obedience

Meditate in a private place before a trophy or broken religious symbol taken from a target you have been contracted to kill. This trophy must be anointed with a single drop of your blood, drawn from your flesh by a sawtooth sabre, and the trophy must be destroyed at the end of your meditation. If you have yet to complete a contract, have no appropriate trophies at hand, or seek to serve the Mantis God in other ways than as the god's assassin, you must instead offer your own vital fluid to He Who Walks in Blood by cutting yourself along the right arm with a sawtooth sabre. Such self-mutilation deals 1d6 points of damage to you, which cannot be healed during the hour of meditation without disrupting the obedience; after the meditation ends, the wounds can be healed by any means available. You gain a +2 profane bonus to confirm critical hits while wielding a sawtooth sabre. As long as you have a sawtooth sabre in each hand, you can use those blades to complete the somatic component of any spell you cast, and you treat sawtooth sabres as your divine focus for the casting of divine spells.

1: Crimson Decree (Sp) doom 3/day, death knell 2/day, or blood biography 1/day
2: Blood Scent (Sp) To your heightened olfactory senses, the acrid scent of blood is as pleasing and distinctive as the sweetest perfume. Three times per day, you can cast blood scent (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 143) on yourself as a spell-like ability. This ability does not grant the spell's bonus on attack and damage rolls, even if you are an orc or have a rage ability.
3: Focused Assassin (Su) Your combat skills are just as deadly when you have an assassination target as when you don't. When you perform your obedience for the day, if you are not contracted to kill a target, you can name a single target. You need not know the exact name of your target, but you must know a suitably detailed and correct description, such as "the thieves" guild's second in command.- Against that target, you gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, and you deal an additional 2d6 points of damage. The save DCs of any spells you cast on the target increase by 2. If you are contracted to kill a target, these bonuses apply against that target; if you are contracted to kill multiple targets, you must choose one target against whom these bonuses apply when you perform your obedience.

1: Blood Must Flow (Sp) lead blades 3/day, spiritual weapon 2/day, or keen edge 1/day
2: Bleeding Wounds (Ex) All wounds you inflict with a sawtooth sabre are bleeding wounds, and deal 1d4 points of bleed damage to the target. If you deal bleed damage via another source (such as the bleeding attack rogue talent or by using a wounding sawtooth sabre), this ability does not deal additional bleed damage. You can also use bleed as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day.
3: Mantis Style Mastery (Ex) You take no penalties on attack rolls from two-weapon fighting when wielding two sawtooth sabres simultaneously, and you gain a +2 profane bonus on all damage rolls with sawtooth sabres. If you deal sneak attack damage with a sawtooth sabre, you deal 2 additional points of damage for each die rolled as part of your sneak attack damage. If you have levels in the Red Mantis assassin prestige class (The Inner Sea World Guide 282), the DC for the save against your prayer attack increases by 2.
