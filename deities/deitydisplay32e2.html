Obedience

Spontaneously compose a song whose lyrics consist of a deliciously profane promise you do not intend to keep. If the promise is to another individual, you must perform the song so that person can hear it, but the intentionally disingenuous promise can instead be one you make to yourself (in which case you need not perform it for another). Gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against sonic effects and effects that deal sonic damage.

1: Darkest Muse (Sp) disguise self  3/day, adoration 2/day, or reckless infatuation 1/day
2: Promises Insincere (Sp) Much like Ardad Lili can make mortals see in her presence their fondest desires, you can create an image of yourself to make promises you don't intend to keep or otherwise fool your enemies into doing your bidding. Once per day, you can cast project image as a spell-like ability.
3: Soul-Bound Caress (Sp) Like that of Ardad Lili, your touch results in a much different experience than you might promise. Once per day, you can cast soul bind as a spell-like ability without paying the cost of the required material component. You must still touch the target corpse, however.

Exalted

1: Leveraged Wiles (Sp) innocence  3/day, calm emotions 2/day, or slow 1/day
2: False Innocence (Sp) You have learned much from the ways of this fallen angel, including how to leverage your charms to convince fools to believe almost anything you wish. Three times per day when you are accused of anything, you can use mass suggestion as a spell-like ability. You can use this suggestion to persuade targets that you are innocent, that another is guilty, or that any other statement or insinuation is true. You or an ally must first be accused of some offense before you use this ability, however.
3: From the Mouths of Fools (Sp) In the course of exacting pledges of adoration and fealty from the fools you have tricked in your dark goddess's name, you have amassed memories of begging, wheedling, and other pathetic pleas for your favor. Far from letting this energy go to waste, you can periodically release it in a mighty cacophonous scream. Once per day, you can cast wail of the banshee as a spell-like ability.

Sentinel

1: Selfish Scales (Sp) lock gaze  3/day, chameleon stride 2/day, or burst of nettles 1/day
2: Beware the Forked Tongue (Sp) Just like the Serpent Muse can drop her pretense of innocence when she decides she's had enough of an annoying mortal, you can lash out at your enemies with all the force of Ardad Lili's hatred and wrath. Once per day as a standard action, you can cast mass inflict serious wounds as a spell-like ability.
3: So Speaks the Serpent Muse (Su) When the fury of Ardad Lili is bared, it is an unholy and terrifying sight, and so is it when you display your full might to your foes. Once per day as a standard action, you can speak a profane prayer to your goddess. When you do, each enemy within 60 feet must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or its skin partially turns to scales. This painful process deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 Hit Dice you have, and the target is subject to the effects of a slow spell for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. On a successful saving throw, a target takes only half the damage and negates the slow effect. Creatures need not hear you to be affected, but you must be able to speak to use this ability. This is a polymorph effect.
