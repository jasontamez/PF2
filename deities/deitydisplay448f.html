3: Uncertain Fates (Su) You can keep the spirits of any intelligent creatures that die within 30 feet of you, which orbit you as moaning, disembodied forms. For every spirit you keep, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to AC and caster level checks to overcome spell resistance, but you take a cumulative -1 penalty on Fortitude saving throws. You can keep a number of spirits equal to half your Hit Dice plus your Charisma modifier at one time, but they are released automatically to join the River of Souls if you are stunned, knocked unconscious, or sleeping. As long as you keep the soul of a creature, you can cast <a href="spelldisplayc0c0.html?ItemName=breath%20of%20life">breath of life</a> on it as if that creature had died in the previous round.
