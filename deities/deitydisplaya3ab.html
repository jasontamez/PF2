Obedience

(Deific Obedience) Sacrifice an unwilling living creature in the name of the Mother of Monsters. Draw the process out to inspire the maximum terror and suffering in your victim. The death blow you deal should be savage and destructive-do not grant your sacrifice a clean death. Once the creature is dead, remove one of its bones and sharpen it to a point. Use the bone to cut yourself deeply enough to leave a scar. Leave the sacrificed creature's mutilated form in the open where scavengers may devour it or travelers may see it and know of Lamashtu's power. Gain a +1 natural armor bonus to your AC.

(Demonic Obedience) Engage in a tryst with the sincere intention of being impregnated or impregnating your partner, or sacrifice a creature that has been alive for no more than a week. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saves against insanity, confusion, and polymorph effects.

Nethys Note: See <a href="rulese221.html?Name=Divine%20Gifts&amp;Category=Role%20of%20the%20Divine">here</a> for details on how to gain a Divine Gift
The recipient can disgorge a servitor monster from her body as a full-round action. The monster views the character as its mother and follows her general commands, although it can't be directly controlled. The exact type of monster spawned is chosen by the GM, but is generally one whose CR is equal to the character's level (or in the case of an NPC, the character's own CR). The monster lives for 9 days, after which it dies in a spectacular shower of gore.

1: Savage Summoner (Sp) summon monster I 3/day, summon swarm 2/day, or summon nature's ally III 1/day
2: Terrifying Eidolon (Su) Your eidolon gains the frightful presence evolution for free, if you wish. Whenever you gain a new level in the summoner class (or the evangelist prestige class, if your aligned class has the eidolon class feature) and you reassign your evolution points, you can choose to assign or remove the frightful presence evolution. Once your choice has been made, it can't be altered until the next time you gain an appropriate level. If you don't have the eidolon class feature, you can instead use summon monster V once per day as a spell-like ability.
3: Tainted Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a baregara (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 34). The baregara follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home in the Abyss. The baregara doesn't follow commands that would cause it to act in lawful, good, or otherwise beneficial ways. Such commands not only earn a snarl of disgust from the creature, but could cause the baregara to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.

1: Howling Terror (Sp) cause fear 3/day, mad hallucination 2/day, or fear 1/day
2: Maddening Thoughts (Su) Your mind constantly swirls with dark whispers and disturbing thoughts. You gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting (compulsion) spells and effects and against divination spells and effects that attempt to read your thoughts. Anyone who targets you with such a spell or effect must succeed at a Will saving throw (with a DC equal to 10 + your Wisdom modifier + 1/2 your Hit Dice) or take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage.
3: Monstrous Transformation (Sp) Once per day, you can use baleful polymorph, except you change the target into a horribly mutated form of the chosen animal. The target takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist your spell (if the new form would prove fatal for the creature, it still gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw, effectively negating this penalty). In addition to the other effects of the spell, the subject is in constant pain from its twisted and disfigured form, and takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round. This constant agony imposes a -2 penalty on all of the target's ability checks, skill checks, saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls.

1: Ferocious Battler (Sp) stone fist 3/day, bear's endurance 2/day, or greater magic fang 1/day
2: Bestial Jaws (Ex) Your jaw distends slightly and you grow prominent canines. You gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if you're Medium or 1d3 points of damage if you're Small, plus half your Strength bonus. When part of a full attack, the bite attack is made at your full base attack bonus - 5. You can also make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. This attack is resolved before the grapple check is attempted. If the bite attack hits, you gain a +2 bonus on your grapple check and any other grapple check against the same creature this round.
3: Scarred Form (Su) An armorlike epidermis of thick scars covers you. You take a -2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. You gain damage reduction 5/-. If you already had damage reduction with no method of bypass (such as from the barbarian's damage reduction class feature), you instead increase that damage reduction by 5.

1: Lunatic's Gift (Sp) lesser confusion 3/day, touch of idiocy 2/day, or summon monster III 1/day
2: Teratoma (Ex) You gain a beneficial deformity. Generally, this deformity manifests as a tentacle, tail, claw, or bite that grants you a secondary natural attack dealing 1d6 (1d4 for Small creatures) points of damage. You gain an additional ability depending on the attack chosen as well-this ability can be chosen from the following special attacks: bleed 3, grab, trip, or a 5-foot increase to reach with the natural attack.
3: Third Eye (Su) A third eye opens in your forehead. This eye grants you darkvision to a range of 60 feet (if you already have darkvision, it extends the range of your darkvision by 60 feet) and a +4 profane bonus on Perception checks. Three times per day, you may use a gaze attack that lasts for 1 round; activating this gaze attack is a swift action. This gaze attack has a range of 30 feet, and drives those who fail to resist its effects with a Will save permanently insane, as per the spell insanity (save DC equals 10 + half your HD + your Charisma modifier).

Antipaladin Code

The leaders of Lamashtu's children are proud of their deformities and rage against civilization. They seek to tear the blinders from the eyes of the world and show them the nightmare of nature, the writhing and endlessly fecund truth. Their code is one of bloodshed and howling madness. Its tenets include the following adages. <ul><li>All things are monstrous, and only the weak hide their marks. I show the world as it is.</li><li>I will bring the outcasts in from the cold and teach them the taste of victory.</li><li>I fill the wombs. I birth the children. I teach our enemies why they fear the night.</li><li>I bring madness to the cities, that in their blood and fear they may understand the chaos of the world.</li><li>I will spread the Mother's seed. If the blind cannot be taught to see, their children can.</li></ul>

Divine Fighting Technique



Lamashtu's Carving

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 29</a>
One of the grisliest divine fighting manuals is Fecundity of Corpses, a harrowing tome that depicts the fighting styles favored by the followers of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. In addition to detailing many of the more gruesome rites favored by the Demon Queen, Fecundity of Corpses includes hundreds of techniques recorded in blood by cultists of Lamashtu from across the Inner Sea region. Though no standardized edition of this manual exists because of the cult's discordant hierarchy, each tome manages to perfectly capture similar techniques for sowing fear and blood in Lamashtu's name.

Initial Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a single attack with a falchion or a kukri in order to deal bleed damage to the target. When you make this attack, you do not apply your ability modifier (normally Strength, but potentially other modifiers) to the hit point damage dealt by your attack-instead, add an amount of bleed damage equal to this modifier. The bleeding can be stopped by a successful DC 15 Heal check or any amount of magical healing. Bleed damage from this benefit doesn't stack with itself.

Advanced Prerequisites: Str 13, Dazing Assault, Divine Fighting Technique, Power Attack.

Advanced Benefit: Whenever you hit a bleeding creature with a melee attack using a falchion or a kukri, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or become staggered for 1 round. Multiple attacks do not cause this condition to stack, and a creature that successfully saves against this staggering effect is immune to this effect for 1 round.
