Obedience

Engage in sexual activity with another individual in exchange for money, information, or another valuable resource. This must be a willing act on both your parts; you should not endanger yourself or otherwise enter a situation that makes you uncomfortable. Pray aloud to Calistria before and after the act, and encourage your partner to do the same. If no suitable partner is available, wrap yourself in yellow silk and hold your holy symbol against your chest. Meditate on the teachings of Calistria and fantasize about taking vengeance against one who wronged you. Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with an intelligent creature that could be sexually attracted to you. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience. Once made, this choice can't be changed.

1: Warpsong (Sp) saving finale 3/day, piercing shriek 2/day, or sculpt sound 1/day
2: Shimmering Sting (Sp) Once per day, you can cast rainbow pattern. Rather than appearing as a multitude of colors, this spell manifests as a swarm of shimmering wasps. The wasps shine as brightly as gold and fly in an intricate, mesmerizing pattern. The saving throw DC for this ability is Charisma-based.
3: Vengeful Song (Su) You can reflect a spell targeted against you back at its source with a blast of scornful music. Once per day when you have been specifically targeted by a spell, you may attempt a Perform check as an immediate action. If your Perform check equals or exceeds the spell's save DC, the spell returns immediately to its caster, who must suffer its effects. The caster can attempt a saving throw as normal to negate the returned spell's effects. If the spell normally allows no saving throw, calculate the Perform DC as if the spell did allow a save, taking into account any feats or special abilities the caster may have that would affect the DC. If the spell had multiple targets (for example, a magic missile with three bolts, one of which was targeted at you), you reflect only the portion of the spell targeting you. This ability has no effect on area spells or any spells whose description has no Target entry.

Exalted

1: Calistria's Tongue (Sp) charm person 3/day, eagle's splendor 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Stunning Touch (Su) When using the dazing touch power granted by the Charm domain, you can cause the creature touched to become stunned for 1 round instead of dazed. If you don't have access to the Charm domain, you instead gain the ability to use the dazing touch power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, as listed in the ability; however, you only daze your opponents instead of stunning them.
3: Protective Grace (Ex) You may add your Charisma bonus to your AC while wearing light or no armor. This bonus applies against touch attacks. Any condition that would cause you to lose your Dexterity bonus to AC also causes you to lose your Charisma bonus to AC.

1: Lucky Strike (Sp) divine favor 1/day, align weapon (chaotic only) 2/day, or keen edge 1/day
2: Winsome Lash (Su) You can lash out with your melee weapon as if it were a whip, no matter what the weapon's type truly is. Your melee weapon elongates and grows flexible, gaining an extra 5 feet of reach while still maintaining its ability to strike targets adjacent to you (provided the weapon could normally do so). Using this ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and you can apply this ability only to melee weapons. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). The rounds don't need to be consecutive, and activating and deactivating the ability is a free action.
3: Sting Like a Wasp (Ex) For a number of rounds per day equal to your Charisma bonus, you can ignore attacks of opportunity you would otherwise provoke due to your movement. Using this ability is a free action, and the rounds in which you use it don't need to be consecutive. You still provoke attacks of opportunity normally for actions other than moving.

Antipaladin Code

Antipaladins of Calistria do not demand great things of others, but rather seek to emulate the Savored Sting in their manner. Most are women; their ranks are filled with those devoted to bloody vengeance and the shining lusts that spark it. Their tenets include the following adages. <ul><li>My life is my path, and none will sway me from it.</li><li>I devote myself to the pursuit of my passions.</li><li>I take what I desire, by trick or by force. If others resent my actions, they may attempt to take vengeance against me.</li><li>All slights against me will be repaid tenfold.</li><li>I am the instrument of my own justice. If I am wronged, I will take vengeance with my own hands.</li></ul>
