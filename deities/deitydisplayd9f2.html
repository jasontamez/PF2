Boons - Nascent Demon Lords
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 124</a>
With very few exceptions, a demon lord is never born fully formed. Instead, each must build power and resources during an extended period of transformation. Demons in this transitional stage are known as nascent demon lords.

At any one time, there exist hundreds-if not thousands' of nascent demon lords in the Abyss. Those who have been associated with the Inner Sea region are summarized here. All nascent demon lords are chaotic evil and range in power from CR 21 to CR 25. The boons they grant are less complex than those granted by demon lords, manifesting as spell-like abilities usable twice per day each.

1:  create pit
2:  phantasmal killer
3:  harm
