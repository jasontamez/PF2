Boons - Rakshasa Immortals</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 131</a>
Once in a great while, a rakshasa achieves a purity of evil that allows it to break free from the cycle of death and reincarnation and transcend its own mortality. The power of such rakshasas approaches that of the gods they think they are.

Unlike the other pantheons described in this book, the rakshasa immortals do not present themselves as having traditional areas of concern, for each of these immortals is concerned primarily with its own glory and power. And while each rakshasa immortal has its own unique appearance and personality, they have little interest in diversification among their faithful. All rakshasa immortals grant access to the same domains (Animal, Evil, Law, and Trickery), the same subdomains (Deception, Fear [see page 180], Fur, and Tyranny [see page 182]), and the same favored weapon (kukri).

All rakshasa immortals are lawful evil and range in power from CR 21 to CR 25. The boons they grant are less complex than those granted by other fiendish demigods, manifesting as spell-like abilities usable twice per day each.
