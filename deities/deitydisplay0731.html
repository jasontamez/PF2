Obedience

Spend an hour practicing sword forms beneath the sun. Meditate in silence as you practice, focusing on executing each form more perfectly with each repetition. At the end of your practice, make an offering to your ancestors, and vow that your deeds in the day to come will honor their memory. Gain a +2 sacred bonus to confirm critical hits with any one sword for the next 24 hours. You can use this chosen sword as your divine focus to cast divine spells.

1: Radiant Warrior (Sp) <a href="spelldisplayebed.html?ItemName=bless">bless</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay0a32.html?ItemName=blinding%20ray">blinding ray</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplaya67c.html?ItemName=searing%20light">searing light</a> 1/day
2: Smite Darkness (Su) Three times per day, when a creature casts a darkness spell or uses a darkness-creating ability within 30 feet of you, you can call upon Shizuru's guiding light to block it. Attempt a check (1d20 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) against the dispel DC of the spell as an immediate action. If you succeed, the target spell or effect fails and is wasted; otherwise, it is unaffected.
3: Channel Heaven's Fury (Su) Three times per day as a free action, you can call upon Shizuru's might to imbue either a damaging spell or a weapon strike with a blinding burst of sunlight, which causes it to deal positive energy damage instead of its normal damage type. You must declare the use of this ability before rolling to attack or casting the spell, and if the attack or spell fails, the ability is wasted. This positive energy damage does not heal living creatures.

Exalted

1: Guardian of the Ancestors (Sp) <a href="spelldisplayfc05.html?ItemName=sanctify%20corpse">sanctify corpse</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplayc2fb.html?ItemName=restoration,%20lesser">lesser restoration</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay0970.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20dead">speak with dead</a> 1/day
2: Release Death's Grip (Su) Your touch bolsters the living against the terrors of undeath. As a standard action, you can touch someone afflicted with the dazed, paralyzed, sickened, staggered, or stunned condition and grant that creature another saving throw to resist the effect. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time per day for every three Hit Dice you have (maximum 6 times per day).
3: Return to the Grave (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, you can call upon Shizuru's glory to help you return an undead creature to the grave. The chosen undead must be within 60 feet. The undead must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or suffer a flurry of shining sword slashes across its body, which gradually fade over the duration of this effect. The undead loses either its damage resistance or its spell resistance (choose one) for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20 rounds). Additionally, if the undead is unable to rest because of some grievance or trauma, you become aware of what that is, and how you might address it to give the soul peace.

Sentinel

2: Dazzling Grace (Su) As a free action, you can surround yourself with a glowing nimbus of sunlight that shines bright light within 60 feet. While so illuminated, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity. Enemies who attempt such attacks against you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) or be dazzled for 1d4 rounds. This does not affect sightless foes. You can maintain this glowing nimbus for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20 rounds). The rounds in which you manifest the nimbus don't need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss it as a free action.
3: Swordmaster of the Sun (Su) Once per day as a free action when fighting with any sword, you can cause your blade to glow with increasingly bright golden radiance after every blow you land. After each hit, you gain a +1 sacred bonus on the damage rolls for subsequent blows, cumulative up to a total equal to your Hit Dice. This damage bonus lasts for the duration of the combat or for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 minute), whichever is lower. This effect applies only to a single sword; if you fight with two or more weapons, your other weapons are unaffected.

Paladin Code

Much of Shizuru's paladin code overlaps with the warrior code of ichimeiyo, which is so closely aligned with the goddess's tenets that those outside the faith may perceive no distinction between them. In addition to the tenets of ichimeiyo, the Empress of Heaven's paladins are expected to obey the following precepts. <ul><li>Both my sword and my swordplay have been entrusted to me by those who have mastered their craft, and both deserve to be wielded by a skilled hand. My training will be consistent, and I will impart my training to others, as others passed my training down to me. </li><li>I will honor the ancestors who have come before me and provided for my life. </li><li>Though the bonds of love extend across any distance, I will not stretch them further by separating lovers. </li><li>The Empress rules all under Heaven. I am a guardian of the land and its health, as well as of civilized empires that live upon it. I will defend nature from the twisted influence of undead and aberrations, and seek mutual peace with creatures that defend nature from humanity. </li><li>My personal conduct reflects on my family and my god; I will conscientiously maintain my reputation for the sake of theirs, even on the battlefield. </li><li>The strategy of war involves deception by nature, but the flag of peace is sacrosanct. I accept no negotiations from those who have attacked a foe under the pretense of arbitration or truce for their own gain; they have destroyed the trust that reconciliation requires.</li></ul>
