1: Kiss of the Grave (Sp) deathwatch 3/day, ghoul touch 2/day, or speak with dead 1/day
2: Undead Minion (Sp) You can cast create undead once per day. The undead that is created obeys you without question. If you use this ability to create a new undead minion, the previous undead is destroyed.
3: Ghoulish Apotheosis (Ex) The next time you die, you rise as a ghoul after 24 hours. Your type changes to undead and you lose all the abilities of your previous race, replacing them with +2 natural armor, darkvision 60 feet, channel resistance +2, and a ghoul's physical attacks. You do not change your total Hit Dice or alter your ability scores. If you achieve this boon when you're already an undead creature, you instead gain a +4 profane bonus to Charisma.

Boons - [Fiendish Obedience](feat:FiendishObedience)

Evangelist

1: Shadow of Death (Sp) chill touch  3/day, gentle repose 2/day, or assume appearance 1/day
2: Corpse Communion (Sp) You can rifle through the minds of the dead in search of forbidden knowledge or lost lore. Three times per day, you can touch a corpse of any age to gain knowledge from it as a standard action. This works similarly to speak with dead, except that you receive all answers immediately and telepathically (removing the need for the body to have intact vocal structures) and the dead creature gains no saving throw against this effect, regardless of its alignment. If you take the time to consume a significant portion of the corpse, you can ask two additional questions. This option increases the casting time to 10 minutes. Of course, regardless of the method by which you choose to commune with the corpse, the body might not hold the knowledge you seek, and once you use this ability on a dead body, you can't use it again on the same body again in the future.
3: Lore of the Countless Dead (Sp) Your hunger for forbidden knowledge allows you to tap into the collective spellcraft of all the multiverse's innumerable dead, a repository of arcana stretching back to the dawn of time. Once per day as a standard action, you can cast any spell of 7th level or lower, as if using wish to cast another spell. This is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell, and any DCs and other effects are calculated as a 9th-level spell, regardless of the spell's normal level.

Exalted

1: Kiss of the Grave (Sp) deathwatch  3/day, ghoul touch 2/day, or speak with dead 1/day
2: Undead Minion (Sp) Worship of Kabriri has revealed to you secret methods by which you can coax unlife from rotten flesh and old bones. You can cast create undead as a spell-like ability twice per day. The undead created obey you without question. You can have only one such minion active at a time; if you use this ability to create a new undead minion, the previous undead is destroyed.
3: Ghoulish Apotheosis (Ex) For you, death is not an ending but a beginning. The next time you die, you rise as a ghoul after 24 hours. Your type changes to undead and you lose all the abilities of your previous race, replacing them with a +2 natural armor bonus, darkvision 60 feet, channel resistance +2, and a ghoul's physical attacks. You do not change your total Hit Dice or alter your ability scores. If you achieve this boon when you're already an undead creature, you instead gain a +4 profane bonus to your Charisma score.

Sentinel

1: Charnel Pits (Sp) expeditious excavation  3/day, create pit 2/day, or stinking cloud 1/day
2: Ghoulish Hungers (Ex) You hunger for the flesh of the dead... and the living. You gain a bite attack that deals damage appropriate for your size (1d6 if you're Medium). Any creature damaged by your bite attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or become infected with ghoul fever. The save DC of this ghoul fever is equal to 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier (or your Charisma modifier, if you have no Constitution score).
3: Undertaker (Sp) With nothing but your will alone, you can slaughter and entomb your foes in one fell swoop. Once per day, you can cast finger of death as a spell-like ability. Any creature killed by this effect is immediately entombed 6 feet underground within a 6-inch-thick stone sarcophagus, along with its gear. One week after interment, a creature entombed by this ability breaks free from its sarcophagus as a chaotic evil ghast with all class levels it had in life; these ghasts are not under your control, but are often friendly toward you.

Other Rules

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 55</a>
When using <a href="spelldisplay03d4.html?ItemName=Create%20Undead">create undead</a>, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can create a ghul or great ghul from the corpse of a genie rather than creating a mummy (minimum caster level 15th). When creating a ghoul, ghast, ghul, or great ghul with this spell, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can also apply the fiendish template to that creature. This requires the caster to double the normal material component cost or sacrifice a living humanoid as an additional material component of casting the spell.
