Obedience

Under the night sky, offer prayers to the moon. On nights when there is no moon, you must supplement your prayers by sacrificing a living creature by tearing out its throat with your teeth and feeding on the still-warm body. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws attempted when the moon is visible in the night sky.

2: Afflicted Lycanthrope (Su) You contract lycanthropy and become a werewolf (even if you normally couldn't gain that template). If you are already a werewolf, you become a true lycanthrope. If you are already a true lycanthrope, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution.
3: True Lycanthrope (Su) You can use your lycanthropic change shape ability as a swift action. You become a true lycanthrope if you were an afflicted lycanthrope. If you are already a true lycanthrope, you gain another +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution.

1: Moonshadow (Sp) keen senses  3/day, darkness 2/day, or rage 1/day
2: Lunatic Potency (Su) The light of the moon fills your spells with maddening power and opens your heart to pure and primal rage. The DC of spells and spell-like abilities you cast under the light of the moon increase by 1, and you are healed of an amount of damage equal to the spell's level as the spell is cast. During nights of the full moon, spells with the fear or emotion descriptor have their save DCs increased by 2 and you are healed of an amount of damage equal to twice the spell's level when you cast such a spell.
3: Howl at the Moon (Su) You take on the aspect of the wolf- you become more rugged, your ears become elongated, and you sprout sharp fangs and fur. You gain a +2 profane bonus to your Strength, the scent ability, and a +4 bonus on trip combat maneuvers checks. You gain a bite natural attack that deals damage appropriate to your size (1d6 if you are Medium). As a swift action or whenever you hit with a bite attack, you can attempt combat maneuver to trip your foe; this trip attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
