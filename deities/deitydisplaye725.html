1: Maledictions (Sp) <a href="spelldisplaycc80.html?ItemName=bane">bane</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay8cc2.html?ItemName=blindness/deafness">blindness/deafness</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay6c8d.html?ItemName=bestow%20curse">bestow curse</a> 1/day
2: Ill Luck (Su) As a swift action, you can activate or deactivate a 5-foot-radius aura of unluck. A creature in the area when the aura is active must roll attack rolls and skill checks twice and take the worse result. A creature benefiting from a luck bonus is immune to this aura. You can use this aura for a total number of rounds per day equal to your Charisma modifier.
3: Transfer Curse (Su) Once per day, you can touch a creature that is affected by a curse effect or a spell with the curse descriptor and attempt to remove a single curse as the <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> spell (treat your total Hit Dice as your caster level). You then hold the energy of that curse in your hand, as if you were holding the charge on a spell. With a successful touch attack, you can place that curse on another creature. The new target attempts the same saving throw as the original curse effect; if it fails, it is subject to the curse and the curse's duration (if any) resets. Attempts to remove this transferred curse with a <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> spell use your total Hit Dice as the new caster level.

2: Shrivel Limbs (Su) Three times per day, you can make a touch attack to cause a living creature's arms and legs to temporarily wither unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your total Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). An affected creature counts as one size category smaller for the purpose of determining the size of weapons it can wield. If the creature is capable of making natural attacks with its arms, hands, or claws, the damage dealt by those attacks decreases as though the target were one size category smaller than its actual size. In addition, the creature's base speed decreases by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) and its Strength score counts as 4 lower for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity. After 24 hours, the creature's limbs return to normal. This is a curse effect.
3: Contagious Curse (Sp) You can cast <a href="spelldisplay6a2b.html?ItemName=conditional%20curse">conditional curse</a> as a spell-like ability once per day. The condition you dictate to remove the curse must involve the target manipulating the flesh of two other creatures in some manner (such as removing a limb or organ, or grafting on an additional facial feature). Each creature whose flesh the target manipulates in this manner must also succeed at a saving throw at the same DC as your <a href="spelldisplay6a2b.html?ItemName=conditional%20curse">conditional curse</a> or be affected in the same way as the first target, with the same condition to remove the curse.

2: Corrupted Nature (Sp) You can cast <a href="spelldisplay41c0.html?ItemName=animal%20aspect">animal aspect</a> as a spell-like ability three times per day. The body parts you chose to alter are twisted and horrific to behold, though they provide the normal benefits of the spell.
3: Monstrous Form (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can will your body to reshape itself, though this metamorphosis is incredibly taxing. You gain a +2 profane bonus to any two of your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores and gain DR 5/- for 10 minutes. After this ends, you are fatigued for 1 minute.

Boons - Qlippoth Lords
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 129</a>
Qlippoth lords are always chaotic evil and range in power from CR 21 to CR 25. It's quite likely that more powerful creatures akin to demigods in stature may still exist in the deepest parts of the Abyss, but such qlippoth demigods remain theoretical for now, and they do not maintain active cults on mortal worlds. The boons qlippoth lords grant are less complex than those granted by fiendish demigods, manifesting as spell-like abilities usable twice per day each.

1:  alter self
2:  bestow curse
3:  extended polymorph
