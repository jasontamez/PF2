Paladin Code

Andoletta's paladins serve courts and other authorities. They seek to protect innocence and dispel foolishness. Their tenets include the following affirmations.<ul><li> Children must be nurtured lest their innocence become callousness or ignorance. I will never be cold or negligent to a child.</li><li> Virtue relies upon wisdom, and wisdom relies upon true awareness. I will never leave a falsehood unchallenged.</li><li> I will be firm with the ignorant, but not cruel. Ignorance can be corrected.</li><li> I will respect my elders' knowledge and wisdom, but won't abide the spreading of complacency or ignorance.</li></ul>
