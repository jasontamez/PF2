Obedience

Meditate on the sensations of starving to death in the snow; you need not actually be starving or in the snow to do so, but for each of these conditions you lack, you must deal 1d4 points of damage to yourself via self-flagellation. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against cold-based effects.

Boons - Oni Daimyo
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 127</a>
The most powerful oni, the oni daimyo, hold their domains in isolated regions of the Material Plane. While they have transcended their lesser incarnations to become something close to demigods in stature, they do not flaunt their power and prefer to dwell in remote corners of the massive land of Tian Xia.

Oni daimyo are always evil in alignment but can be chaotic, lawful, or neutral. They range in power from CR 21 to CR 25. The boons they grant are less complex than those granted by fiendish demigods, manifesting as spell-like abilities usable twice per day each.
