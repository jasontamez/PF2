Obedience

Sharpen a blade with 603 strokes-one for each year the Erinyes Queen wandered existence, building glorious hatred in her heart-repeating prayers to Eiseth for the duration. Gain a +1 profane bonus to attacks against a single type of creature, chosen each time you perform this obedience. If you choose humanoids or outsiders, you must choose an associated subtype.

1: Dark Wings of Vengeance (Sp) murderous command 3/day, death knell 2/day, or excruciating deformation 1/day
2: Erinyes Legion (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can call down a shower of erinyes' flaming arrows in a 40-foot-radius area centered anywhere within 400 feet of your position. Each creature in the area takes 3d6 points of fire damage and 3d6 points of evil-aligned damage and is then staggered for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) takes half damage and negates the staggered condition.
3: Fallen Angel's Return (Sp) The might and fury of a vengeful Eiseth standing against her foes is a terrible sight to behold. Once per day, you can create an overwhelming image of Hell's Valkyrie storming the gates of Heaven to annex her long-deserved dark queendom. This ability functions as per weird.

Exalted

1: 603 Years of Wrath (Sp) ear-piercing scream 3/day, badger's ferocity 2/day, or fireball 1/day
2: Descent of Hell's Valkyrie (Sp) When Eiseth beats her mighty wings in unholy wrath, all take notice-and you know how to harness this power to aid you in battle. Once per day, you can cast scouring winds as a spell-like ability. Instead of sand, the storm conjures clouds of fiery ash, and it deals fire damage instead of piercing damage.
3: The Furies Unleashed (Sp) Once per day, you can summon five erinyes to your side to fight on your behalf. This functions as summon monster IX. When an erinyes is defeated or the effect's duration has expired, a cloak of the blackest night heralds the erinyes's return to Dis, creating a 10-foot-radius sphere of darkness (as per deeper darkness) for 1 round, centered on the erinyes's last position.

Sentinel

1: Dark Battle Rising (Sp) true strike  3/day, flame blade 2/day, or force hook charge 1/day
2: Swords of the Ash Wings (Su) Three times per day when you successfully strike an enemy, you can infuse your blow with the weight of Eiseth's dark fury as a swift action. When you do, your attack deals an additional 4d6 points of fire damage and 4d6 points of slashing damage as flaming swords from the depths of Hell bite into your opponent's body. This damage is considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This additional damage is never doubled upon a critical hit.
3: The Dark Queen Marches (Sp) When she focuses her terrible wrath on a single goal, the Erinyes Queen is a force of unbelievable power. You have studied Eiseth's tactics carefully and can imitate them to advance your goddess's dark glory. Once per day, you can cast ride the lightning as a spell-like ability. Instead of a lightning bolt, though, you transform into a streak of lava, so this ability deals fire damage instead of electricity damage.
