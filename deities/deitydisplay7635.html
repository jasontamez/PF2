Obedience

Preach of the coming end times to a listener who has not yet accepted this truth. If the person leaves or otherwise refuses to listen to you for the full hour, you must find another person to preach to so that you are proselytizing the entire time. Alternatively, if no one at all is available to listen, spend an hour contemplating ways and times the world might end-do so in an empty place where nothing lives and no person except Groetan worshipers have been for at least a month. While you contemplate, deface any surface available to you with unholy images and symbols, such as a skull-like moon. You then gain a +1 sacred or profane bonus on Will saving throws. The type of bonus depends on your alignment- if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

1: Doomsayer (Sp) doom 3/day, augury 2/day, or bestow curse 1/day
2: Consume Essence (Su) As Groetus will one day consume all existence, so do you seek to consume other mortals. Once per day, you can consume the essence of a dead creature. You must touch the target corpse, which can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If it fails this saving throw, the target is destroyed as per disintegrate, and you gain 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for a number of hours equal to your Hit Dice.
3: Whispers of Insanity (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can whisper an insight gleaned from Groetus to shatter the mind of another creature within 30 feet. The target must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If it fails, the target is driven mad by thoughts and concepts far beyond what the brain can handle, as if the workings of Thassilonian magic were revealed to a common ant; it is affected as if by the insanity spell. In addition to the normal ways to remove this spell, this ability's maddening thoughts can be removed using modify memory. A successful Knowledge (religion) check (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) reveals this additional way to negate the effect.

1: Maddening Voice (Sp) lesser confusion 3/day, mad hallucination 2/day, or confusion 1/day
2: Silent Witness (Su) Emulating Groetus, you can observe your surroundings and the people within them without being heeded or harmed. Once per day as a full-round action, you can protect yourself with the effects of invisibility, nondetection, and sanctuary for 10 minutes per Hit Die you possess. Anyone who succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or a caster level check (DC = 11 + your Hit Dice) against these effects sees a glimpse of something unfathomable and becomes confused for 1 round unless it succeeds at a second Will save with the same DC.
3: Infinite Patience (Su) You will serve Groetus until the end of the world, no matter how long you must wait. You cannot die of old age, even by magical means, although aging otherwise affects you normally. In addition, once per day as a standard action, you can choose any one action you could ready and define a condition under which you will take that action. Within the next 24 hours, whenever you observe that condition, you can take the chosen action as an immediate action.

1: Endbringer (Sp) true strike 3/day, death knell 2/day, or keen edge 1/day
2: Visions of the End (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, you can gain a sudden vision of a target's doom. You gain the benefits of augury, know the enemy, and locate weakness simultaneously, all regarding the same creature or object (even if the spell normally doesn't function with objects) and its death or undoing. You can use the locate weakness effect on only the target creature.
3: Frightful Presence (Su) You have looked into oblivion, and its horrors are reflected in your eyes. You can terrify foes as a free action whenever you take an offensive action, such as attacking. Foes within 30 feet of you and with fewer Hit Dice than you must succeed at a Will saving throw or become shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If the victim has 4 or fewer Hit Dice, it becomes panicked instead. Foes with more Hit Dice than you are immune to this ability.
