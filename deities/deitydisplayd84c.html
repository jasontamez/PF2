1: Plague's Blessing (Sp) ray of sickening  3/day, blindness/ deafness 2/day, or contagion 1/day
2: Plague Breath (Sp) You can cast plague storm twice per day as a spell-like ability.
3: Fallow Flesh (Ex)  Infused with Apollyon's grace, you are immune to the negative effects of disease, yet you can still carry diseases in your body and infect others with them. Disease effects you create take effect at once, with the first day of damage happening immediately; the disease then progresses as normal. The saving throw DCs of disease effects you generate increase by 1, and victims can't recover from those effects naturally through rest; only magic can cure the diseases you create (although those who contract a disease from someone you infect treat the disease as normal). Any creature that is immune to disease as a result of a class feature or a nonartifact magic item is not immune to disease effects you create, but it gains a +4 bonus on its saving throw to resist the disease. Any creature that is immune to disease via a racial feature or as a feature of its creature type remains immune to your diseases.

1: Plague's Grace (Sp)  diagnose disease  3/day, summon swarm 2/day, or vermin shape I 1/day
2: Breath of Flies (Su) Once per minute as a standard action (up to three times a day), you can exhale a cloud of biting, corpse-bloated black flies in a 20-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take 8d6 points of slashing damage. A victim can reduce this damage by half with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier), but any creature that takes any damage at all from this effect is sickened for 1 minute. The cloud of flies lingers for 1d4+1 rounds, congealing into a buzzing, 20-foot-square cloud centered on the cone's original point of origin. A creature that ends its turn in this cloud must succeed at a Reflex save or take 4d6 points of slashing damage and be sickened for 1 minute. Any area effect that deals damage or creates strong or stronger wind disperses this cloud. You are immune to the effects of these flies, as are all daemons.
3: Flood of Vermin (Sp) You can cast empowered creeping doom as a spell-like ability once per day. You are immune to swarm attacks.

Sentinel

1: Plague's Crusader (Sp) mount  3/day, wartrain mount 2/ day, or phantom steed 1/day
2: Contagious Strike (Sp) Up to three times per day as a swift action, you can cause a creature damaged by a ranged or melee weapon you wield to become affected by contagion.
3: Usher of Apollyon (Su) As a swift action, you can summon into your hands either a +4 unholy wounding scythe or a +4 adaptive distance unholy longbow, lasting for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier. This weapon vanishes if you release it, and the rounds of use need not be consecutive.
