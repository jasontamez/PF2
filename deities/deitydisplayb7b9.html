Obedience

Meditate while allowing insects or worms of any type to crawl upon your body-if no such vermin is available, you must instead lie facedown in a trench dug into soil and mouth prayers to Deskari into the dirt while scratching yourself with sharp bits of bone or wood. Gain a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against disease and against effects caused by vermin.

1: Locusts' Gifts (Sp) jump  3/day, acid arrow 2/day, or fly 1/day
2: Avatar of the Locust Host (Sp) You can cast verminous transformation as a spell-like ability once per day; the swarming parts of your body are comprised of locusts, and your swarm attack deals double damage to plant creatures.
3: Infestation of Flesh (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can take the form of a hellwasp swarm for up to 8 hours. You gain swarm traits (including immunity to weapon damage) and a swarm attack. You also gain the distraction, inhabit, and poison special attacks. While in this form, you cannot perform any actions that the swarm could not perform; this includes casting spells with somatic components and wielding weapons or items. While not using the swarm's inhabit ability, you can return to your normal form as a full-round action. This is a polymorph effect.

1: Split the Earth (Sp) stumble gap  3/day, create pit 2/day, or spiked pit 1/day
2: Planar Wound (Su) You can cut through the fabric of reality, delivering foes to your master's embrace. Three times per day as a standard action, you can strike the ground with a scythe to open a fissure under your feet or the feet of an adjacent Medium or smaller creature (if you target yourself, the rift opens just enough to let you-and only you-through, regardless of your size). This fissure is a planar rift that sends the creature to the Rasping Rifts in the Abyss, as per plane shift, except the fissure can transport only one creature and closes instantly after doing so (or after being avoided). An unwilling target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to evade the fissure and negate this effect. Flying and levitating creatures are immune to this effect, and a creature capable of flight that is standing on the ground can avoid this effect if it succeeds at a DC 20 Fly check (it can still attempt a Reflex save to avoid the spell if it fails this Fly check).
3: Welcome the Rasping Rifts (Sp) You can cast rift of ruin once per day as a spell-like ability. When the rift closes, each creature still present within the rift must attempt a Will save (against the spell's save DC). Creatures that succeed at this save are expelled violently (as normal for the spell), while those that fail are expelled violently into the Rasping Rifts in the Abyss. If you close the rift early to summon creatures, you summon one additional creature of the same type.
