Obedience

Dress yourself in the heaviest set of metal armor you own. Shout your oath of loyalty to Gorum at the top of your lungs, punctuating each pause for breath by smashing your weapon against a shield or against your armor-clad body. After your oath is done, kneel on one knee with your weapon resting against your shoulder. Recite your victories in battle in a sonorous voice until the time for your obedience is done. If you should be attacked while conducting your obedience, slay the creature who dared test your might. (You may be assisted by allies, but you must strike the killing blow.) Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Strength checks and Strengthbased skill checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

1: Weaponsmith (Sp) crafter's fortune 3/day, fox's cunning 2/day, or greater magic weapon 1/day
2: War Mount (Ex) If you make a full attack while mounted, your mount also attacks with great enthusiasm. You must attempt a Ride check as normal to fight with a combat-trained mount. If your Ride check succeeds, your mount can attack with a +4 bonus on its attack and damage rolls.
3: Chaotic Charge (Ex) Three times per day, you can make a chaotic charge attack while mounted. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. You take an extra -2 penalty to AC in addition to the normal AC penalty for charging, but you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage to creatures of lawful alignment on a successful mounted charge. If you have the cavalier's charge, mighty charge, or supreme charge class ability, you instead deal an extra 3d6 points of damage to creatures of lawful alignment on a successful wild charge and don't take the AC penalty.

Exalted

1: Battler (Sp) magic stone 3/day, spiritual weapon 2/day, or deadly juggernaut 1/day
2: Mass Strength Surge (Su) When using the strength surge granted power from the Strength domain, you can target allies within 30 feet of you instead of having to touch a single target. You can target a maximum number of allies equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6). If you don't have access to the Strength domain, you instead gain the ability to use the strength surge granted power a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, as listed in the strength surge description. However, you can touch only a single target when using this granted power.
3: Gorum's Shout (Sp) Once per day, you can use word of chaos as a spell-like ability. In order to use this ability, you must shout a battle cry at top volume, ending your shout in praise to Gorum.

Sentinel

1: Mighty Warrior (Sp) enlarge person 3/day, bull's strength 2/day, or beast shape I 1/day
2: Two-Handed Smash (Ex) If you make a full attack while wielding a two-handed melee weapon, you may make a single unarmed strike in addition to your normal attacks. In essence, after you complete your two-handed weapon attacks, you smash with your elbow, kick out with a foot, or make some other unarmed strike against an opponent. This bonus attack is made at your highest base attack bonus, and provokes an attack of opportunity if you lack the Improved Unarmed Strike feat or a similar ability. If you're Medium, you deal 1d6 points of damage with this unarmed strike; if you're Small, you deal 1d4 points of damage. Add half your Strength bonus to the damage dealt. The attack roll for the unarmed strike is subject to the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting unless you have the feats to reduce these penalties.
3: Devout Rage (Ex) You enter a holy or unholy frenzy whenever you rage, depending on your alignment. You gain a +2 bonus on your attack and damage rolls while raging. If you don't have the rage class feature, you can fly into a rage once per day as the rage spell, though you don't need to concentrate. Instead, the rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice or until you choose to end it, whichever comes first.

Divine Fighting Technique



Gorum's Swordmanship

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdy?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Weapon-Masters-Handbook">Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 11</a>
Gorum teaches devastating greatsword techniques.

Optional Replacement: A chaotic neutral barbarian or fighter who worships Gorum can replace a bonus feat or rage power with the following initial benefit.

Initial Benefit: If you have the Vital Strike feat, you can apply its effect to an attack you make with a greatsword at the end of a charge. If you don't have the Vital Strike feat, that attack deals 1 additional point of damage instead. The first time you make an attack of opportunity with a greatsword after using Vital Strike with a greatsword on your turn, you can apply Vital Strike to that attack of opportunity.

Advanced Prerequisites: Str 13, Cleave, Power Attack, Vital Strike, base attack bonus +10.

Optional Replacement: A chaotic neutral barbarian or fighter of at least 10th level who worships Gorum can replace a bonus feat or rage power with the following advanced benefit, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites.

Advanced Benefit: When you use Vital Strike, Improved Vital Strike, or Greater Vital Strike with a greatsword, the damage counts as continuous damage from an injury for the purpose of determining whether a target must attempt a concentration check to cast spells (Core Rulebook 206).

Other Rules

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/adventurePath/kingmaker/v5748btpy8b7u">Pathfinder #35: War of the River Kings pg. 73</a>
Followers are forbidden from casting the <a href="spelldisplayfd5f.html?ItemName=Rusting%20Grasp">rusting grasp</a> spell. Druids are permitted to wear metal armor, though they do not automatically gain proficiency in any other categories of armor. They cannot cast spells while wearing metal armor, nor does it meld with them when they use wild shape; druids interested in metal armor acquire a set for a specific beast form and have allies or slaves put it on them when it is time to fight.
