Obedience

Using a ruby-bladed knife, inscribe symmetrical cuts into the flesh of another creature-preferably an unwilling sentient being you own or hold dominion over. The blade may be solid ruby or forged of metal and edged with serrated ruby fragments. Devout priests of Asmodeus take pride in crafting elaborate daggers made entirely of ruby. Drain the victim's blood into a bowl of bone made from the skull of a sentient humanoid. The amount of blood drained is up to you; you don't have to drain so much that you make the creature weak or too useless to serve you. Use the bowl of blood to draw a large pentagram on the ground. Kneel within the pentagram and concentrate on the glory you will bring to the Prince of Darkness's name. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against fire effects.

Asmodeus grants the service of a devil to aid in a specific task (which can last no longer than 9 nights). The type of devil is generally one whose CR is equal to the character's level (or in the case of an NPC, the character's CR).

1: Pitiless Judgment (Sp) wrath 3/day, flames of the faithful 2/day, or bestow curse 1/day
2: Tireless Judgment (Ex) You gain Favored Judgment as a bonus feat, choosing chaotic outsider, good outsider, or a subtype of humanoid. If you don't have the judgment class feature, you instead gain a +4 profane bonus on Survival checks made to track a creature or individual. This boon doesn't grant you any ranks in the Survival skill; therefore, if you have no ranks, you still can follow tracks only if the DC of the task is 10 or lower.
3: Resounding Judgment (Sp) Once per day, you can channel the effects of resounding blow through your weapon, though you don't need to cast (or even know) the spell. You must declare your use of this ability before you make the attack roll. On a hit, the target is affected as if you had cast resounding blow before your attack, and the surrounding area rings with the sound of vicious, booming laughter. You don't gain the stunning effect of the spell unless you have access to the judgment or smite ability. If your attack misses, the resounding blow effect is wasted.

1: Darkfire (Sp) burning hands 3/day, darkness 2/day, or deeper darkness 1/day
2: Embersight (Su) Your eyes take on the appearance of red-hot, glowing embers, granting you the ability to see in darkness much like devils. You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you chose either darkness or deeper darkness as the spell-like ability granted by your first boon, you can also see perfectly through both darkness and deeper darkness. If you already have darkvision to a range of 60 feet or more, instead increase the range of your darkvision by 10 feet. Your eyes make you extremely distinctive, causing you to take a -4 penalty on Disguise checks.
3: Hellfire Blast (Sp) You can use delayed blast fireball once per day as a spell-like ability to throw a sphere of soulscouring hellfire. The hellfire is a distinctive mixture of black and crimson flames in which screaming devilish faces can be seen twisting and writhing. Half the damage from this spell is fire, while the other half is unholy. This damage modification applies only to the delayed blast fireball you create through this boon, not to any other spells, effects, or attacks.

1: Unholy Warrior (Sp) protection from good 3/day, death knell 2/day, or defile armor 1/day
2: Deceitful Duelist (Ex) Your devotion to the Prince of Darkness has imbued you with some of his trickery. Three times per day, you can attempt a feint as a swift action. You gain a +4 profane bonus on your Bluff check when attempting to feint using this ability. If you successfully attack a creature that has lost its Dexterity bonus to AC as a result of your feint, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This is in addition to any other precision-based damage you deal'such as from a sneak attack-and isn't multiplied on a critical hit.
3: Diabolical Resistances (Su) Your dark patron rewards your faith with a few drops of devilish blood in your veins, granting you a measure of the resilience enjoyed by devilkind. Your skin takes on a ruddy cast, and your teeth grow slightly sharper. To a casual observer you may look no different, but anyone who studies you closely notices these traits. You gain fire resistance 10 and a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against poison.

Divine Fighting Technique



Asmodeus's Mandate

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 28</a>
Although soldiers and mercenaries alike in Cheliax claim that the martial techniques detailed within Wrath and Punishment, the most well-known fighting manual of the Church of Asmodeus, are as old as time itself, martial experts across the Inner Sea region note that Wrath and Punishment is less than 3 decades old. Of course, few in Cheliax dare to publicly make such claims. Outside of Cheliax, copies of Wrath and Punishment tend to be found in Hellknight enclaves.

Initial Benefit: Whenever you threaten a critical hit with a light mace or heavy mace on a foe, that foe becomes sickened for 1 round. If you confirm the critical hit, the sickened effect lasts for 2 rounds. The duration of the sickened effect doesn't stack with multiple critical threats.

Advanced Prerequisites: Int 13; Combat Expertise; Divine Fighting Technique; Improved Feint; base attack bonus +10 or Bluff 10 ranks.

Advanced Benefit: An opponent that you hit with a light mace or heavy mace who is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC is also hindered by the attack. You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check as a swift action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity immediately after damage from the attack is resolved.
