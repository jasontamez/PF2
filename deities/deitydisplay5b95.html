Obedience

Practice the Divine Experiment by following the procedure to transmute lead into gold; this process normally requires a philosopher's stone, but for this obedience, the thaumaturge can substitute any material for lead-it's not the actual transmutation that functions as the obedience, but the act of going through the motions. Gain a +4 profane bonus against transmutation effects.

Evangelist

1: Novice Philosopher (Sp) cure light wounds  3/day, lesser restoration 2/day, or cure serious wounds 1/day
2: Altered State (Su) It is said that Haagenti introduced the concept of mutagens to the first alchemists at the dawn of time. Regardless of the veracity of this legend, your worship and faith in the Whispers Within grants you the ability to create a mutagen, as per an alchemist of a level equal to your Hit Dice - 4 (maximum 20th level). If you could already create mutagens, any mutagen you create from this point onward no longer applies its penalties to ability scores; in addition, any ability score increased by your mutagen increases by an additional 2 points.
3: Immortal Chymist (Su) You have mastered the legendary techniques of Haagenti's Divine Experiment. Your body no longer physically ages (although you continue to accrue mental bonuses), and you don't die from old age. If you were middle-aged or older, your body returns to its prime- you retain your mental bonuses but lose any penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution gained from advanced age. Each day, when you perform your obedience, you create a small amount of mystic quicksilver; if mixed with a potion of cure serious wounds, it creates a dose of oil of life. Just like that created by a philosopher's stone, if this oil is sprinkled over a dead body (a standard action), it revives the dead creature as per true resurrection. Alternatively, the quicksilver can be used to convert up to 1 pound of lead into gold (worth a maximum of 50 gp). This quicksilver loses its potency after 24 hours or when you next perform your obedience.

Sentinel

1: Alchemical Armaments (Sp) lead blades 3/day, alchemical allocation 2/day, or versatile weapon 1/day
2: Inventive Warfare (Ex) You can treat any weapon as if you were proficient with it. Any feats or effects you have that apply specifically to battleaxes (such as Weapon Focus or the sentinel's symbolic weapon class feature) or to the axe weapon group (such as the fighter's weapon training class feature) apply to any weapon you wield. In addition, as a swift action, you can grant weapons you wield one of the following special weapon features for 1 round: brace, disarm, nonlethal, reach, or trip.
3: Adaptive Flesh and Twisting Steel (Sp) You can transform into whatever form is most efficient for the battle ahead, and your tools remain ready for use. Whenever you use any polymorph effect, all of your equipment is altered in whatever manner necessary to function with your new form (including functioning as ghost touch or similar magical effects). You can use shapechange once per day. In addition, add monstrous physique IV, undead anatomy IV, and vermin shape II to the list of spells that shapechange spells you cast can function as.
