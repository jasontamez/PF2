Obedience

Spend at least 30 minutes working to make another sentient creature's life measurably worse or more miserable, whether by destroying its property, sabotaging its efforts, or afflicting it magically. Your victim must survive this encounter, but your actions can indirectly lead to its death, such as tainting a plague-ridden man's medicine or stealing the money a woman would use to pay back a loan. You must make your victim aware of your involvement, and always name some price or task your victim can perform to assuage your bitter heart and gain recompense for the damage you have inflicted, though this price does not need to be reasonable. You gain a +4 profane bonus on Intimidate checks.

1: Dread Gifts (Sp) fumbletongue 3/day, disfiguring touch 2/day, or eruptive pustules 1/day
2: Rot Their Minds (Su) Your spewed curses and venomous retorts take on a malevolent timbre, and your enemies' minds bend before the potency of your ire. Once per day, you can cast feeblemind, as per the spell, except remove curse can remove this effect, as can heal, limited wish, miracle, and wish. If the target fails its Will saving throw against this effect, it recognizes you as its afflictor. After this effect ends, if you are within 30 feet of the target, it is shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice or until you move more than 30 feet away from it (whichever comes first). This is a curse effect.
3: Mother of Curses (Su) The rage within your heart shields you against harm and turns it back on others. You gain an amount of spell resistance equal to 11 + your Hit Dice, but only against necromancy and transmutation spells, as well as enchantment spells of the charm subschool. Once per day, when a spell fails to penetrate your spell resistance, you can reflect it back on its caster, as if using spell turning.

Exalted

1: Alone Among Many (Sp) youthful appearance 3/day, undetectable alignment 2/day, or nondetection 1/day
2: Come by Night (Ex) Night is when others are vulnerable and trusting, and few can pierce the darkness to see your handiwork. You gain darkvision 30 feet and are immune to any magical sleep effects (this functions identically to an elf's immunity to magical sleep effects).
3: Curdled Trust (Su) You can sow the seeds of distrust in a group and assign the blame for your actions to another. Once per day, upon committing an evil act or casting a spell in front of witnesses, as a free action you can enchant all onlookers to believe another person known to them committed that act. If you know a creature's full name, you can name it specifically as the culprit. Otherwise, each onlooker sees a random friend or family member committing your actions. Onlookers who succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) are not fooled, though they might still be fooled by concealing clothing or mundane disguises you may be wearing. This is a mind-affecting enchantment effect.

Sentinel

1: Malice (Sp) ray of sickening 3/day, blindness/deafness 2/day, or excruciating deformation 1/day
2: Cloak of Curses (Su) You surround yourself in a shroud of whispered secrets and spiteful swearing, distorting the world around you and repelling others with the bitterness in your heart. Once per day, you can activate your cloak of curses as a standard action, and maintain it for up to 1 minute per Hit Die you possess. While the cloak is active, creatures of the animal and vermin type will not approach within 5 feet of you and move away if you approach them. Attacks from all other creatures suffer a 20% miss chance. This miss chance increases to 30% if the attacking creature is lawful or good (this miss chance does not stack). Creatures that succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) are not affected by your cloak of curses.
3: Never Suffer Alone (Ex) Misery is a gift you have received far too much of, and you have learned to reflect it onto others. Three times per day, when an opponent successfully deals hit point damage to you, you can immediately make an attack of opportunity against the creature that damaged you, even if you could not normally make an attack of opportunity. You can attack normally with this attack of opportunity or target the triggering creature with one of the spells granted by the malice boon above (though doing so provokes an attack of opportunity if an opponent is in melee with you). You can use this ability only once per round.
