Obedience

Paint a small picture, compose a short poem or song, dance a scene from a ballet, or create another work of art, whispering praise to Shelyn's beauty and grace as you do so. The art piece need be neither large nor complex, but heartfelt and made to the best of your ability. Gift the piece of art to a stranger and pay her a sincere compliment as you do so. If there are no suitable individuals around to receive the gift, leave it in an obvious place with a note praising Shelyn and asking whoever finds it to take it with your warmest wishes. Gain a +4 sacred bonus on Craft and Perform checks.

1: Fiction Weaver (Sp) silent image 3/day, minor image 2/day, or major image 1/day
2: Versatile Artist (Ex) Drawing on Shelyn's divine inspiration, you can substitute your bonus in a specific Perform skill for your bonus in another related skill, as the versatile performance class feature. Select one type of Perform skill which you can substitute for its associated skills. If you already have the versatile performance class feature when you obtain this boon, choose an additional Perform skill to substitute; you gain a +2 bonus on checks with this additional Perform skill.
3: Persuasive Aesthetic (Sp) You learned to pour your soul into works of art. Once per week, you can use symbol of persuasion as a spell-like ability. Instead of inscribing a symbol, you can cast this spell using a piece of art worth 5,000 gp or more as an arcane focus. Unlike the material components of symbol of persuasion, the artwork is not consumed during casting. Each creature within 60 feet of the artwork must succeed at a Will saving throw or be charmed by you (as the charm monster spell) for 1 hour for every Hit Die you possess. Covering or hiding the artwork renders its persuasive effect inactive until it is uncovered again. The persuasive effect lasts until the symbol is triggered or until you use this ability again, whichever comes first. You may choose a different piece of art every time you use this ability.

Exalted

1: Devotionals (Sp) unbreakable heart 3/day, calm emotions 2/day, or good hope 1/day
2: Joyous Ally (Sp) Your sense of beauty and the loyalty you bear your goddess have attracted the notice of her celestial servants. Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a lillend azata from Shelyn's divine realm in Nirvana to aid you. You gain telepathy with the lillend to a range of 100 feet. The lillend follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home on Elysium. The lillend doesn't follow any commands that would cause it to commit evil acts or destroy works of art, and the creature could even attack you if the command is particularly egregious.
3: Plumed Blade (Su) Even in battle, you partake of the beauty and joy with which Shelyn graces her devoted followers. As a free action, you can cause an illusion of brightly colored feathers to follow every swipe and motion of your weapon. When you do so, a single weapon you hold gains the holy and shock weapon special abilities. (You can use this ability on a ranged weapon, but can't apply it directly to a piece of ammunition.) If you drop the weapon or give it away, this ability's effects immediately end. You can grant weapons this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). The rounds don't need to be consecutive.

Sentinel

1: Graceful Warrior (Sp) animate rope 3/day, cat's grace 2/ day, or haste 1/day
2: Glorious Might (Su) Your passionate devotion to Shelyn grants you extra prowess in your battles against evil, allowing you to see and root out the ugliness at the heart of your foe. When you use your smite evil class feature, you gain double your Charisma bonus on attack rolls and your Charisma bonus + your paladin level on damage rolls. This replaces the normal bonuses for using smite evil. If you don't have access to smite evil, you instead gain a +2 bonus on weapon attack rolls against evil targets.
3: Cloak of Feathers (Su) An aura of colorful features, glowing with Shelyn's holy grace, shields you against electricity attacks with a measure of the protection enjoyed by the azatas who serve her. You gain electricity resistance 15.

Paladin Code

The paladins of Shelyn are peaceable promoters of art and beauty. They see the ugliness in evil, even when cloaked in the form of beauty, and their mission is to defend those who devote their lives to the creation of beauty, bring it forth themselves, and prevent the weak and foolish from being seduced by false promises. Their tenets include the following adages. <ul><li>I see beauty in others. As a rough stone hides a diamond, a drab face may hide the heart of a saint.</li><li>I am peaceful. I come first with a rose rather than a weapon, and act to prevent conflict before it blossoms. I never strike first, unless it is the only way to protect the innocent.</li><li>I accept surrender if my opponent can be redeemed-and I never assume that they cannot be. All things that live love beauty, and I will show beauty's answer to them.</li><li>I live my life as art. I will choose an art and perfect it. When I have mastered it, I will choose another. The works I leave behind make life richer for those who follow.</li><li>I will never destroy a work of art, nor allow one to come to harm, unless greater art arises from its loss. I will only sacrifice art if doing so allows me to save a life, for untold beauty can arise from an awakened soul.</li><li>I lead by example, not with my blade. Where my blade passes, a life is cut short, and the world's potential for beauty is lessened.</li></ul>
