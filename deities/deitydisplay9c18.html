Obedience

Spend 1 hour loudly proclaiming (or singing) the superiority of the various goblinoid races: the regimented militaristic mind of hobgoblins, the unbounded cruelty of goblins, and the sheer physical might of bugbears. You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks to demoralize foes, and the DC of Intimidate checks to demoralize you increases by 2.

1: Goblins Scare! (Sp) bane 3/day, castigate 2/day, or retribution 1/day
2: Shut Up and Listen! (Su) Many hobgoblin commanders believe that Hadregash accompanies them onto the field of battle and whispers tactical advice in their ears. As a standard action, you can provide an adjacent ally with similar guidance with a soft-spoken word or two. Your ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus on attack and damage rolls for 1 round; this bonus increases to +4 for dirty trick combat maneuver attempts. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.
3: My Blood Slithers! (Su) Hadregash has granted you the ability to replicate his creation of the goblin snake. Three times per day as a full-round action, you can deal 9 points of damage to yourself with a piercing or slashing weapon or your teeth and turn the spilled blood into a swarm of diminutive, venomous goblin snakes. The swarm functions as an advanced centipede swarm and appears adjacent to you. You can direct the swarm as a move action. The swarm lasts for 9 rounds.

1: Goblins Rule! (Sp) command 3/day, hold person 2/day, or dimensional anchor 1/day
2: You No Move! (Sp) When hunting for slaves, you know how important it is to keep them from running away. Upon succeeding at a touch attack against a Small or Medium creature as a standard action, you can summon a pair of masterwork fetters to hobble that target's movement. These fetters function as masterwork manacles for the purposes of breaking and escaping them. The target creature is entangled and can move at only half its normal speed, and must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check to move more than its reduced speed in a round. If the target fails this check by 5 or more, it falls prone. The fetters disappear after 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.
3: My Will is Best! (Ex) You are convinced of your own superiority and believe others should do what you say. Targets of your compulsion spells don't receive the +2 bonus on new saving throws attempted after being forced to act against their natures. In addition, you receive a +4 bonus on Charisma checks against targets of your charm spells to convince them to do things they wouldn't normally do.

1: Goblins Fight! (Sp) thunderstomp 3/day, bull's strength 2/day, or rage 1/day
2: Form of Wolf! (Sp) Like the barghest god you venerate, you can turn into a wolf. As a standard action, you take the form of a wolf as per beast shape I. You can remain in this shape a number of minutes per day equal to your Charisma modifier. These minutes don't need to be used consecutively but must be used in 1-minute increments. You can return to your normal form as a move action.
3: My Might is Mighty! (Ex) The Supreme Chieftain teaches that you should be prepared for anything in a fight. Three times per day as a move action, you can gain the benefits of a combat feat you don't have for the following minute. You must meet all the feat's prerequisites, and if you use this ability again before the duration expires, the new combat feat replaces the old one. If a combat feat has a daily use limitation (such as Stunning Fist), any uses of that combat feat while using this ability count toward that feat's daily limit, even through multiple uses of this ability.
