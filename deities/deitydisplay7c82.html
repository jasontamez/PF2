Obedience

Take a handful of mixed gems, coins, and keys. Include coins from three or more different currency systems (such as from three different kingdoms), as well as at least three different keys-one of which should be the key to a lockbox, vault, or other such storage item. Kneel before a scale and balance the items as perfectly as you can on it, removing and replacing items in order to create the most equitable balance of items. Randomize the items you select each time you perform this obedience, so as not to let your obedience become routine. Meditate on the teachings from The Order of Numbers. Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws against spells and effects generated by creatures with a chaotic alignment. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience. Once made, this choice can't be changed.

The character gains the ability to cast <a href="spelldisplay32e1.html?ItemName=Word%20of%20Recall">word of recall</a> as a spell-like ability (CL 20th). This version of <a href="spelldisplay32e1.html?ItemName=Word%20of%20Recall">word of recall</a> can transport the caster across planar boundaries, but it still doesn't function in areas that bar teleportation effects. When a character gains this gift, the GM designates as the spell's sanctuary a specific temple of Abadar located in a city of at least 1,000 inhabitants.

1: Diplomat (Sp) comprehend languages 3/day, calm emotions 2/day, or glibness 1/day
2: City Dweller (Ex) You never become lost in cities of more than 5,000 inhabitants-upon entering a city, even for the first time, you can always retrace your steps and intuit where particular districts must be. Furthermore, you pick up local accents and vernacular instantly, giving you the cant of a citizen. You also gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Disguise and Knowledge (local) checks while in the bounds of a city.
3: Sneaky Bolt (Ex) Three times per day, you can snipe with a crossbow while hidden, and have little chance of revealing your location. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. You can use this ability only if your target is within 30 feet of you and unaware of your presence or precise location. Once you roll your attack, immediately attempt a Stealth check for sniping without the normal -20 penalty.

Exalted

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy94wj?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Gods-Hardcover">Inner Sea Gods pg. 12</a>
1: Ordered Mien (Sp) Abadar's truthtelling 3/day, align weapon (lawful only) 2/day, or magic circle against chaos 1/day
2: Diplomatic Immunity (Ex) While within the bounds of a city of more than 5,000 inhabitants, you gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. You also gain special status with the law. You're considered a person to be respected, and may obtain special treatment and assistance that ordinary citizens could not, such as information on political activity, criminal investigations, or threats against the city. Any bribes or fees that would normally be levied by the legal system are waived for you. City guards and officials with an initial starting attitude of unfriendly or hostile instead have an attitude of indifferent toward you. These benefits apply only when you identify yourself as an exalted of Abadar.
3: Scales of Balance (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, you can pool and redistribute your current hit points and those of all willing allies within 30 feet of you. Total your current hit points and those of your willing allies, and then decide how you wish to redistribute them among the same individuals. You cannot give an ally more hit points than her maximum, nor can you leave an ally with 0 hit points.

Sentinel

1: Lawful Bulwark (Sp) shield of faith 3/day, shield other 2/day, or archon's aura 1/day
2: Unflagging Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a zelekhut inevitable. You gain telepathic communication with the zelekhut to a range of 100 feet, and the zelekhut follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for each Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home. The zelekhut doesn't obey any command that would violate its lawful alignment'such commands are met with grim refusal, and could even prompt the zelekhut to attack you if the command is egregious enough.
3: Dictum Blow (Su) Once per day, you can channel the effects of dictum through your weapon, though you don't need to cast (or even know) the spell. You must declare your use of this ability before rolling your attack. On a hit, the target is affected as if caught in the area of dictum as cast by a cleric of a level equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20). If the target is lawful or its Hit Dice exceeds yours, it is unaffected. If your attack misses or the creature is unaffected, the dictum effect is wasted.

Paladin Code

Of all the neutral gods, only Abadar supports and promotes a holy order of paladins. As the god of civilization and order, Abadar recognizes the value of holy warriors in advancing society's aims. His paladins follow the standard paladin code of protecting the innocent, acting with honor and honesty, and respecting lawful authority. In addition, an Abadaran paladin upholds the following creed. <ul><li>I am a protector of the roadways and keep travelers from harm. No matter their destinations or goals, if they are peaceable and legitimate travelers who harm no others on the road, I will ensure that they pass safely.</li><li>Bandits are a plague. Under my will they come to justice. If they will not come willingly before the law, where they can protest for justice in the courts, they will come under the power of my sword.</li><li>Corruption in the courts is the greatest corruption of civilization. Without confidence in justice, citizens cannot believe in their countries, and civilization begins to disappear. I will root out corruption wherever I find it, and if a system is fundamentally flawed, I will work to aid citizens by reforming or replacing it.</li><li>I am an aid to the markets. I ensure equitable trade between merchants and citizens. Theft and deceit on either side are intolerable.</li><li>I make opportunities, and teach others to recognize them. When I aid others, I open the way for them, but will not carry them-they must take responsibility.</li></ul>

Divine Fighting Technique



Abadar's Crossbow

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdy?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Weapon-Masters-Handbook">Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 10</a>
Abadar teaches complex crossbow techniques.

Initial Benefit: You can attempt a ranged steal combat maneuver check with a crossbow, using your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to calculate your Combat Maneuver Bonus. If you succeed, the stolen item is knocked away by the bolt; if the bolt can pierce any part of the item and the item weighs 2 pounds or less, the bolt continues past the creature and carries the item up to one range increment away, pinning it to whatever surface it lands on.

Advanced Prerequisites: Rapid Reload, base attack bonus +10.

Advanced Benefit: When fighting a foe adjacent to a firm surface, you can attempt a ranged dirty trick combat maneuver check with a crossbow, using your Dexterity modifier in place of your Strength modifier to calculate your Combat Maneuver Bonus. If you succeed, your bolt pins the target's clothing (or feathers, hide, or the like) to the surface, preventing the target from leaving that space until it breaks free by destroying the bolt or removing it with a successful Strength check (DC = the result of your combat maneuver check to pin it).
