Boons - [Demonic Obedience](feat:DemonicObedience)

Demoniac

1: Mazmezz's Embrace (Sp) animate rope 3/day, web 2/day, or snare 1/day
2: Spider's Blessing (Sp) You can use poison and vermin shape II (see page 49) once per day each as spell-like abilities.
3: Temporal Web (Sp) Once per day, you may use temporal stasis heightened to function as a 9th-level spell. The target of this ability appears to be wrapped tightly in spiderwebs. You can maintain up to three targets in a temporal web at a time-if you use this ability on a fourth target, you must select one of the other three targets to immediately release. This ability is the equivalent of an 9th-level spell.

Boons - [Fiendish Obedience](feat:FiendishObedience)

Evangelist

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 72</a>
1: Webspinner (Sp) web bolt  3/day, web shelter 2/day, or vermin shape I 1/day
2: Blessing of the Creeping Queen (Ex) The dreams you experience of becoming one with the Creeping Queen finally manifest in reality with a welcome change to your form. Your lower half swells into a bloated spider's body, complete with eight spindly legs and dripping spinnerets. You become one size category larger, but your reach and the size of weapons you wield do not change. You gain the web universal monster ability (usable seven times per day) and a climb speed of 20 feet. You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet (or the range of your existing darkvision increases by 30 feet). Finally, you gain a permanent +2 bonus to your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (your choice).
3: Arachnidal Rebirth (Su) The Creeping Queen often uses the bodies of her victims as sources of nourishment for her brood, and the monstrosities that hatch from her corpse-implanted eggs often incorporate elements of the body in which they were birthed. In emulation of this horrific method of reproduction, you have been granted the ability to curse a foe to rebirth itself-when you do so, its new and horrible form bursts from the husk of its old flesh. This works like the witch's forced reincarnation hex, but instead of becoming a random race, the creature's new body is that of a spider of its original size category with the head of its original form. As with reincarnate, a rebirthed creature can be returned to its original form only through a wish or miracle spell. This ability can be used once per day, and a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect. If you have the hex or hex arcana class feature, you can use the DC for your hexes instead.

Exalted

1: Mazmezz's Embrace (Sp) animate rope  3/day, web 2/day, or snare 1/day
2: Spider's Blessing (Sp) Through study of eldritch patterns in the webs spun by spiders influenced by the Abyss, you have unlocked in your mind a pair of magical powers associated with the Creeping Queen you adore so. You can cast poison and vermin shape II once per day each as spell-like abilities.
3: Temporal Web (Sp) As you continue to study the patterns and twists in Abyssally influenced spiderwebs, you unlock a greater magical talent within yourself and can use webbing to trap a victim in place and outside of time's flow itself. Once per day, you can cast temporal stasis heightened to function as a 9th-level spell. The target of this ability appears to be wrapped tightly in spiderwebs. You can maintain up to three targets in temporal webs at a time; if you use this ability on a fourth target, you must select one of the other three targets to immediately release.

Sentinel

1: Adhesive Arcana (Sp) adhesive spittle  3/day, spider climb 2/day, or slow 1/day
2: Caught in the Web (Sp) You can call out to Mazmezz to wrap your foes in paralytic webs. Three times per day, you can cast quickened web as a spell-like ability.
3: Trapped Like Flies (Su) If a target begins a turn entangled in a web you created, it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. This is a poison effect.
