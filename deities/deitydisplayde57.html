2: Smell of Death (Ex) You gain the <a href="umr6bd3.html?ItemName=Scent">scent</a> ability. Your sense of smell is particularly acute in regard to undead, granting you blindsense (30 feet) for the purposes of detecting all forms of undead.
3: Soul Lock (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, you can trap the soul of a sentient creature that has died in the last minute, creating a soul gem. This is a death effect. A soul gem is a Fine object with 1 hit point and hardness 2. You can destroy a soul gem you created as a standard action to free the soul within, though this doesn't return the deceased creature to life. Any attempt to resurrect a body whose soul is trapped in a soul gem requires a caster level check (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Failure results in the spell having no effect, while on a success, the soul gem shatters and the creature returns to life as normal. If the soul gem rests in an unholy location, such as that created by the spell <a href="spelldisplaydb22.html?ItemName=unhallow">unhallow</a>, the DC of this caster level check increases by 2. You can maintain a number of soul gems at one time equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
