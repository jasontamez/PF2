Obedience

Hang a set of chimes where they will be stirred by either wind or water. If no suitable location exists to hang the chimes, you must hold the chimes and shake them gently to sound them throughout your obedience. Chant prayers from Hymns to the Wind and the Waves as you attune yourself to the sound of the chimes, then drink a mouthful of pure water and pour a handful over your head. Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws against electricity and water spells and effects. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

1: Weather Watcher (Sp) endure elements 3/day, resist energy 2/day, or protection from energy 1/day
2: Experienced Traveler (Ex) As a free action, you can grant yourself and any allies within 30 feet of you the ability to move through undergrowth at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. This effect lasts 1 round for every Hit Die you possess or until you dismiss it as a free action, whichever comes first. Your allies must remain within 30 feet of you to gain the benefits. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect you and your allies. While using this ability, you also gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws against spells and effects that would cause such terrain-based movement impairment, such as the entangle spell. (Your allies do not also gain this bonus.)
3: Elemental Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can cast summon monster VII to summon a greater elemental of a type you choose. You gain telepathic communication with the elemental to a range of 100 feet, and the elemental obeys your commands perfectly.

1: Green Worker (Sp) entangle 3/day, warp wood 2/day, or speak with plants 1/day
2: Lightning Child (Su) You become resistant to lightning and similar effects. Gain electricity resistance equal to 5 + your Hit Dice.
3: Nature's Companion (Ex) Your animal companion develops greater combat prowess, mental acumen, and protection against natural elements. First, your animal companion gains a +1 bonus to its Intelligence and Wisdom scores. Second, your animal companion gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on attack and damage rolls. Third, your animal companion gains a +4 sacred or profane bonus on all saving throws against cold, electricity, and fire spells and effects. If you don't have an animal companion, you instead gain the ability to use summon nature's ally VII as a spell-like ability once per day.

1: Sky Warrior (Sp) shocking grasp 3/day, elemental touch (lightning only) 2/day, or lightning bolt 1/day
2: Elemental Aura (Su) You can create an elemental aura as a free action. When you first gain this ability, choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire-once you make this selection, it can't be changed. When you generate the elemental aura, you are surrounded by the element you chose. Anyone striking you with a melee weapon or natural attack takes 2d6 points of damage of the chosen type, plus 1 point for every 2 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 2d6+10). This aura lasts for 1 round for every Hit Die you possess. The rounds in which you manifest your elemental aura don't need to be consecutive. You can dismiss the aura as a free action.
3: Lightning Surge (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can call upon the sky to strike you with a lightning bolt that deals no damage to you but instead seems to fill you with boundless energy. You gain 2d10 temporary hit points, and any fatigued or exhausted conditions you are suffering from end. You also gain a +2 bonus to Strength, and your natural attacks and melee weapons deal an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage. These effects last for 1 round plus an additional round for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). You can call upon this lightning when you are indoors, underground, or even underwater.
