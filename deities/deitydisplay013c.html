Paladin Code

The paladins of Ragathiel are shining beacons of furious resolve on the battlefield, and they are careful stewards of valor everywhere. These paladins disproportionately come from cultures that are typically hostile to paladin training, including those of half-orcs, hobgoblins, Gebbites, and the Nidalese. The tenets of Ragathiel's paladins include the following affirmations.<ul><li> I will avenge evil wrought upon the innocent.</li><li> I will not give my word lightly, but once it is given, I will uphold a promise until my last breath.</li><li> Those proven guilty must be punished for their crimes. I will not turn a blind eye to wrongdoing.</li><li> Rage is a virtue and a strength only when focused against the deserving. I will never seek disproportionate retribution.</li><li> Redemption finds hearts from even the cruelest origins. I will strive not to act upon prejudice against fellow mortals based on race or origin.</li></ul>
