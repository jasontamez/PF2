1: Kiss of the Succubus (Sp) unnatural lust  3/day, detect thoughts 2/day, or vampiric touch 1/day
2: Tempting Flesh (Su) You can shape your flesh into seductive forms. You gain the change shape universal monster ability, usable once per day as a standard action, allowing you to take the shape of any Small or Medium humanoid. Your natural form becomes beautiful and sexually appealing, and you gain horns, a pointed tail, and small wings. While in your natural form, you gain a tiefling's darkvision and fiendish resistance racial traits as well as the prehensile tail and vestigial wings alternate racial traits. If you're already a tiefling, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma instead of these additional tiefling traits. In any form, you gain a +4 bonus on Bluff checks to deceive or lie.
3: Deadly Caress (Su) Like with a succubus, romantic or sexual contact with you can be deadly. When you engage in an act of passion (such as a kiss) with another creature, you bestow one negative level upon that creature. You must grapple an unwilling creature to use this ability on them. Such an act of passion also has the effect of a suggestion spell asking the victim to accept another act of passion. The DC of this suggestion, as well as the DC to remove any negative levels bestowed this way, is equal to 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier. You can initially activate this ability only once per day, but once you do so to target a specific creature, you can affect that creature with this ability at will.

1: Murder Walks Unseen (Sp) vanish  3/day, invisibility 2/day, or twilight knife 1/day
2: Right behind You (Ex) You gain sneak attack +2d6; this stacks with sneak attack dice from other sources. Whenever you make a sneak attack against a creature that is aware of your presence and considers you an ally, your sneak attack dice are increased to d10s; this applies to both sneak attack dice gained through this boon and those from other sources.
3: Death Is But a Word (Sp) Your devotion to Nocticula is rewarded with a single whisper from her lips to your ear alone, revealing one of the countless words Our Lady in Shadow knows to cause death. Each of her worshipers receives a unique word. When you learn it, you can use the word to cast power word kill as a spell-like ability once per day.
