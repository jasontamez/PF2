Obedience

In a cavern, impale a living sacrifice on a stalagmite so that the creature does not die immediately. Dance around the sacrifice while shouting prayers to Zevgavizeb, taking time every 10 minutes to push the impaled creature further down the stalagmite. Time the dance so that at the end, the creature is at the stalagmite's base-it need not survive to the end of the dance. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against special attacks and spells originating from reptilian creatures.

1: As a Foulness (Sp) silent image  3/day, ghoul touch 2/day, or stinking cloud 1/day
2: Mind Stomp (Sp) You can crush a foe's psyche like a dinosaur stepping on a rat. You can cast psychic crush III once per day as a spell-like ability.
3: Primeval Paragon (Sp) You are heir to the unmatched psychic power of the troglodyte lords of old, and you can wield this power to make slaves of those creatures whose service is yours by right. You can cast dominate monster once per day on humanoids, reptilian animals, or other reptile-like creatures (such as dragons). You can have only one creature dominated at a time via this effect, but the effects are permanent until you dominate a new target, at which point the previous target is released from domination. A target released this way is immediately affected by feeblemind, with no saving throw, but a target that is released from control via other methods (such as via dispel magic) does not suffer this fate.

1: Zevgavizeb's Blessing (Sp) charm animal (reptiles only) 3/day, darkness 2/day, or greater magic fang 1/day
2: Children of the Caves (Sp) Once per day, you can cast summon monster VII as a spell-like ability to summon one fiendish tyrannosaurus, 1d3 fiendish elasmosauruses, or 1d4+1 fiendish ankylosauruses.
3: Primeval Might (Ex) You become infused with primeval power, gaining a +4 profane bonus to your Constitution score and natural armor.

1: Saurian Spellcraft (Sp) thunderstomp 3/day, darkvision 2/day, or beast shape I (reptiles only) 1/day
2: Scaled Monstrosity (Sp) By invoking the blessing of the God of the Troglodytes, you can take the form of the mightiest reptiles ever to exist. You can cast extended beast shape IV three times per day as a spell-like ability. If you assume the form of a dinosaur and you are capable of casting spells in your original form, you can also cast spells in your dinosaur form as if you had the Natural Spell feat; treat this spell as wild shape for the purpose of that feat's effects.
3: Lizard Tyrant (Sp) You can cast summon monster VII once per day to summon one advanced fiendish tyrannosaurus. The duration of this spell is permanent, but you can have only one tyrannosaurus summoned this way at a time. As a summoned monster, this advanced fiendish tyrannosaurus is still hedged out by effects like protection from evil, and it can be banished as normal.
