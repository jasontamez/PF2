Obedience

Spend an hour in deep meditation, reflecting on the nature of the cosmos and your exceptional place above all others in the multiversal scheme-preferably while under the effects of a perception-altering drug. The DC of all illusion spells you cast increases by +2 and you gain a +2 profane bonus on saving throws to resist mind-affecting effects.

1: Voice from the Mist (Sp) ventriloquism 3/day, hypnotic pattern 2/day, or major image 1/day
2: Persistent Illusions (Su) Whenever you cast an illusion spell with a duration of concentration (plus any number of rounds), add half your level to the duration.
3: Indirect Dose (Su) You can apply drugs of the injury type to a weapon as if they were poison. Additionally, you can't accidentally expose yourself to a poison or a drug when applying it to a weapon-though you are still exposed if you roll a 1 when attacking with a poisoned weapon.

1: Mists of the Mind (Sp) silent image 3/day, invisibility 2/day, or create drug 1/day
2: Breathe in the Cosmos (Su) Upon ingesting a drug-including those conjured by the create drug spell-you heal an amount of damage determined by the severity of that drug's base addictiveness: 1d6 for minor, 2d6 for moderated, 3d6 for major. Additionally, when taking the drug adyton, you automatically succeed at the Will save.
3: Breathe Out Death (Su) You know the secrets of controlling the flow of blood and toxins in your body. You gain a +4 saving throw against poison and can no longer become addicted to drugs. Additionally, you gain a +4 bonus on rolls to become stable when reduced to negative hit points. Finally, your life span is supernaturally lengthened, with each aging step (middle age, old, venerable) being postponed by a number of years equal to double your Wisdom score.

1: Dervish in the Mist (Sp) disguise self 3/day, blur 2/day, or displacement 1/day
2: Inescapable Fate (Su) When you wear armor not made of metal, its maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 2.

Additionally, the DC for entangled creatures to escape a net you wield increases by 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess.
3: Cut to the Truth (Su) Whenever you attack a target and have to roll a percent mischance as a result of effects such as concealment, blur, or similar effects, reduce that percent miss chance by 10%. Additionally, when taking the drug adyton, you automatically succeed at the Will save.

1: Voice from the Mist (Sp) ventriloquism  3/day, hypnotic pattern 2/day, or major image 1/day
2: Persistent Illusions (Su) You have experienced incredibly realistic visions and memorable hallucinations as a result of drug-fueled rituals to the Dowager of Illusions, and as such you are particularly gifted at infusing your own illusions with a veneer of reality and believability that helps your unreal creations to persist. Whenever you cast an illusion spell with a duration of concentration (plus any number of rounds), add your level to the additional spell duration.
3: Indirect Dose (Su) You can apply drugs of the injury type to a weapon as if they were poison. When you do so, the save DC for the drug increases by 2. Additionally, you can't accidentally expose yourself to a poison or a drug when applying it to a weapon-though you are still exposed if you roll a 1 when attacking with a poisoned weapon.

1: Dervish in the Mist (Sp) disguise self  3/day, blur 2/day, or displacement 1/day
2: Inescapable Fate (Su) Just as Mahathallah eschews cumbersome armor, you prefer to serve your mistress in flowing robes and shimmering veils. When you wear armor not made of metal, its maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 2. This applies to armors normally made out of metal but crafted from different materials such as bone or obsidian. Additionally, the DC for entangled creatures to escape a net you wield increases by 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you have.
3: Cut to the Truth (Su) Whenever you attack a target and have to roll a percent miss chance as a result of effects such as blur or concealment, reduce that percent miss chance by 20%. If this reduces the miss chance to 0%, the creature no longer counts as having concealment against you at all. Additionally, when taking the drug adyton, you automatically succeed at the Will save.
