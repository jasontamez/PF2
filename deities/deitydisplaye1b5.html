Obedience

Remain entirely silent for 1 hour while you pray to Dahak, ruminating over the glories of wanton destruction committed as the culmination of waiting and planning. While you pray, let hate and anger fill you until you must lash out. Following your prayer, destroy an item worth at least 1 gp and use the shattered remains to cut yourself, preferably along preexisting scar lines, while espousing your love of chaos and destruction. Such an action deals you 1 point of damage that cannot be healed for the following 24 hours. You gain a +2 profane bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks against creatures who can see your scars.

1: Sorrowmaker's Pact (Sp) protection from good 3/day, align weapon (evil only) 2/day, or rage 1/day
2: Enemy of Dragonkind (Su) You can protect yourself from the noble forces of the universe and are attuned to blocking out draconic threats. When you are under the effects of protection from good or a similar effect, true dragons with fewer Hit Dice than you count as summoned creatures for the purpose of interacting with you, regardless of their alignment. In addition, three times per day while under such an effect, you can reroll one saving throw against a breath weapon, spell, or spell-like ability used against you by a creature of the dragon type. You can only reroll a single saving throw once.
3: Bow Before Your End! (Su) You represent one of the most powerful deities in the cosmos, and you expect all creatures to recognize the unspeakable power you herald and its capacity for wanton destruction. Once per day as a standard action, you can create an effect similar to overwhelming presence as though you were a cleric with an effective caster level equal to half your Hit Dice. Creatures that fail their saving throws are staggered instead of helpless for the duration of the spell, and suffer no further effects upon a successful subsequent save. Creatures of the dragon type must roll their saving throws twice and take the lower result. A creature that succeeds at its initial saving throw is unaffected by this effect.

1: Rites of the False Wyrm (Sp) charm person 3/day, mirror image 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Draconic Decoys (Su) Duplicity is second nature to you, and you know how to manipulate trickery-based magic to further confound your enemies. Anytime you have created an image via mirror image, as a swift action you can direct one of your images to move to a flanking position against an enemy within 15 feet of you. The image allows you or an ally to flank your target for the purpose of a single attack. A redirected image dissipates when you or an ally uses the image to make a flanking attack, or otherwise remains in place for 1 round before dissipating.
3: Flaming Vengeance (Su) You believe that if your enemies are foolish enough to trust you, then they are foolish enough to die by Dahak's power. Once per day as a standard action, you can gain the benefits of a mislead spell as though cast by a wizard of a level equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20th level), with the following modifications. At the time of using this ability, you can establish a number of rounds before it will expire, or declare that it will expire when your illusory duplicate is touched. When either criteria is accomplished, the illusory duplicate explodes as a fireball spell cast by a 10th-level wizard.

1: Power of the Endless Destruction (Sp) ear-piercing scream 3/day, shatter 2/day, or fireball 1/day
2: Teeth of the Dragon (Ex) Your teeth grow into vicious fangs, akin to those of a chromatic dragon, and elemental power issues forth from your mouth in a divine gift from Dahak himself. You gain a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage for Medium creatures or 1d4 points of piercing damage for Small creatures, with a critical multiplier of ??3. Every time you hit with your bite attack, you deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (choose from acid, cold, electricity, or fire).
3: Elemental Outrage (Ex) You can channel the power of the Endless Destruction through your vicious bites-when you hit a creature with your bite attack, you can force impressive elemental power into the attack. Up to three times per day, when you succeed at a critical hit with your bite attack, you deal 5d6 points of energy damage (choose from acid, cold, electricity, or fire) instead of 1d6 points. This extra damage is not multiplied as part of the critical hit.

Antipaladin Code

Antipaladins of Dahak are grim servants of the Endless Destruction, their demeanor calm up until the moment their control slips. They hunt metallic dragons as a means of repaying Dahak for his blessing. Dahak lays down several tenets for his divine warriors to follow. <ul><li>I am an instrument of destruction, but the power I wield is mine to control, gifted to me by Dahak.</li><li>My wrath is ceaseless. It is by my judgment alone to decide when I shall unleash it. Once I strike an enemy, I will not stop until they are dead.</li><li>None are safe from the rage that boils within me. While some may be spared immediate death, I offer no such lenience to the metallic dragons, greatest of enemies to the power that gives me strength.</li><li>Forgiveness is for the weak. If I am slighted, I will go to any lengths to enact my vengeance.</li></ul>
