Obedience

Over the course of 1 hour, spend an equal amount of time practicing with a weapon or your unarmed strikes, reading any text that you have never read before, and braiding a length of hair while contemplating the mysteries of the multiverse. Hang the length of hair around your neck when your obedience is complete and wear it for the rest of the day. Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on all Knowledge checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

1: Expansive Knowledge (Sp) identify 3/day, fox's cunning 2/ day, or secret page 1/day
2: Inevitable Fist (Su) For a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, you can infuse your limbs with the power of pure law. Your unarmed strikes deal damage as if you were one size category larger, and gain the axiomatic weapon special ability. Activating or dismissing this ability is a free action, and the rounds don't need to be consecutive.
3: Runic Form (Sp, Su) Nine runic tattoos appear on your body, three for each of the three disciplines of Irori: mind, body, and spirit. As a standard action (unless otherwise noted) you can discharge the power stored in a tattoo. Once spent, a tattoo's power returns gradually over the course of 1 week. The tattoo powers are as follows:

Body Tattoos: Two contain cure serious wounds, which you can use as a spell-like ability. One contains restoration, which you can use as a spell-like ability.

Mind Tattoos: Two can each be discharged as a swift action to allow you to reroll a saving throw against an enchantment spell or effect. You must use this ability before you learn the result of your save, and you must take the second result, even if it is lower. The third can be discharged to grant you a +4 sacred bonus to Wisdom for 1 minute.

Spirit Tattoos: Two allow you to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell etherealness. The third allows you to gain spell resistance equal to 10 + 1 for every Hit Dice you possess for 1 minute.

1: Cloud the Mind of the Unwary (Sp) hypnotism 3/day, daze monster 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Repair the Damaged Body (Su) Up to three times per day, when you can cast a conjuration (healing) spell with a range of touch, treat it as having a range of close instead.
3: Walk Above the Earth (Su) You hover several inches off the ground as if levitating. This doesn't affect your speed, and makes you immune to most kinds of difficult terrain, traps triggered by pressure, and potentially other effects. You can levitate over solid surfaces only, so you fall if you step off a cliff or over a liquid. You can, however, raise or lower yourself as levitate. If you make an attack while hovering, you are not subject to the attack and damage penalties listed in the levitate spell description. However, if you move yourself higher in the air using a move action, you become subject to the attack and damage penalties until you return to the ground.

1: Masterful Warrior (Sp) true strike 1/day, false life 2/day, or haste 3/day
2: Secrets of the Enemy (Ex) The knowledge you've gained over the years regarding different creatures lets you strike your foes with unerring insight. As a standard action, you can study your opponent during combat, a task which requires you to succeed at a Knowledge check related to the enemy's type (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 99). The DC is equal to 10 + your opponent's Hit Dice. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against that enemy. If you fail at the Knowledge check, you may try again with another action, but all subsequent attempts to use this ability against the same enemy take a cumulative -2 penalty.
3: Perfection of Form (Ex) You develop your body to such a degree of physical perfection that you become almost untouchable by the ravages of toxins and disease. You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws against poison, magical and supernatural diseases, and spells and effects that cause ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels. You also become immune to nonmagical diseases.

Divine Fighting Technique



Irori's Perfected Fist

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 29</a>
Practically synonymous with Irori and his faith, The Woven Fist is among the best known of all diving fighting manuals. Many learned monks were taught their first martial techniques using drills and regiments from this manual, which some claim was written by Irori's own hand before his ascension to divinity. Although most commonly found in temples to Irori and secluded monasteries, copies of The Woven Fist often make their way into less scrupulous hands because of their effectiveness.

Optional Replacement: A lawful neutral brawler or monk can replace a bonus feat with the following initial benefit.

Initial Benefit: You can take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls made with your unarmed strikes in order to deal the average amount of damage with each successful attack instead of rolling your weapon damage. For instance, if your unarmed strike would normally deal 1d4 points of weapon damage, you instead deal 2 points of weapon damage. Apply bonuses and modifiers to this result as if you had rolled your damage normally. You must choose to use this benefit before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. You do not average additional damage dice (such as those granted by a sneak attack) when using this ability.

Advanced Prerequisites: Critical Focus; Divine Fighting Technique; Weapon Focus (unarmed strike); base attack bonus +10 or monk level 10th.

Optional Replacement: A lawful neutral brawler or monk of at least 10th level who worships Irori and has the Divine Fighting Technique feat can replace a bonus feat with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.

Advanced Benefit: You no longer take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with your unarmed strikes when you choose to deal the average amount of damage. If you critically hit a creature when using this ability, you automatically inflict maximum weapon damage for that critical hit (although you must still roll sneak attack dice or any other dicebased additional damage).

Monks with access to the quivering palm ability may use it to render a target comatose for an extended period (lasting until the target receives a <a href="spelldisplayda83.html?ItemName=Heal">heal</a>, <a href="spelldisplay8e95.html?ItemName=Restoration">restoration</a>, or <a href="spelldisplay7223.html?ItemName=Restoration,%20Greater">greater restoration</a> spell) rather than kill, chosen at the time the quivering palm is activated. Monks may use their wholeness of body ability on a willing creature as a standard action. The monk must touch the target, and the target becomes fatigued from this aid.
