Obedience

Spend at least 1 hour observing a crowded public place and help the first person you see fail or err. This may be mundane, such as assisting a shopkeep in her accounting, or dire, as in helping a failed pickpocket escape the town guard. Gain 5 temporary ranks in a skill you do not currently have any ranks in. These bonus skill ranks vanish after 24 hours.
