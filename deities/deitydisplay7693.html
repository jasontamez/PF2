Obedience

You must cavort naked atop a hill, rooftop, or mountaintop during a storm, or else ritualistically sever the fingers, toes, then arms and legs of a nonevil being, burning each severed fragment to ash before moving on to the next. Gain a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against weather-related effects and spells.

Boons - [Demonic Obedience](feat:DemonicObedience)

1: Storm Breath (Sp) obscuring mist 3/day, gust of wind 2/day, or call lightning 1/day
2: Earthshaker (Sp) You can cast earthquake once per day, but this ability only affects a 40-foot-radius spread. This ability is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.
3: Invoke the True Storm (Sp) You can cast storm of vengeance once per day.

Boons - [Fiendish Obedience](feat:FiendishObedience)

Evangelist

1: Storm's Wrath (Sp) shocking grasp  3/day, aggressive thundercloud 2/day, or lightning bolt 1/day
2: Tempest Hide (Ex) Urxehl rewards your devotion by transforming your skin into leathery rust-red hide (if you already have fur, hide, or scales on your body, the coloration merely changes). As a result of this transformation, you gain electricity resistance 30. If you are already immune to electricity (or if you gain immunity to electricity at a point after you gain this boon), you gain sonic resistance 30 instead. In either case, the gift allows you to enjoy the fury of the greatest of storms in relative safety.
3: Storm of Verakivhan (Su) You can unleash the power of the Trollfather with your voice, channeling the raw fury of his eternally tempest-tormented realm in a thunderous shout. With a mighty roar, you blast those around you with deadly storms of Abyssal energy. Twice per day as a standard action, you can exude waves of energy in a 30-foot-radius burst centered on yourself. The blast does not harm natural vegetation or creatures in the area you wish to exclude from damage. Other creatures in the area take 1d8 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per character level you have (maximum 20d8) and are stunned for 1 round. You choose what type of energy damage this ability deals when you activate your storm (all targets take the same type of energy damage; you can't cause one target to take fire damage and another to take acid damage). A creature that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) takes half damage and negates the stunned effect.

1: Storm Breath (Sp) obscuring mist  3/day, gust of wind 2/day, or call lightning 1/day
2: Earthshaker (Sp) You can cast earthquake once per day as a spell-like ability, but it affects only a 40-foot-radius spread.
3: Invoke the True Storm (Sp) You can cast storm of vengeance as a spell-like ability once per day.

Sentinel

1: Master of Trolls (Sp) enlarge person  3/day, resist energy (acid or fire only) 2/day, or fireball 1/day
2: Rip Flesh and Tear Limbs (Ex) Your limbs become rangy and your hands twist into ghastly claws. You gain two claw attacks, each dealing 1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature; in addition, you gain the rend ability, which requires two successful claw attacks and deals a number of points of damage equal to the damage die of one claw plus your Strength modifier. If you already have the rend ability, you deal double your existing rend damage when rending.
3: Trollfather's Chosen (Ex) Your flesh knits together with gruesome speed, healing wounds almost as soon as they are inflicted. You gain regeneration 5 (acid or fire). If you already have regeneration, increase the rate of healing granted by your regeneration by 10 instead.
