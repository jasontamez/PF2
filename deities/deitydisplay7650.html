Obedience

Immerse yourself in lava or a roaring flame for one hour. During the first half hour, recite passages from the Law of the Shield and meditate upon how your god's will guides your actions. Divide the remainder of the hour between recounting the orders and obligations that your superiors have given you, and planning the orders you will give your subordinates on the following day. You gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the cold descriptor.

1: Slave-Taker's Tools (Sp) command 3/day, stoke the inner fire 2/day, or chain of perdition 1/day
2: Sense Slaves (Ex) You gain the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoids. You gain a +2 favored enemy bonus against humanoids, which stacks with any favored enemy bonus you already possess against humanoids.
3: Searing Strike (Su) Once per day, you can channel the Prince of Steel's power through your weapon as a free action. You must declare your use of this ability before you make an attack roll. On a hit, the weapon creates a burst of fire. Your target takes 5d6 points of fire damage and catches on fire unless it succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma modifier). If the target catches on fire, it takes an additional 2d6 points of fire damage each round until it succeeds at a Reflex save at the original DC. All fire damage from searing strike ignores fire resistance, but not fire immunity.

1: Tyrant's Weapons (Sp) bane 3/day, dread bolt 2/day, or protection from energy 1/day
2: Fiery Fangs (Su) Two fangs made of fire emerge from your mouth. Twice per day as part of casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, you may remove one of these fangs and use it to augment that spell or spell-like ability; this counts as adding a somatic component to the casting. This augmentation acts as your choice of one of the following metamagic feats: Bouncing Spell, Elemental Spell (fire only), Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, or Silent Spell. The fangs are insubstantial, and cannot be used to make a bite attack.
3: Burning Bladestorm (Sp) You can create a whirling curtain of blades of fire and steel. This ability acts like a blade barrier cast by a cleric but also sends out waves of heat like a wall of fire. Fire giants may pass through the blades without taking any damage. Humanoid creatures killed by this ability rise as uncontrolled burning skeletons.

1: Might Makes Right (Sp) protection from good 3/day, weapon of awe 2/day, or deadly juggernaut 1/day
2: Knight of Arms (Ex) You may treat any weapon as if you were proficient in it and had the Weapon Focus feat for that weapon. If you already have Weapon Focus for that weapon, your critical hits with that weapon cause the target to bleed as if you had the Bleeding Critical feat; half this bleed damage is fire damage.
3: Pyroclastic Champion (Su) Zursvaater infuses you with more of his essence. As a free action, you can surround your body in an aura of fire that ignites any combustible object you touch, and provides you with cold resistance 20. Any time you deal fire damage with a natural or manufactured weapon (including magic weapons), double the amount of fire damage that you would normally deal. This damage increase doesn't apply to fire damage from spells or spell-like abilities.
