Obedience

Spend an hour in a secluded location while crafting a work of art. If your hour of work begins at, ends at, or includes the stroke of midnight, then the subject of your art is up to you. Otherwise, your art must include the concept of midnight in some way. When you aren't adjacent to an ally, gain a +1 morale bonus to your AC and on all saving throws.

1: Avoid Society (Sp) <a href="spelldisplaydcc4.html?ItemName=vanish">vanish</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay749c.html?ItemName=invisibility">invisibility</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay32e1-2.html?ItemName=nondetection">nondetection</a> 1/day
2: Seed of Redemption (Sp) Once per day, you can make a special touch attack against an outsider. On a hit, the outsider becomes staggered for 1 round as it suddenly becomes aware of the fact that it need not follow the ethos and morals of its kind- that it can choose options other than the traditions of its ilk. The outsider must also succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become favorably disposed toward you, as if affected by <a href="spelldisplaye96b.html?ItemName=charm%20monster">charm monster</a>; in this case the stagger effect persists for 1d4+1 rounds, even if the charm effect is dispelled or negated. Given time, you may be able to convert the outsider from its ways and help it find a new path beyond its alignment, although the GM should adjudicate the time and potential success of such an endeavor. This effect is the equivalent of a 7th-level mind-affecting spell.
3: False Demise (Su) Once per day, when you are reduced to negative hit points by damage, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point and affected by a <a href="spelldisplay65a0.html?ItemName=mislead">mislead</a> spell (caster level equals your character level). The illusory double created by the spell appears to be your dead body.

1: Artist's Flourish (Sp) <a href="spelldisplayf4de.html?ItemName=crafter's%20fortune">crafter's fortune</a> 3/ day, <a href="spelldisplayf109.html?ItemName=wood%20shape">wood shape</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay2667.html?ItemName=major%20image">major image</a> 1/day
2: Swift Creation (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can conjure an object into existence in your vicinity. Objects created in this fashion are always artistic in appearance- otherwise this spell-like ability functions as <a href="spelldisplay36ee.html?ItemName=major%20creation">major creation</a>.
3: Summon Sculpture (Sp) Once per day, you can summon a construct to do your bidding. This functions as <a href="spelldisplay7fcb.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%209">summon monster IX</a>, but you can only choose to summon one <a href="monsterdisplay63d5.html?ItemName=Iron%20Golem">iron golem</a>, 1d3 <a href="monsterdisplaybef5.html?ItemName=Stone%20Golem">stone golems</a>, or 1d4+1 <a href="monsterdisplay0212.html?ItemName=Glass%20Golem">glass golems</a>.

1: Midnight's Grace (Sp) <a href="spelldisplay10d2.html?ItemName=true%20strike">true strike</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay505e.html?ItemName=cat's%20grace">cat's grace</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplaybe46.html?ItemName=keen%20edge">keen edge</a> 1/day
2: Sinuous Daggerplay (Ex) You grow a sinuous tail (if you already have a tail, you grow a second one). This tail is prehensile and capable of manipulating and holding small objects, but cannot perform fine manual work as if it were a hand, with the exception of wielding a dagger. When you make a full attack, you can make an additional attack with this tail-wielded dagger. When you do so, you resolve this attack as a primary attack, add your Dexterity modifier to any damage dealt (in addition to any modifiers you might have from Strength), and have a reach that is 5 feet greater than your base reach. Wielding a dagger with your tail in this way does not count as two-weapon fighting for the purposes of determining penalties to attacks made with weapons wielded in your hands. In any round during which you don't make a full attack but you wield a dagger with this tail, it makes a single attack against an adjacent enemy of your choice-if it hits, it deals no damage but distracts the foe enough so that you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against that target. You cannot attack with this tail-wielded dagger in any other way, including as a thrown weapon.
3: Midnight Rejuvenation (Su) Every night at midnight, you gain the benefits of a <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> spell and a <a href="spelldisplay7255.html?ItemName=restoration,%20greater">greater restoration</a> spell (both resolve at a caster level equal to your character level).
