Obedience

Gather with others for an hour and discuss a topic that threatens the bonds of your community, family, or friendship. If you and your allies are fortunate enough that no such malady is currently a challenge, read and recite passages from She of Grace and Might to remind yourselves of your goals and aspirations for the day. If you are traveling alone, find others to speak to about the beneficial strengths of community and freedom to develop that community into a more positive place. Guide any arguments during this discussion toward understanding and acceptance, even if afterward not all parties agree on the final resolution. Gain a +2 sacred bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks.

2: Liberating Surge (Su) When your allies are threatened, you have the tools to alleviate them of their imposed limitations. Once per day as a standard action, you can cast either <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> or <a href="spelldisplayd71b.html?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement">freedom of movement</a> as a spell-like ability targeting one of your allies within 300 feet whom you can perceive. The spell has a caster level equal to your character level.
3: Shared Expertise (Su) You know that your bond to your allies is your greatest benefit. Each time you complete your obedience, you can select a bonus <a href="feats0beb.html?Category=Teamwork">teamwork feat</a>. You must meet the prerequisites for this feat. All of your allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feat as you for the purpose of determining whether you receive the benefit of the teamwork feat. As a free action, you can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear you. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of the bonus teamwork feat. You can grant this feat for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice. These rounds need not be consecutive. You can select a different teamwork feat for this boon each time you complete your obedience.

2: Defending Shield (Su) Your dedication to protecting your community manifests as a way to shield yourself and others. Three times per day as a standard action, you can summon a mystical glowing shield that sheds light as a torch. This shield manifests in a square within 30 feet of you, and it can share your space or that of any of your allies. If the defending shield is in a creature's square, it grants that creature a sacred bonus to its Armor Class equal to your Wisdom modifier. You can move the shield to a different square within 30 feet of you as a swift action and can dismiss the shield as a free action. The defending shield lasts for 10 rounds each time it is summoned.
3: Bountiful Refuge (Su) You know the benefits of a communal meal shared with friends and family. Once per day, you can create a safe extradimensional space that you and your allies can occupy for a number of hours equal to your Hit Dice. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size) that you designate, all of which must be within 30 feet of you when you use this ability. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. Creatures within the space can see the environs outside of the space, but those outside cannot see inside. Within the refuge is a bountiful table set with as many chairs as the number of creatures invited in, and the table holds a delicious feast that acts as the <a href="spelldisplay8706.html?ItemName=heroes%e2%80%99%20feast">heroes' feast</a> spell with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice.

3: Allied Actions (Su) You understand that any actions undertaken for good are multiplied by those within your community. Once per day as a standard action, you can cast <a href="spelldisplay24f7.html?ItemName=battlemind%20link">battlemind link</a> as a spell-like ability.

Paladin Code

Paladins of Kazutal proudly defend their communities and encourage strong relationships among the people they know and with whom they interact. Kazutal's paladins prefer friendship to violence, but they never back down from their responsibility to stand up for those weaker than themselves or those they consider under their protection. Their tenets include the following affirmations. <ul><li>Bonds are what give our society strength. Though families and communities are complex and ever changing, I will focus to maintain the positive connections with my own family and community, and encourage others to do the same. </li><li>No law, price, or justification can legitimize slavery. I will free slaves where I find them and will never enslave another creature to act against its own will. </li><li>Conquest is destruction. I will always fight to defend others from violent subjugation, and no tyrant will ever receive my deference. </li><li>I understand that failure is expected, and that my life belongs to more than myself. If I give my life for others, I do so fully respecting its worth, and I will do my best to prevent others from committing pointless sacrifices. </li><li>Love is the province of the brave. If I value something, I must not hide my feelings. I will show the world my love by protecting that which I cherish. My example lends my strength to those who share my love but fear to act. </li><li>I will defend liberty, even when it challenges established community and family standards. Those who are true to themselves forge the strongest relationships with others, and I must protect them so long as they do no harm and do not infringe on others' liberty in turn.</li></ul>
