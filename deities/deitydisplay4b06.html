Obedience

Pick a direction, and walk that way for the next 30 minutes. During this time, catalog all of the areas you pass and consider any tactical advantages that can be found in the terrain. After this, retrace your steps, but instead of plotting tactics, appreciate the beauty and scenery that you find along your way, and speak quiet prayers to or praises of the Waybringer, keeping in mind that none of what you've seen would exist were it not for Apsu. You then gain a +2 sacred bonus on Perception checks while you are traveling in this area, and a +4 sacred bonus on checks to notice enemies for the purpose of acting in a surprise round while you are traveling or camping there.

1: Maker's Ways (Sp) floating disk 3/day, align weapon (law only) 2/day, or tiny hut 1/day
2: Touch of the Artificer (Su) You have discovered divinely inspired lines of primordial energy-gifts from Apsu, you believe-that can imbue weapons with bursts of magic. Up to three times per day, as a standard action, you can touch a single weapon and grant it the dancing property for the next 3 rounds. A single weapon cannot be targeted by this effect more than once per day.
3: Crafter's Pride (Sp) You have learned the intrinsic nature of what gives life to objects, and can pour your soul into the construction of a given creation to infuse it with a semblance of blessed life. Once per week, you can cast animate objects on a single object that you've created. The effect does not have a duration; the animated object remains indefinitely as a companion, following your commands as best it can. You cannot animate a new companion while one is already serving you, though as a full-round action you can dismiss a companion, reducing it to lifelessness. If your companion is destroyed, you cannot use this ability again for another week. You cannot affect an object animated in this way with a permanency spell.

1: Waybringer's Ingenuity (Sp) blurred movement 3/day, levitate 2/day, or haste 1/day
2: Eyes of the Pursued (Su) You adhere to Apsu's dictate of living to fight another day, and you've mastered the art of monitoring places you've left. Anytime you use a teleportation effect to move, you can place an invisible magic sensor in the area from which you just departed. As long as you are on the same plane as the sensor, you can see and hear everything occurring within 30 feet of the sensor as a swift action. The sensor lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. You can have a maximum number of active sensors equal to your number of Hit Dice.
3: Homeward Bound (Su) As a follower of Apsu, you deeply understand the importance of having a safe place to which you can retreat; you've come to count on several safe homes, creating ties to them when necessary. Once per month, you can designate a location to be your refuge. Once per week as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 30 feet of you to the safe home of your choice, regardless of distance, as long as it is on the same plane. You can have a maximum number of refuges equal to half your Hit Dice. As long as none of your allies are in a refuge, you can remove its designation as a safe home as a swift action, but if you do so, you can never again designate it as a safe home.

1: Exiled's Wrath (Sp) color spray 3/day, scorching ray 2/day, or draconic reservoir 1/day
2: Apsu's Shroud (Su) Apsu smiles upon your martial prowess and protects you with a halo of divine energy from his distant realm. You gain a +1 sacred bonus to your Armor Class, which increases to +2 against attacks from evil-aligned creatures. This bonus increases to +3 if the attacker is an evil-aligned true dragon. If an evilaligned true dragon confirms a critical hit against you, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be blinded for 1 round.
3: Chromatic Scourge (Su) You channel the righteous and immortal fury of Apsu into your weapon, making it ready for the endless fight against Dahak and his wicked allies. Once per day as a swift action, you can imbue your weapon with the hidden wrath of Apsu. If your target is evil, you gain a +20 profane bonus on your next single attack. If your opponent is an evil-aligned creature of the dragon type, treat your next single attack roll as both an automatic hit and a critical threat. You gain a +4 profane bonus to confirm the critical hit.

Paladin Code

Paladins of Apsu valiantly follow the dragon god's tenets of holy vigilance against evil. Those following the rigid code of a paladin must sacrifice the sedentary lifestyle of living in a single place in exchange for continuous travel and hardship. The tenets of such paladins include the following maxims. <ul><li>I am the talon of Apsu's wrath. I strike where I am needed, but only when evil has been unmasked and there can be no doubt of my enemy's malice.</li><li>When my purpose is unclear, I will walk the roads of the world to find a fresh focus. Every road leads to a new beginning.</li><li>Nothing is worth sacrificing my life for, except protecting the lives of others. I will retreat when needed, and come back to vex my foes once again.</li><li>Mercy is offered, but only once. Should I be betrayed in my moment of kindness, I will not stop until I have put my enemy down.</li><li>It is not enough to slay evil and carry on. I will spend the time necessary to help those I-ve protected to fend for themselves.</li></ul>

Other Rules

Apsu has no oracles, for he believes inflicting a curse on a living creature is a terrible crime against that being, even in exchange for divine power.
