Obedience

Take three swigs of strong liquor or saltwater, shouting a loud boast to any bystanders after each drink. If anyone responds to your bluster, challenge that person to a contest of drinking, bragging, or sword dancing. If you are defeated, concede graciously and give the victor a gift worth at least 10 gp; if you win, taunt the loser with more boasts and insults. If no suitable bystanders are nearby, engage in a whirling, stomping dance with a nine-ring broadsword for an hour, clattering the blade's rings until they throw sparks around you. Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on saves against electricity and wind effects for the next 24 hours. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.

2: Stormborne (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can call on a storm cloud to bear you into the air. This enables you to fly at a speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability. It lasts for 1 minute per HD (maximum 20 minutes). If it's dispelled or the duration expires while you're aloft, you descend at a rate of 60 feet per round for 5 rounds, then fall any remaining distance normally.
3: Thunderstrike (Su) Once per day as a free action, you can declare one of your attacks to be a thunderstrike. You must declare the use of this ability before rolling to attack. If the attack hits and you deal damage, the blow lands with a clap of thunder that paralyzes your target and deafens foes within 10 feet of the strike for 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) negates the deafening effect and is stunned for only 1 round.

2: Blessing of Sea and Storm (Su) As a full-round action, you can transmute a flask of either rainwater or seawater into a potion of any spell of 4th level or lower that you currently have memorized and that otherwise qualifies under the standard potion rules. You lose the memorized spell, as if it had been cast, when it is transferred into the potion. If the spell requires a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must also provide that component. The potion retains its magic for up to 24 hours or until used. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).
3: Hei Feng's Rage (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a cyclone of black wind and spiked lightning within 30 feet, which fills a 20-foot-radius area that extends 75 feet high. The cyclone cannot be moved once called. Creatures in the area take 4d6 points of electricity damage plus 1 point for every 2 Hit Dice you have (maximum +10) every round they're caught in the cyclone. You can dismiss the cyclone as a free action. Otherwise, it lasts up to 5 rounds; when it dissipates, it releases a clap of thunder that knocks all creatures in the area prone. A creature can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to halve the damage taken, and a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to avoid being knocked prone.

2: Thunder's Vengeance (Su) As a move action, you can surround yourself with crackling electricity that deals 2d6 points of electricity damage plus 1 point for every 2 Hit Dice you have (maximum 2d6+10) to each creature that attempts to strike you with a melee weapon or natural attack. You can maintain the aura for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20 rounds), but the rounds need not be consecutive. You can dismiss the aura as a free action.
3: Unstoppable Storm (Su) As a free action, you can empower your lightning to overcome resistances. For the next round, whenever you deal electricity damage to a creature that has resistance to electricity, ignore an amount of resistance equal to half your Hit Dice (up to a maximum reduction of 10). You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20 rounds), but the rounds need not be consecutive.

Antipaladin Code

Antipaladins of Hei Feng are self-sufficient wanderers who roam the land, offering great aid or-more commonly-great destruction at their own whims. They are rarely deceptive about their intentions, and desperate people can ask them for help, knowing that these antipaladins will keep their word if they agree to offer assistance. Any slight, however, will be met with overwhelming retribution. The code of Hei Feng's antipaladins contains the following adages. <ul><li>The blessing of the storm comes in lightning. I am permitted to offer sincerely altruistic aid, so long as that aid comes in the form of violence visited upon others. </li><li>The clouds warn of coming rain. My wrath may be sudden, but it is honest. I may trick a foe with boasts or cunning, but I do not pretend to be a friend to those I intend to harm. Such sycophancy is cowardice. </li><li>The wind cannot be chained. I stay nowhere for long, and I do not abide oaths that try to restrain me for longer than a month. If I make such promises, they have no weight, and those who trust them are fools. </li><li>My last word is a thunderclap. None shall insult me, or my god, without paying a terrible price. My revenge will be unstoppable and absolute.</li></ul>
