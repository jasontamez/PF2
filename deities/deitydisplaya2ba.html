1: Frozen Wrath (Sp) chill touch 3/day, bull's strength 2/day, or sleet storm 1/day
2: Cold's Caress (Ex) Gain cold resistance 30. If you are immune to cold, you may instead gain fire resistance 30. You may change to fire resistance if you gain immunity to cold at a point after you gain this boon.
3: Wrath of Frost (Sp) You can cast giant form I once per day. Three times during this ability's duration, you can cast an empowered cone of cold as a spell-like ability. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.

1: Frozen Vengeance (Sp) frostbite  3/day, chill metal 2/day, or unadulterated loathing 1/day
2: Deathless Vengeance (Sp) After you are slain, you will not rest until your killer is dragged shrieking into death with you. One round after your demise, your soul rises from your corpse and instantly seeks out your killer. This acts as per phantasmal revenge, except this is a necromancy effect with the death descriptor instead of the spell's normal school, subschool, and descriptors.
3: Eternal Vengeance (Sp) While Kostchtchie's centuries of labor have brought him no closer to discovering the legendary torc that holds his cloven soul, he has learned much about the manner in which his soul was captured, and he gifts you with a fragment of that knowledge. Once per day, when you are the target of an attack or spell that would either kill you or render you helpless, you can target your attacker with a trap the soul spell as an immediate action after you resolve the effects of the attack on yourself (even if you are dead when this effect occurs). Instead of a gemstone, you must be carrying a piece of jewelry (such as a bracelet, ring, or torc) of adequate value to contain the target's soul. (Value derived from magical properties counts for this purpose.) A single piece of jewelry can hold only one soul, but if you are restored to life, you can release a trapped individual as a standard action by holding the jewelry out before you, which causes the target to reappear prone in that square. A creature released this way is stunned for 1d4 rounds.

Exalted

1: Frozen Wrath (Sp) chill touch  3/day, bull's strength 2/day, or sleet storm 1/day
2: Cold's Caress (Ex) Your lord's realm is a perpetually frozen landscape, and in unholy anticipation of taking your rightful place in that land your body has begun to adapt and change. You gain cold resistance 30. If you are immune to cold, or gain immunity to cold at a point after you gain this boon, you instead gain fire resistance 30.
3: Wrath of Frost (Sp) Regardless of your true form, you see purity and power in the hulking shape of all giants. As a reward for your faith and devotion, you have gained the ability to cast giant form I as a spell-like ability once per day. Three times during this ability's duration, you can cast empowered cone of cold as a spell-like ability.

1: Giant's Might (Sp) enlarge person  3/day, bear's endurance 2/day, or force punch 1/day
2: Twisted Grasp (Ex) Your arms become longer, nearly dragging the ground when you walk, and appear to be bloated with unnatural muscle. You gain a slam attack that deals damage as appropriate for a creature one size category larger than yourself (1d8 for a Medium creature). If you already have one or more slam or claw attacks, those attacks deal damage as though you were one size category larger. This does not affect the size of manufactured weapons you can wield, but you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with manufactured melee weapons.
3: Titan Shape (Sp) Through the blessing of the Deathless Frost, you can swell to giant size and crush your enemies with your titanic might. You can cast extended giant form II once per day as a spell-like ability. While under this effect, your gear resizes to fit your giant form. You can use this ability to assume a Huge-sized form of a giant that normally isn't Huge, such as a frost giant.
