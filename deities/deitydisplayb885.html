Boons - Daemon Harbingers</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 115</a>
Abaddon's unique daemons take on a host of titles, customized to their methods and vanity. These harbingers enjoy sweeping influence among daemons as favored advisors, and they work to cultivate their own cults on Abaddon and beyond.

Daemon harbingers are neutral evil demigods that range in power from CR 21 to CR 25. The boons they grant are less complex than those granted by the Horsemen themselves, manifesting as spell-like abilities usable twice per day each.

1:  unnatural lust
2:  scrying
3:  quickened invisibility
