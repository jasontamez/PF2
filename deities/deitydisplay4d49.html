1: Necromancer's Secrets (Sp) detect undead 3/day, command undead 2/day, or vampiric touch 1/day
2: Invoke Death (Sp) Once per day, you may use slay living as a spell-like ability. A creature slain by this spell immediately rises from death as a juju zombie (see Pathfinder Bestiary 2). The zombie is not under your control, but it will not attack you. This ability is equivalent to a 7th-level spell.
3: Call the Dead (Sp) Once per day, you may summon a nightwing (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2), 1d3 devourers, or 1d4+1 advanced mohrgs as if using summon monster IX.

1: Power of Death (Sp) inflict light wounds 3/day, death knell 2/day, or animate dead 1/day
2: Destined for Undeath (Su) Your soul is tainted with the essence of undeath. You are damaged by positive energy and healed by negative energy, as if you were undead; the bonus on saving throws granted by your obedience applies against positive energy effects instead of negative energy effects (you retain the bonus on saving throws against death effects). In addition, you gain immunity to exhaustion, fatigue, and nonlethal damage, and you gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects, diseases, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poisons, stunning, and effects that cause damage, drain, or penalties to your physical ability scores.
3: Word of Finality (Sp) With a single word of unfathomably dark power, you can invoke a concentrated upsurge of negative energy within a living target's body, snuffing out a creature's life force with horrific speed. Once per day, you can cast power word kill as a spell-like ability. This is a necromancy (death) effect instead of an enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting] effect.

Exalted

1: Necromancer's Secrets (Sp) detect undead 3/day, command undead 2/day, or vampiric touch 1/day
2: Invoke Death (Sp) Once per day, you can cast slay living as a spell-like ability. A creature slain by this spell immediately rises from death as a juju zombie. The juju zombie is not under your control, but it will not attack you.
3: Call the Dead (Sp) Once per day, you can summon a nightwing, 1d3 devourers, or 1d4+1 advanced mohrgs as if you had cast summon monster IX.

Sentinel

1: Abyssal Rage (Sp) doom 3/day, sound burst 2/day, or rage 1/day
2: Aspect of the Prince (Sp) You can take on a form resembling that of the Prince of Undeath himself. You can cast divine vessel once per day as a spell-like ability, but only to assume a fiendish aspect. Instead of gaining two claw attacks from this fiendish aspect, you gain a gore attack that deals 2d6 points of damage.
3: Wand of Orcus (Sp) Like the legendary Wand of Orcus, you can cause your mace to inflict instant death upon those it strikes. Once per day as a swift action upon successfully hitting a creature with a melee attack with a heavy mace, you can cast slay living on that creature. You must be wielding a heavy mace when you utilize this ability-while the heavy mace can itself be magical, it can't be one that bears any form of lawful or good magic (such as a holy weapon) or one that has particular power over undead (such as an undead bane or disrupting weapon).
