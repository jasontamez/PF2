Obedience

Meditate upon your infirmities and the slow, inevitable progression of physical and mental decay inherent to the ravages of time. Mimic this progression by immersing yourself or a victim in icy water until nearly unconscious, or by consuming alcohol or drugs that dull memory and mental faculties. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against necromancy and negative energy effects.

1: Death's Blessing (Sp) memory lapse  3/day, catatonia  2/day, or create soul gem 1/day
2: Soul Crush (Su) As a standard action, you can crush a soul gem (such as one you create via create soul gem or one created by a cacodaemon) to gain fast healing 15 for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. This action condemns the crushed soul to Abaddon; resurrecting this victim requires a successful DC 28 caster level check.
3: Death's Clutches (Sp) You can use soul bind as a spell-like ability once per day.

Exalted

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 36</a>
1: Death's Grace (Sp) ray of enfeeblement 3/day, death knell 2/day, or sands of time 1/day
2: Hunger of the Styx (Su) By channeling the memory-sapping ability of the River Styx, you can stun foes with a sudden but temporary loss of all memory. You can use this ability three times per day, activating it as a swift action when you strike a foe in combat with a melee weapon. The creature struck is stunned for 1 round and then staggered for an additional 1d4+1 rounds if it fails a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). On a successful save, the creature is instead staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.
3: Grasp of the Styx (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can call upon the waters of the Styx to bubble up and manifest as an immense, skeletal talon of mud and black water. This effect duplicates the effects of grasping hand, except any creature that is grappled by the hand must also succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell or gain 1 negative level.

Sentinel

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 36</a>
1: Death's Crusader (Sp) mount  3/day, wartrain mount 2/day, or phantom steed 1/day
2: On a Pale Horse (Su) You gain the ability to invoke the power of the Pale Horse. As a swift action, you cause a flickering image of the Pale Horse to appear in a 10-foot square adjacent to you. It then moves up to 120 feet as you mentally direct its movement (doing so is a move action that requires concentration). The image of the Pale Horse ignores difficult terrain and can walk over water or other surfaces that would normally not bear a creature's weight, but it cannot fly. Any creature whose space the image of the Pale Horse passes through must succeed at a Fortitude save or take a -6 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, as if it had suddenly aged to become venerable. Creatures (like dragons) that normally gain benefits from aging do not gain any benefits, and they instead take the ability score penalties described above. These penalties do not stack with themselves or with existing penalties from aging. A creature can resist the effects of the Pale Horse with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). A creature can be affected by the Pale Horse only once per round, regardless of how many times the Pale Horse moves through its space. This is an aging curse effect.
3: Death's Call (Sp) Once per day, you can call upon Charon's power to wither your enemies into dust. This ability functions as wail of the banshee, except it lacks a sonic component.
