Obedience

Perch atop a high outcrop and look out over the surrounding terrain. If the outcrop is in an uninhabited area, you need do nothing more but wait for an hour, but if the outcrop is in an inhabited area (such as a city), no passersby should realize you are a living thing-any who do must be slain before the hour's end. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against effects that cause sickness, nausea, fatigue, or exhaustion.

1: Gargoyle's Gift (Sp) sanctuary 3/day, shatter 2/day, or vampiric touch 1/day
2: Glutton's Feast (Sp) You can cast heroes' feast once per day. The food created by this effect consists of raw or rotting meat and rancid milk. Those who partake of this feast consume their food shockingly fast, as if they were starving-it takes only 1 minute to gain the effects of this spell. Nonworshipers of Xoveron must make a Fortitude save (16 + your Charisma modifier) to avoid being sickened by the feast for 6 hours (though all other benefits of the feast still apply). This ability is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.
3: Death-Stealing Gaze (Su) You gain the death-stealing gaze ability of a nabasu (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 64). You can activate this ability as a free action, and can use it for up to 3 rounds per day plus an additional number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus-these rounds need not be consecutive. The saving throw to resist this gaze is equal to 10 + 1/2 your HD + your Charisma modifier. Nabasu demons who gain this boon can use their death-stealing gaze at will, regardless of their total number of growth points.

Evangelist

1: Master of Desolation (Sp) detect secret doors  3/day, soften earth and stone 2/day, or meld into stone 1/day
2: Ruinwalker (Sp) The Horned Prince is master of all ruins, and his blessing lets you flash instantly from place to place in such desolate areas. You can cast dimension door (self only) as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your Hit Dice. Both the start and end point of your teleportation must be within a single continuous area of ruins terrain, such as an ancient dungeon or catastrophe-wracked city. Whether a given area constitutes ruins terrain is decided at the GM's discretion.
3: Wake the Ruined Realm (Sp) At your bidding, the remains of ancient civilizations and shattered cities rise up to destroy your foes. Once per day as a standard action, you can cause a Large stone statue within 30 feet to animate as a stone golem. The golem obeys your commands and remains active for up to 1 hour. If the stone statue you target is a statue of Xoveron, the resulting stone golem gains the advanced creature template.

Exalted

1: Gargoyle's Gift (Sp) sanctuary  3/day, shatter 2/day, or vampiric touch 1/day
2: Glutton's Feast (Sp) You can cast heroes' feast once per day as a spell-like ability. The food created by this effect consists of rancid milk and raw or rotting meat. Those who partake of this feast consume their food shockingly fast, as if they were starving-it takes only 1 minute to gain the benefits of this spell. Those who don't worship Xoveron must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 16 + your Charisma modifier) or be sickened by the feast for 6 hours (though all other benefits of the feast still apply).
3: Death-Stealing Gaze (Su) You gain the death-stealing gaze ability of a nabasu. You can activate this ability as a free action and use it for up to 3 rounds per day plus a number of additional rounds equal to your Constitution modifier-these rounds need not be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-round increments. All living creatures within 30 feet of you when your death-stealing gaze is active must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or gain a negative level. A humanoid slain in this manner immediately transforms into a ghoul under your control. You can create only one ghoul in this manner per round. If multiple humanoids die from this ability simultaneously, you choose which of them rises as a ghoul. Nabasu demons that gain this boon can instead use their death-stealing gaze at will, regardless of their total number of growth points.

Sentinel

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 102</a>
1: Gargoyle Magic (Sp) stone fist  3/day, protection from arrows 2/day, or fly 1/day
2: Idol of Desolation (Sp) You can take on the strength of stone without sacrificing your awareness to temporarily become a sentinel of stone. You can cast statue as a spell-like ability once per day.
3: Sculptor's Strike (Su) The strike of your weapons causes a specified foe to calcify and harden into stone, bit by bit, eventually transforming that enemy into a favored child of Xoveron. To use sculptor's strike, you must first designate a foe in sight within 30 feet as a standard action. Once you've designated the foe, whenever you deal damage to that creature with a melee weapon (including unarmed strikes and natural weapons), the creature takes 1d6 points of Dexterity drain in addition to the normal damage. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) this drain is reduced to 1 point. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity in this way is permanently transformed into a gargoyle (as per polymorph any object, except no Fortitude save is allowed) and must succeed at a Will save (using this ability's DC) or have its mind also become that of a gargoyle (as per baleful polymorph). When a creature is transformed in this way, all Dexterity drain caused by this effect is instantly healed and the creature's hit points are fully restored. The mental change can be reversed by any effect that removes curses, but the physical transformation can only be reversed by miracle or wish. You can activate sculptor's strike once per day to designate a foe, but once you've done so, that foe remains susceptible to your ability until you or it is slain. If you designate a different foe on a later day, any previously designated foe is no longer designated and can no longer be affected by this ability (unless you designate it once again at a later date).
