1: Tower's Boons (Sp) sanctuary 3/day, eagle's splendor 2/day, or archon's aura 1/day
2: Rite of Passage (Sp) You gain the power to usher others into a new state of being. Once per day, you can cast greater polymorph on a willing creature. The duration of this effect is permanent until you or the target dismiss the effect or you use this ability again.
3: Undo Maturation (Su) Once per day with a successful touch attack, you can rewind the sands of time for a single creature, causing the target to revert to the previous age category, taking all the appropriate penalties to mental ability scores without any of the benefits to physical ability scores. If the target is an adult, it gains the simple young creature template. If the target already has the simple young creature template, it rejuvenates even further, reducing all its ability scores by 2 (to a minimum score of 1) and decreasing its size by an additional step.
