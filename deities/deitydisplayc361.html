Obedience

Build a fire, preferably as part of a ritual that includes your closest allies and comrades. Use that fire's smoke to blacken the head of an axe while reciting battle litanies from Angradd's Tempering (or Torag's Hammer and Tongs, Magrim's Measure, or Journey of the Last Breath if you also wish to show reverence for Angradd's respected elder brothers). Clean the ash from the axe with a cloth (traditionally a red cloth, often granted to you as a gift from a family member). Successful melee attacks made with that axe by a lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good creature deal an additional 1 point of fire damage. (This damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.)

1: Smoke of Righteous Flame (Sp) <a href="spelldisplay3e9a.html?ItemName=burning%20hands">burning hands</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay7740.html?ItemName=discovery%20torch">discovery torch</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay8e01.html?ItemName=ash%20storm">ash storm</a> 1/day
2: Bulwark Against Evil (Su) You are a shining beacon against the forces of evil and have internalized much of Angradd's fury against those who are vile and cruel. You gain DR 5/-, which applies only against attacks from creatures with the evil subtype or attacks that can bypass DR/evil.
3: General of the Just (Su) You are a mobile focus of the divine strategy of Angradd, able to turn the tide of battle by inspiring your allies to instinctively work together. Allies within 60 feet (not including yourself) gain a +2 morale bonus on initiative checks, on melee damage rolls while flanking, and to AC when adjacent to you or at least one other ally of yours.

2: Blazing Righteousness (Su) You can channel Angradd's divine flames to burn agents of malevolence. As a free action, you can wreathe yourself in flames, granting you resistance 20 against fire and causing any evil creature adjacent to you at the beginning of your turn to take 2d6 points of damage (half of which is fire damage). Dismissing this ability is also a free action. This ability lasts a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 per 4 Hit Dice you have (maximum 6 rounds). The rounds don't need to be consecutive.
3: Boon Companions (Sp) Three times per day, you can summon an ally to assist you in the fight against evil. This acts as a <a href="spelldisplay0208.html?ItemName=summon%20nature%e2%80%99s%20ally%201">summon nature's ally</a> or <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a> spell with a spell level equal to half your Hit Dice (maximum spell level 9th). The summoned creatures must be lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good, and they gain the fire, good, and lawful subtypes. You can communicate with the summoned creatures as if you had a shared language.

2: Cut Down to Size (Su) Any axe you wield shines with red and gold light, as the <a href="spelldisplay9f2d.html?ItemName=light">light</a> spell. You gain <a href="featdisplay2107.html?ItemName=Cleave">Cleave</a> as a bonus feat with any axe. If you already have Cleave, you gain the first feat from the following list that you don't already have when wielding an axe: <a href="featdisplay6bcb.html?ItemName=Great%20Cleave">Great Cleave</a>, <a href="featdisplay795d.html?ItemName=Cleaving%20Finish">Cleaving Finish</a>, <a href="featdisplayccf8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Cleaving%20Finish">Improved Cleaving Finish</a>.
3: Army of One (Sp) Once per day you can summon a small army of allies to aid you in combat. You can summon either one greataxe made of pure force per 4 Hit Dice you have (each as a <a href="spelldisplaybe6b.html?ItemName=spiritual%20weapon">spiritual weapon</a> spell) or one dwarven warrior made of pure force per 8 Hit Dice you have (each as <a href="spelldisplay5c10.html?ItemName=spiritual%20ally">spiritual ally</a>). If you summon force weapons, you can direct all the summoned weapons with a single move action. If you summon force allies, you can direct all the summoned allies with a single swift action. This acts as a spell with a spell level equal to half your Hit Dice (maximum spell level 9th). If any of the force effects you summon with this ability are dispelled, they are all dispelled.

Paladin Code

Paladins of Angradd see themselves as frontline soldiers in the war against evil. They seek to form coalitions not just to take down evils in the present, but to leave the world better prepared to oppose such evils in the future. Their tenets include the following affirmations. <ul><li>I oppose evil in all its forms. I do not accept a weak evil just because I must also oppose a mighty evil. To defeat evil, I must understand it and know its strengths and weaknesses. Any evil I cannot defeat now, or that by opposing I would allow greater evil to escape or develop, I must study and work against so that I may more fully defeat it when I am ready. I must share what I learn with others who will fight alongside me. </li><li>I am more than a warrior against the darkness-I am a symbol of all that is just and fair. I must serve as an example and as an inspiration, by being righteous in all my actions and showing others how benevolence and order can be used to create a more just, stable, and sustainable society. </li><li>It is not enough to stop evil actions-the source of evil must be found and decisively defeated. I am not satisfied to passively wait for wrongs to come to my sight; rather, I seek them out. I will be a torch in the darkness and expose evil to the sight of others who are also willing to oppose it. </li><li>I am open in my dealings. I do not lie or look away from actions I cannot support. My opinions and goals are open for all to see. I may use stealth and deceit as needed for tactical purposes, but will not promote untruths or fraud.</li></ul>
