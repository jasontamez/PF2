Obedience

Go into the woods sometime between dusk and dawn. Find a set of animal prints, and track the creature down. When you find the creature, do not kill it, but instead kneel down near it and thank it for being part of the forest. Leave an appropriate food offering for this creature, and go without waking it up if it is sleeping or frightening it if it is awake. If it accepts your offering, once you have left or it awakens, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks. You can also attempt Handle Animal checks untrained, even if the task would normally require that you be trained. If there are no woods nearby, you can track an animal through a different kind of natural terrain instead. If you cannot access natural terrain of any kind, you cannot perform this obedience.

If you already have low-light vision, you instead gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. You also gain a +4 sacred bonus on Perception checks at night.

You can use the Stealth skill even when being observed, as per the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger's hide in plain sight ability</a>, and whenever you are moving at half speed or slower, you have concealment from enemies.

2: Beckon Creatures (Su) Your connection to the animals of the forest is deep, and they come running when they hear your call as quickly as they would come to help Ketephys. You gain <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">wild empathy as per a druid</a> of your character level. Once per day as a standard action, you can let out a cry and all animals within 200 feet immediately come to you as quickly as possible. They will not take unnecessarily dangerous risks to reach you, such as leaping over wide streams. This is a magical call, and animals respond even if unable to hear the call due to environmental conditions or deafness. For a number of minutes equal to your exalted level, you can communicate with these animals as if you had cast <a href="spelldisplay8821.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20animals">speak with animals</a>. They are automatically friendly to you but are not obligated to do what you ask.
3: Heal Poison (Ex) You have studied the venoms and poisons of the natural world enough to avoid their effects and help your allies. You gain immunity to poison. As a standard action when an ally is poisoned, you can attempt a Heal check to study the poison. If the result of your check exceeds the DC of the poison by 5, you immediately neutralize the poison and reverse the instantaneous or permanent effects caused by the poison, such as ability damage. You do not heal hit point damage or ability damage or drain caused by any other effects, and you must attempt a separate check for each poison affecting your ally. You must be adjacent to your ally to use this ability. If you fail, you cannot use this ability for either that ally or that poison for 1 week.

2: Forest's Ward (Su) You are a sacred guardian of the forest, protecting the wilderness as Ketephys does, and the forest protects you in turn. Whenever you are in the forest, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to AC. No matter what terrain you are in, creatures of the animal type must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + your Hit Dice) or be unable to attack you unless you harm them first.
3: Hunter's Shot (Ex) You have practiced Ketephys's art of archery for so long that you can ignore effects that would ruin shots for lesser archers'some say your aim is as good as that of the Hunter himself. You ignore cover or concealment from plants, though trees large enough to completely block your vision still provide total cover to the target. You also take no penalties on your ranged attacks due to the effects of wind, and you ignore any miss chance caused by mundane or magical winds. This ability functions no matter what terrain you are in.
