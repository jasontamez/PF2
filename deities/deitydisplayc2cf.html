Obedience

Seek out a cluttered place, such as an overgrown garden or messy closet. Spend 1 hour cleaning the space, removing at least half of the contents to consume, donate, or destroy. If you cannot access such a space, spend 1 hour in silent contemplation in an open area, envisioning in detail the orderly creations that might soon fill that place. Gain a +4 bonus on Fortitude saves against effects that would deal hit point damage.

2: Timely Absence (Su) Once per day as an immediate action when you would fail a saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points or fewer by an effect, you can disappear from reality altogether and avoid the immediate effects (not being hit or poisoned, for example). You leave behind a transparent afterimage, and at the beginning of your next turn, you reappear in your space (or the nearest available space if that is now occupied) and are staggered until the end of your turn.
3: Invert Entropy (Su) You take no penalties from energy drain, though you can still be killed if you accrue more negative levels than you have Hit Dice. Once per day as a move action, you can remove a number of your temporary negative levels equal to half your Hit Dice. For every 2 negative levels removed, you gain 10 temporary hit points and a cumulative +1 insight bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks; both effects last until the end of your next turn.
