Obedience

Perform a ritualized suicide by first scribing a note lambasting your enemies and then pretending to kill yourself via strangulation or cutting. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

Boons - [Demonic Obedience](feat:DemonicObedience)

Demoniac

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/store/games/roleplayingGames/p/pathfinderRPG/paizo/pathfinderChronicles/v5748btpy8hij">Book of the Damned - Volume 2: Lords of Chaos pg. 25</a>
1: Heretic's Hiss (Sp) command 3/day, whispering wind 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Heresy (Su) Once per day as a standard action, you can utter blasphemy or heresy against a single religion other than the worship of a demon lord. A worshiper of the targeted religion must be able to hear your utterance, or this ability fails. You gain SR equal to your HD + 11 against spells cast by worshipers of the religion you spoke out against-this SR lasts until you use this ability again to blaspheme a different religion (as long as you continue your daily obedience, this SR persists until you select a different religion).
3: Mass Suicide (Sp) You can cast weird once per day as a spell-like ability. Rather than assault the victims with images of fear, this ability assaults the targets with images and sensations of crippling sadness and despair. Those who succumb to the spell and die do so at their own hands. If no method of suicide is available for one who succumbs to this effect, the victim simply dies outright of sadness. This effect is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.

Boons - [Fiendish Obedience](feat:FiendishObedience)

Evangelist

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 92</a>
1: Hymn of Sorrow (Sp) ear-piercing scream  3/day, hold person 2/day, or crushing despair 1/day
2: Blasphemer's Piety (Ex) Your blasphemous soul adapts effortlessly to reflect the convictions of others. When you are targeted by an effect based on alignment or patron deity, you can choose to be treated as having the alignment and faith of the creature originating the effect (you don't need to know that creature's alignment or faith to make this choice). You can also be treated as having the faith of your target or targets when using a spell or effect dependent on patron deity. Making this choice does not require an action, or even awareness that you are being targeted (in which case the ability always functions as best benefits the character in that situation). In addition, you can select feats, traits, and other options dependent on worship of particular deities as though you were a worshiper of those deities. Once per week, you can choose to perform the obedience of any lawful or good deity with which you are familiar instead of Sifkesh's obedience. This still grants you your normal benefits from Sifkesh, not those from the other faith.
3: Baptism of Sin (Su) Your unholy magic infects the souls of mortal creatures, washing away their morality and drawing them into the Lady of Heresy's tender embrace. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting spells, that creature becomes filled with false but nevertheless convincing memories of having committed a horrific sin. A nonevil and nongood target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become staggered for 1 round, while a good target must succeed at this Will save or become nauseated for 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to baptism of sin for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.

Exalted

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 92</a>
1: Heretic's Hiss (Sp) command  3/day, whispering wind 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Heresy (Su) You take great delight in worrying at weaknesses in the dogma of other religions. Once per day as a standard action, you can utter blasphemy or heresy against a single religion other than the worship of a demon lord. A worshiper of the targeted religion must be able to hear your utterance, or this ability fails. You gain spell resistance equal to your Hit Dice + 11 against spells cast by worshipers of the religion you spoke out against. This spell resistance lasts until you use this ability again to blaspheme a different religion or until you fail to perform your daily obedience.
3: Mass Suicide (Sp) Your influence can drive entire groups of people to acts of self-destruction. You can cast weird once per day as a spell-like ability. Rather than assaulting the victims with images of fear, this ability assaults the targets with images and sensations of crippling sadness and despair. Those who succumb to the spell and die do so at their own hands. If no method of suicide is available for one who falls prey to this effect, the victim simply dies outright of sadness. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.

Sentinel

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 92</a>
1: Wallow in Despair (Sp) doom  3/day, miserable pity 2/day, or catatonia 1/day
2: Welcome the End (Sp) With a cooing nihilistic whisper, you cause a creature to kill itself, making its body lose the drive to maintain life. You can cast phantasmal killer three times per day as a spell-like ability, but rather than this functioning as an illusion (phantasm), this is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect. The victim must succeed at a Will save to resist the urge to end its life. On a failure, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or its body's life-sustaining autonomic processes irreparably and lethally shut down.
3: Broken Angel (Ex) Like that of your Abyssal mistress, your body has fallen to pieces. Your arms and legs do not directly attach to your body, instead floating near their original locations, while your torso sprouts angelic wings that keep it aloft. You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with perfect maneuverability. Your limbs can disassociate briefly from the whole to attack distant targets at a moment's notice, extending your melee reach by 15 feet, and attacks against you suffer a miss chance of 20% due to the gaps between your constantly shifting body parts. You are immune to effects that cause severed limbs or that arise from severed limbs (including the beheading effect of a vorpal sword) and also to bleed effects and bleed damage. You automatically stabilize when reduced to negative hit points.
