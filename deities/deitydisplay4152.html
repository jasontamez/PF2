Obedience

Drown a living creature in swamp water (or at the very least, in muddy water), then impale the dead body on a sharp branch so wild creatures can feast on it. After impaling the creature, you must spend the rest of your obedience meditating on the sound of fluid dripping from its sodden body. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saves against disease and poison caused by exposure to the jungle or creatures native to swamps.

1: Swamper's Boon (Sp) jump 3/day, summon swarm 2/day, or water walk 1/day
2: Warty Skin (Ex) Your skin grows thick and warty, increasing your base natural armor bonus by +3.
3: Summon Froghemoth (Sp) Once per day, you may summon a fiendish froghemoth as if using summon monster IX.

Boons - [Fiendish Obedience](feat:FiendishObedience)

Evangelist

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 54</a>
1: Swamp Secrets (Sp) obscuring mist  3/day, tree shape 2/day, or lily pad stride 1/day
2: Murky Gaze (Sp, Su) Gogunta has many eyes, and nothing escapes her glare. Your eyes take on a pale green-blue hue as you are granted a fraction of the power of her murky gaze. You gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks and can see through fog and mist as though they weren't there. While in swamp terrain, you ignore concealment and cover (including total cover) from vegetation and water. In addition, once per day when in swamp terrain, you can cast true seeing as a spell-like ability.
3: Fen Witchcraft (Sp, Su) As one of Gogunta's most powerful worshipers, you have been granted access to some of the most sinister powers of her faith. You are constantly under the effects of freedom of movement. In addition, once per day as a standard action, you can activate a drowning aura. Creatures within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Will save each round (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) or be unable to speak or breathe. A creature can still hold its breath, but the aura saps held breath as well-a creature in the aura can hold its breath only for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier before running out of air. Worshipers of Gogunta and creatures that don't breathe air are unaffected by this aura. Once activated, your drowning aura persists for 1 round per Hit Die.

Exalted

1: Swamper's Boon (Sp) jump 3/day, summon swarm 2/day, or water walk 1/day
2: Warty Skin (Ex) Just as the flesh of her favored minions, your skin grows thick and warty (or more warty than normal, in the case of a worshiper such as a boggard), increasing your base natural armor bonus by 3.
3: Summon Froghemoth (Sp) Once per day, you can summon a fiendish froghemoth as if using summon monster IX.

Sentinel

1: Plague of Frogs (Sp) summon monster I (1 fiendish poisonous frog) 3/day, summon monster II (1 fiendish giant frog or 1d3 fiendish poisonous frogs) 2/day, or rain of frogs 1/day
2: Boggard's Blessing (Ex) Your form becomes batrachian in aspect, like the frogfolk of the marshes. You gain the boggard's hold breath, sticky tongue, and terrifying croak abilities. In addition, you count as a boggard for the purpose of effects, including prerequisites (although you lose access to related options if you haven't performed your obedience). If you are a boggard, you instead gain a permanent +2 profane bonus to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and the DC of your terrifying croak ability, and you can use your terrifying croak ability at will.
3: Kiss of Gogunta (Sp) Calling out to the Song of the Swamp, you transform those who oppose you into frogs and toads. Any number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save or be transformed into Diminutive frogs or toads, as per baleful polymorph but heightened to a 9th-level spell. As with baleful polymorph, any creature that fails its Fortitude save must then succeed at a Will save to retain its mental faculties. Any creature that intentionally touches a creature transformed this way must succeed at the same saving throws or be transformed as well; a creature that kisses a transformed creature automatically fails its Fortitude save against this effect but automatically succeeds at its Will save. This ability can be used once per day.
