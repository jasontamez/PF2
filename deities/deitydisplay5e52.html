Obedience

Persuade a creature to allow you to inflict a small amount of pain on it. This can be as subtle as thin needles under the skin or as overt as a lashing with a whip- whatever the subject agrees to. If you can legally procure an individual, such as through legalized slavery, you may use a purchased subject instead. If no suitable individuals can be located, coil a spiked chain into a nest and kneel on it, letting your weight sink your knees into the spikes. Whip your own back while chanting praises to Zon-Kuthon. Gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against spells that deal hit point damage.

Divine Gift

Nethys Note: See <a href="rulese221.html?Name=Divine%20Gifts&amp;Category=Role%20of%20the%20Divine">here</a> for details on how to gain a Divine Gift
The recipient can perform a 10-minute prayer (this can be part of her daily ritual to prepare spells) involving self-flagellation or other forms of self-inflicted pain to replace her body with a shadowy duplicate of her true form for 24 hours. During this time, the character exists as a strange, shadowy incarnation of her normal self, and is immune to precision damage and bleed, fear, negative energy, and pain effects, and she treats all piercing and slashing damage as nonlethal damage. The character is treated as undead for the purposes of determining the effects of damage or healing caused by negative or positive energy.

1: Unbending Faith (Sp) protection from chaos 3/day, arrow of law 2/day, or pain strike 1/day
2: Strike of the Endless (Ex) Three times per day, you can make a strike of the endless against an opponent. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack, and if your attack misses, the strike is wasted. You make an unarmed strike against your target, and if you hit, your target must succeed at a Fortitude save (with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This ability doesn't work against creatures without eyes or who see by means other than vision (such as with blindsight or tremorsense). If you have a ki pool, you may spend 1 point from it to increase the saving throw DC of this ability by 4.
3: Agonizing Blow (Ex) Once per day, you can make an unarmed strike that deals agonizing pain to a single target. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack, and if your attack misses, the strike is wasted. You make an unarmed strike against your target, and if you hit, your target must succeed at a Will save (with a DC equal to 10+ 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage each round for the next 10 rounds as terrible pain rips through its body. Additionally, during those 10 rounds, your target is nauseated, and you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks against it. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it instead takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per round for the next 10 rounds, and is sickened for those 10 rounds. If you have a ki pool, you may spend 1 point from it to increase the saving throw DC of this ability by 4.

1: Obscurement (Sp) obscuring mist 3/day, invisibility 2/day, or deeper darkness 1/day
2: Path of Darkness (Sp) Once per day, you can use shadow walk as a spell-like ability. When you reach your desired endpoint along the shadow path, you materialize directly where you desire instead of being shunted in a random direction as you normally would. Furthermore, if you use this ability on an unwilling creature, the creature takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.
3: Fleshrending Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon an interlocutor kyton (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 174) to serve you. You gain telepathy with the interlocutor to a range of 100 feet. The kyton follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before it vanishes back to its home on the Plane of Shadow. The interlocutor refuses to follow any commands that would cause it to act in an overly good or chaotic way. Such commands earn a spiky snarl of disapproval, or could even cause the kyton to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.

1: Envious Death (Sp) compel hostility 3/day, touch of bloodletting 2/day, or vampiric touch 1/day
2: Rending Trip (Ex) When you successfully trip an opponent using a spiked chain, your tripped opponent immediately provokes an attack of opportunity from you. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on any attacks of opportunity you make against opponents you have tripped with a spiked chain within the last round.
3: Sight of Perfect Night (Ex) All the training you have done in perfect darkness has left you with the uncanny ability to sense your surroundings even in the blackest night. You gain blindsense with a range of 20 feet. If you already have blindsense with a range of 20 feet or greater, instead increase the range of your blindsense by 10 feet.

Zon-Kuthon's Flensing

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdy?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Weapon-Masters-Handbook">Weapon Master's Handbook pg. 11</a>
Zon-Kuthon invites all mortals to join in inflicting and suffering pain.

Initial Benefit: Once per round, when you hit a foe with a spiked chain, you can twist the chain so it painfully flenses both of you. You and your target are both sickened for 1 round, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be sickened for an additional 1d4+1 rounds.

Advanced Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +10.

Advanced Benefit: Whenever you sicken a foe with pain using a spiked chain (whether by flensing, as a dirty trick combat maneuver, or otherwise), the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom bonus) or be nauseated for the first round of the duration.
