Obedience

Smash an assortment of items worth at least 10 gp, preferably something fragile, aesthetically beautiful, or with significance to a good-aligned deity (particularly Sarenrae). The more devout servants of Rovagug seek out and hoard particularly expensive, artistic, or rare items, such as fine bottles of wine or delicate curios, to smash during their obedience. Roll in the shards of the destroyed items, howling and shouting praises and curses invoking the Rough Beast, until the shards draw blood and your lungs ache. Gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against objects.

1: Agent of the Beast (Sp) protection from good 3/day, align weapon (evil only) 2/day, or magic circle against good 1/day
2: Destructive Spell (Su) By calling on the rage of the Rough Beast, you gain the ability to deal terrific damage with your spells. You can use this ability when casting a spell that deals hit point damage and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less. You can choose to cast the spell as a full-round action to gain a +4 bonus to its save DC. In addition, you treat all 1s rolled on your damage dice for the spell as 2s instead.
3: The Destroyer's Gifts (Su) You feel the touch of an alien presence at the corner of your mind, as if something hungry and hateful had taken root and now holds a measure of dominion over your thoughts. You gain an extra spell slot of the highest spell level you can cast. If you prepare spells, you can prepare one spell in this spell slot every day from the Chaos or Destruction domain spell lists. You may choose any spell from the lists even if you are an arcane spellcaster, and you can change this spell selection every time you prepare spells. If you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can cast one spell from either of the domain spell lists as if it was on your known spells list. You can cast this spell only once per day, though you can choose a different spell to cast each time you regain your spells for the day.

1: Destructive Force (Sp) break 3/day, bull's strength 2/day, or shatter 1/day
2: Bestow Destructive Smite (Su) You can bestow the Destruction domain's destructive smite granted power upon an ally. As a standard action, you can spend one use of your destructive smite to grant its power to any ally within 30 feet, channeling into him the erratic force of Rovagug's rage. Your ally must make the destructive smite within 1 round of being granted the power or its use is wasted. Your ally uses your level to calculate the power of the destructive smite. If you don't have access to the Destruction domain, you instead gain access to the destructive smite granted power but only for your personal use, as normal.
3: Apocalyptic Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can tear a violent breach between your location and the Outer Rifts-the deepest, foulest pits of the Abyss-and summon forth a pair of nyogoth qlippoth (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 224). You gain telepathy with the creatures to a range of 100 feet, and they follow your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back into the Abyss. The qlippoth don't follow commands that would cause them to act in overtly good or lawful ways. Such commands not only earn terrifying roars from the creatures, but could cause the nyogoths to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.

Sentinel

1: Inexorable Death (Sp) doom 3/day, death knell 2/day, or inflict serious wounds 1/day
2: Wicked Claws (Ex) Your fingernails grow into thick, jagged talons, unevenly matched and vaguely resembling the spurs of a giant insect or the fangs of some unspeakable beast. You gain a pair of claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks that deal 1d8 points of slashing damage if you're Medium or 1d6 points of damage if you're Small.
3: Disintegrating Blow (Sp) Once per day, you can channel a glimpse of Rovagug's hatred through your weapon, recreating the effects of disintegrate. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. On a hit, the target is affected as if targeted by disintegrate cast by a wizard of a level equal to your Hit Dice (maximum CL 20th). If your attack misses, the disintegrate effect is wasted.

Antipaladin Code

The antipaladins of Rovagug seek their master's Great Awakening, and bend all their efforts toward the eventual decay of the prison that holds their god. Their code is simple, brutal, and direct, and its tenets include the following adages. <ul><li>All things must be destroyed, but the tools of destruction will be destroyed last.</li><li>The beautiful die first. Their loss wreaks havoc in the hearts of those who love.</li><li>All is vanity before the tide of destruction.</li><li>The world is a lie. The only truth is oblivion, born of storm and horror.</li><li>Torture is needless delay. I give the gift of a quick death.</li><li>I will die standing.</li></ul>

Divine Fighting Technique



Rovagug's Thunder

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology pg. 30</a>
Most copies of Ravage and Ruin, the divine fighting manual of the Rough Beast Rovagug, are scrawled in blood upon flensed skins by orc priests-and indeed the vile techniques described within originated from the Hold of Belkzen not long after the orcs first seized that land as their own. Reviled across the Inner Sea, Ravage and Ruin sees additional use among savage Ulfen clans who have fallen to the Rough Beast's urges to become corrupt, lunatic cannibals who relish despoiling beauty in Rovagug's name.

Initial Benefit: Whenever you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against an opponent, you deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. In addition, whenever your dirty trick combat maneuver check beats an opponent's CMD by 5 or more, you can forgo increasing the duration of your condition by 1 or more rounds to instead impose a -2 penalty on all of that opponent's Charisma-based checks. This penalty doesn't stack with itself, and it lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 minute) or until the target receives any form of magical healing.

Advanced Prerequisites: Power Attack, Divine Fighting Technique, base attack bonus +10.

Optional Replacement: A chaotic evil barbarian of at least 10th level who worships Rovagug can replace a rage power with the following advanced benefit without meeting its prerequisites.

Advanced Benefit: Anytime you use Power Attack with a great axe or a natural attack, you ignore an amount of the target's hardness or damage reduction equal to the penalty Power Attack imparts to your attack roll. This benefit stacks with Penetrating Strike and Greater Penetrating Strike.
