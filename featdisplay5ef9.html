You can travel between magic plants and plants with which you have an affinity.

Prerequisites: Con 13, character level 7th, plant type.

Benefit: Once per day, you can step into an adjacent plant with which you share affinity, then exit from a plant of the same kind. This functions as <a href="spelldisplaydc68.html?ItemName=tree%20stride">tree stride</a> with the following changes: the duration is 1 round; the transport range is 200 feet per character level; transporting yourself is a standard action; and a <a href="racesdisplaya15c.html?ItemName=Ghoran">ghoran</a> using this ability can pass through any living tree, while a <a href="racesdisplay427d.html?ItemName=Vine%20Leshy">vine leshy</a> can pass through any living vine. You can also enter any magically created or enhanced plants, such as those produced by <a href="spelldisplay7b44.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20thorns">wall of thorns</a> or plants affected by <a href="spelldisplaye879.html?ItemName=entangle">entangle</a>, then exit from either another similar plant or a plant with which you have an affinity.

Special: The GM determines plant affinity for non-ghoran and non-vine leshy plant creatures.
