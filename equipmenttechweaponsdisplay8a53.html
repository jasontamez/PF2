Description

A beam cannon is an immense version of one of the six more common beam rifle types. Beam cannons are generally referred to by type as summarized below. In addition to the standard automatic firing mode options (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide 20), a beam cannon can be used to launch a devastating blast of energy. This is a full-round action, and these blasts can't be used to make iterative attacks. When a beam cannon is used to launch a blast, no attack roll is made-you simply target a 20-foot-radius spread within a maximum range of 300 feet. You must have line of effect to your target when you launch a blast; if the blast impacts a solid object before reaching the target area, it explodes at that point. All creatures caught in the blast radius take 6d6 points of damage of the energy type appropriate to the cannon (Reflex DC 14 half). Each blast also has an additional effect as determined by the type of cannon. Firing a blast from a beam cannon consumes 10 charges.

Arc Cannon: An arc cannon deals electricity damage. Against metallic targets or creatures wearing medium or heavy metal armor, an arc cannon grants a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, and the save DC against its blast mode increases by 2. An arc cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.

EMP Cannon: An EMP cannon fires electromagnetic energy that cannot harm most living creatures. It deals 4d6 points of electricity damage against robots, and half as much damage against androids and creatures with cybernetic implants. A creature that takes damage from a critical hit by an EMP cannon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds. An EMP cannon's blast deals 8d6 points of electricity damage of the same electromagnetic nature. An EMP cannon costs 58,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 33.

Gravity Cannon: A gravity cannon fires a beam of gravitons that deals force damage. Any creature that takes damage from its blast and fails the resulting Reflex save is encased in a shell of force energy for 1d4 rounds, as if by a telekinetic sphere. You can use a gravity cannon to move a sphere so created (at a speed of 30 feet, up to a range of 300 feet away) as a move action-every round during which you move a sphere in this way consumes 1 charge from the gravity cannon, but also maintains the moved sphere's duration for an additional round.

In addition to the typical firing modes for a beam cannon, a gravity cannon can be fired on a sustained setting. When used in this mode, the gravity cannon can be used to move and manipulate objects from a distance, similar to the sustained force or combat maneuver versions of a telekinesis spell. (A gravity cannon can't duplicate the violent thrust option of a telekinesis spell.) The gravity cannon uses 1 charge per round in this mode, and can move objects weighing no more than 500 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 19 Reflex save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the cannon uses the wielder's CMB + 8, but uses her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or Dexterity modifier. A gravity cannon is a technological artifact.

Laser Cannon: A laser cannon deals fire damage. All attacks fired from it pass through transparent barriers, but treat fog, smoke, and other clouds as cover; see the laser pistol on page 25 of the Technology Guide for more information. A laser cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.

Sonic Cannon: A sonic cannon deals sonic damage. A creature that is critically hit by a sonic cannon or fails its saving throw against the cannon's blast must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be permanently deafened. A sonic cannon costs 58,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 33.

Zero Cannon: A zero cannon deals cold damage. A creature that is critically hit by a zero cannon or fails its saving throw against the cannon's blast must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or become staggered for 1 round. A zero cannon costs 40,000 gp and has a Craft DC of 31.
