Way signs provide information about the territory and, if correctly interpreted, can provide bonus Discovery Points. A way sign could be as simple as a vantage point that offers a glimpse of a location from a distance or a hidden path toward a sought-after goal, or it might itself be a reward for finding a location. Way signs can even be earned or uncovered in advance of exploring a region-if a PC researches the territory the party intends to explore in a library, she might uncover a set of old maps or a traveler's journal that provides clues to navigating the territory and thus serves as a way sign.

When designing a territory, you'll usually want to include at least one or two way signs, or as many as 10 in cases of large territories. If you're using hex-based exploration, treat each significant terrain feature as a territory for the purpose of deciding how many way signs to include, rather than treating each hex as its own territory. Each way sign should have a trigger that results in its discovery by the party, be it attempting to recall lore about a region, gathering information in a nearby settlement, using flight to scout the lay of the land, or uncovering an old map or journal discussing the region. Each way sign should also have an associated skill check and DC to successfully gain information or interpret the clue. For a simple way sign, this DC should equal the territory's CR + 10. For a moderately complex way sign, the DC should be equal to the territory's CR + 15. For complex way signs, the DC should be equal to the territory's CR + 20.
