Description

This simple ceramic flask looks like any other normal container for serving sake, or rice wine. If the flask's silver stopper is removed and the command word spoken, up to 1 gallon of sake can be poured from the flask per round. In addition, once per day, a character can drink directly from the flask to gain the effects of a potion, determined randomly. Roll 1d6 on the following table to determine the type of potion.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>d6</td><td>Roll Potion type</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>heroism</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>cure moderate wounds</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>enlarge person</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>reduce person</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>lesser restoration</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>rage</td></tr></table>
This potion cannot be poured out or saved for later use; it must be drunk, and the potion's effects take place immediately.
