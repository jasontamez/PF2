The goddess <a href="deitydisplay5b20.html?ItemName=Sarenrae">Sarenrae</a> welcomes all who seek good in the world into her fold, and some goblins are drawn to worship her, in part due to her incarnation as a giant ball of fire.

Prerequisites: <a href="racesdisplay7cda.html?ItemName=Goblin">Goblin</a>, worshipper of <a href="deitydisplay5b20.html?ItemName=Sarenrae">Sarenrae</a>.

Benefit: If the sun is visible, you can spend 1 round performing a wild dance in worship of the Dawnflower. Starting at the beginning of your next turn, allies who can see you gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your character level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). At 9th level, this bonus increases to +2.
