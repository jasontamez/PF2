You are more aware of the supernatural forces that influence the world-and, consequently, are more easily noticed by them.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will.</a>

Benefit: Select one specific category of spirit: fey, outsiders, or undead (including haunts). You gain a +1 bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks against those creatures. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +2 for that skill.

You also gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class against creatures of the chosen type, and a +1 insight bonus on Will saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of creatures of the chosen type. Any condition that causes you to lose your Dexterity bonus to AC also causes you to lose the AC and saving throw bonuses from this feat.

Special: You shine like a light to the eyes of spirits. Fey, outsiders, and undead creatures gain a +2 bonus on Perception checks to notice you.

You can select this feat up to three times. Each time you do, you must select a different creature type for this feat's benefit.
