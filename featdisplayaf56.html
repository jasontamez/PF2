You have burned in the hottest flames, and your flesh bears the proof-fire holds little fear for you anymore.

Prerequisites: Knocked unconscious or killed by fire damage at least 10 times.

Benefit: Your history with fire has attracted the attention of a powerful but mysterious guardian spirit from the Elemental Plane of Water. This spirit grants you fire resistance 5, and you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist fire effects.
