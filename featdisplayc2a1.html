Horn Rider's Charge - Feats







Horn Rider's Charge (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 164</a>
When the animal you're lashed to charges, you use its momentum in your own attack.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay01f9.html?ItemName=Horn%20Rider">Horn Rider</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  Whenever you're lashed into a horn harness and you ready an action to make a melee attack against the target of a charge made by the creature you're lashed to, you gain the attack bonus for charging and your attack deals double damage (or triple damage with a lance). This benef it does not stack with the benef it of Spirited Charge.
