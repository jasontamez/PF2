You are an experienced leader among ritual casters.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana, history, planes, and religion) 1 rank.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on skill checks to perform occult rituals, and on Intelligence checks to learn the method of casting an occult ritual (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 208). If you are a ritual's primary caster, the DC for saving throws against the ritual's effects is 2 higher. If the ritual has a minimum number of required secondary casters, that number is decreased by 1.
