Description

The heady vapors of this coiled incense facilitate a deep
meditative trance. When an oracle lights a coil of incense
of transcendence and then spends 8 hours praying and
meditating nearby, she can replace one of her revelations
with another revelation. The new revelation must be one
available to her (such as from the same mystery) and must
be available at the same class level as the original revelation
(for example, she cannot replace a revelation available at 1st
level with a revelation requiring a minimum of 7th level). If
she replaces a revelation that is a prerequisite for another
revelation or ability, she cannot use that other revelation or
ability while under the influence of the incense.


The coil of incense burns for 8 hours. Its effects persist for 24
hours, after which the oracle's original revelations return.
