Description

This rancid, bubbling tonic is mud-colored and reeks of sweat, gore, and decay. Upon drinking a dose of trollblood elixir, the imbiber gains fast healing 5. This fast healing is even capable of reattaching a severed limb that is pressed against its stump for 1 round, as long as the limb has been severed for no more than 1 hour and is essentially intact. The effects of trollblood elixir last 1 minute; during this time, the imbiber is nauseated. Each round, the imbiber can choose to prematurely end the elixir's effects by succeeding at a DC 10 Fortitude save as a full-round action. Trollblood elixir does not affect objects or nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead.
