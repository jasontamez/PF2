Once your map is inked and colored, it's essentially ready for play. All that's left is to tag it with number locations that key the map to the encounter descriptions in your notes. Using a number key helps to keep your map's details from being obscured by descriptive words. If possible, use a pen of a different color than anything else on your map so the number tags stand out and are easy to see- alternatively, you can circle the number tags or mark them with a highlighter.
