You know how to balance a polearm perfectly, striking with artful, yet deadly precision.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (glaive)</a>, must be a worshiper of Shelyn.

Benefit: You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a glaive sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. When wielding a glaive, you can treat it as a one-handed piercing or slashing melee weapon and as if you were not making attacks with your off-hand for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist's or swashbuckler's precise strike).

As a move action, you can shorten your grip on the glaive, treating it as though it lacked the reach weapon property. You can adjust your grip to grant the weapon the reach property as a move action.
