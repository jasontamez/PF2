Element aether; Type utility (Su); Level 3; Burn 0
You can gather strands of aether twisted and warped by your experiences in the Spellscar Desert, and wind them so tightly that they explode, creating a primal magic event with a CR equal to your kineticist level. See pages 12-13 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic for more information on primal magic events.

Attunement

See the book Occult Realms for more information on elemental saturation and attunements.

To locate the aether saturations deep within the desert, a telekineticist must first locate an etheric storm. Afterwards, she must succeed at both a DC 20 Knowledge (arcana) check and a DC 20 Survival check and spend 1d4 hours navigating the wasteland from the storm's origin point to the saturation that spawned it. She can then learn the primal aether wild talent.
