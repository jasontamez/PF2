Ward Aspects - Hunter








Ward Aspects


Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01w1y">Wilderness Origins</a>
When a character in tune with nature comes upon an area that a kami could ward but that is lacking a guardian, she has the option of making that area her ward in a symbiotic relationship. Whenever a character with the <a href="classdisplaye64c.html?ItemName=Hunter">animal focus</a> class feature is within 100 feet per class level of one of the wards listed below, she can use the associated ward aspect instead of one of the normal options for her animal focus class feature. Hunters can apply the benefits of a ward aspect to themselves, but not to their animal companions.

If a character with the animal focus class feature spends 30 minutes meditating while within 10 feet per class level of the ward, she attunes herself to that ward. A character attuned to a ward can use the associated ward aspect while within 1 mile per class level. A character can be attuned to only one ward at a time, but depending on her surroundings, she could choose from among multiple wards. A character with the second animal focus class feature can still only use one ward aspect at a time, no matter how many aspects she has available to her.

The following ward aspects are available to characters who meet the conditions described above.

Road: The creature gains a foot enhancement bonus to its base speed while running, charging, or withdrawing. This bonus increases to  feet at 8th level and  feet at 15th level.

Shrine: The creature gains a  enhancement bonus to Wisdom. This bonus increases to  at 8th level and  at 15th level.

Tree: The creature gains a  competence bonus on saving throws against death effects and effects that deal negative energy damage. This bonus increases to  at 8th level and  at 15th level.

Waymarker: The creature gains a  competence bonus on attack rolls with improvised weapons. This bonus increases to  at 8th level and  at 15th level.

Well: The creature gains a  shield bonus to AC. This bonus increases to  at 8th level and  at 15th level.
