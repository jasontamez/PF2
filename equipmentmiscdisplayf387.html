Description

Gathlains have learned to domesticate giant bees (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 43), which they use to travel long distances. Extra queens from a hive's brood are saved and trained for hauling heavier equipment or a retinue of gathlains. Bees require an exotic saddle, which is a sort of basket that places the rider underneath the bee's abdomen, where it protects the rider as if he were a bee larva.
