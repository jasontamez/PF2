Description

This unique instrument is composed of a 1-foot-long, sealed glass tube filled with a clear alchemical solution. Eight smaller glass vessels, each containing a different uniquely colored liquid, float within the primary tube. As temperatures change in the atmosphere surrounding the haunt detector, the interior vessels rise and fall in proportion to the density of their respective liquids. Observation of a haunt detector's fluctuations grants a +2 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice haunts or the presence of creatures with the cold or fire subtypes.
