Colin Fletcher

Colin vigilantly guards his town, and is quick to respond if any visitors start fights or cause trouble with locals.

Combat Encounters: Colin fires a warning shot from a rooftop to distract unruly adventurers in town, or uses a tanglefoot bag on a PC who's obviously drunk, raging, or out of control.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Colin is the eyes and ears for his town, and is a source of valuable information about the comings and goings of strangers.
