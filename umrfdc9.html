A creature with this ability can nauseate creatures it damages. Any living creature that takes damage from a creature with the distraction ability is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Constitution modifier) negates the effect.

Format: distraction (DC 14)
Location: Special Attacks.
