The ophidian source of your bloodline has more to do with stealth and assassination than it does with leadership and alliances.

Associated Bloodline: Serpentine.

Bloodline Arcana: You gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics, Climb, and Stealth checks.

Bloodline Powers: The stink of poison taints your magic.

Envenom (Su): At 3rd level, as a swift action, you can lick or bite a melee weapon to imbue it with 1 dose of black adder venom. The poison's DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one additional time per day for every three additional levels. The poison cannot be removed or stored, and the weapon loses the benefit of the poison after the first successful attack or 1 hour has passed. The bloodline power replaces serpentfriend.
