Your skill at riding helps your mount avoid attacks.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat</a>, Handle Animal 5 ranks, Ride 5 ranks, Lastwall affinity.

Benefit: Once per round when your mount must make a saving throw, you can make a Ride check as an immediate action. Your mount makes its save if your Ride check result is greater than the DC of the opponent's attack.
