The arcanist can tie her spells to the rigid order of Axis, giving them predictable results. As a swift action, she can spend 1 point from her arcane reservoir. For the next minute, her spells deal damage as if she had rolled exactly average on all of the dice, rounded down. To find the average, treat the arcanist as if she had rolled 2-1/2 on all d4s, 3-1/2 on all d6s, 4-1/2 on all d8s, 5-1/2 on all d10s, and 6-1/2 on all d12s. For example, if a 3rd-level arcanist used this exploit and cast burning hands, the spell would deal a total of 7 points of damage.
