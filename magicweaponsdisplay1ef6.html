Description

A red flame motif stands out along the length of this +1 flaming whip. It deals additional damage whenever it is used to perform a non-damaging combat maneuver, such as trip or drag. Once the combat maneuver is resolved, the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Objects moved by the whip (through a disarm combat maneuver, for example) take this same damage.
