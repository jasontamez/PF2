The desert stalker snares his prey and bleeds it dry.

Arkesh

Arkesh loves the desert, its people, and their traditions, and hates those who would change or exploit any of these. He might let a water caravan run by foreigners pass, but would kill a similar group bringing exotic goods to tempt desert people into strange new ways.

Combat Encounters: Arkesh attacks the PCs for a perceived affront to his territory or traditions.

Roleplaying Suggestions: If PCs respect the desert, Arkesh might rescue them during a sandstorm, guide them past a dangerous monster, or explain in detail the hazards of the wilds.
