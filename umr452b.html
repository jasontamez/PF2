Paralysis renders the victim immobile. Paralyzed creatures cannot move, speak, or take any physical actions. The creature is rooted to the spot, frozen and helpless. Paralysis works on the body, and a character can usually attempt to resist it with a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the paralyzing creature's racial HD + that creature's Constitution modifier; the DC is given in the creature's description). Unlike hold person and similar effects, a paralysis effect does not allow a new save each round. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can't swim and may drown. The duration of the paralysis varies and is included in the creature's description.

Format: paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 18)
Location: Special Attacks and individual attacks.
