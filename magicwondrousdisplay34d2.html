Description

These massive pauldrons take the shape of a pair of clenched
fists made of beaten bronze. They bestow a +4 bonus on CMD,
and grant the wearer the ferocity ability (Bestiary 300). On
command, the wearer can increase its size, as though subject
to an enlarge person spell, and can revert to regular size with
another command. Three times per day, as an immediate
action after the pauldrons' wearer kills an opponent, the
wearer gains the benefit of the deadly juggernaut spell
(Ultimate Combat) for 1 minute.
