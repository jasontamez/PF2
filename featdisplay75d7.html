You have learned how to unlock the power of your spells, combining them with your mythic power.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast spells.

Benefit:  You can learn a number of mythic spells equal to your tier and can expend mythic power when casting them to enhance the results. To select a mythic spell, you must be able to cast the non-mythic version or have it on your list of spells known. Every time you gain a new tier, you can select an additional mythic spell.

Special:  You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you select this feat, you must select different spells.
