Description

This glass teardrop hangs on a platinum chain and can be
used once per day to grant a surge of power. This surge can be
used in one of two ways. As a swift action, the wearer of the
amulet can make one melee or ranged attack at his highest
attack bonus. Alternatively, if the wearer of the amulet has a
ki pool, he can instead focus on the power of the amulet as a
full-round action and regain two ki points.
