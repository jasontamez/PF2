Description

This unholy symbol is carved entirely from human bone. When the wielder uses this unholy symbol as a focus for the Command Undead feat, he gains a +1 profane bonus to the DC of that feat.

Good creatures of 5 Hit Dice or less that attempt to touch the symbol must make a DC 15 Will save or be shaken for 1 round. Deliberate use of a symbol of unholy command is an evil act.
