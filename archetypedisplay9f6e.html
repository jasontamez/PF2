Revelations: A Keleshite prophet must take the following revelation at 1st level.

Divining Dance (Su) Once per day, you can perform a sacred meditative dance that gives you great clarity of mind and prepares you for what lies ahead. This dance must last for at least 1 minute, uninterrupted, and you can take no other actions during the dance.

When you dance, attempt a Perform (dance) check; the results of the check determine the benefits you gain for the next 24 hours, as listed below. You can always choose the benefit from a lower result, if you wish (for example, if your Perform [dance] result is 15, you can choose to gain a +1 bonus on your divinations' saving throws instead of choosing to use augury once as a spell-like ability). <table class="inner"><tr><td>Perform (Dance) Result</td><td> Benefit</td></tr> <tr><td>0-9</td><td>Increase the saving throw DC of any divination spells you cast by 1.</td></tr> <tr><td>10-19</td><td>Once in the next 24 hours, as an immediate action, you can use augury as a spell-like ability, using your oracle level as your caster level.</td></tr> <tr><td>20-29</td><td>Once in the next 24 hours, you can use divination as a spell-like ability, using your oracle level as your caster level.
