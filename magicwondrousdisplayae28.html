Description

This drab gray cloak billows about as if blown by an invisible wind. Once per day, the wearer can use doom, which causes a deathlike shadow to fleetingly cross the wearer's face.

If Groetus is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can use false life. If the wearer successfully delivers a coup de grace against a dying foe while false life is active, the wearer's temporary hit points from the false life effect increase by 1 (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points). The dying creature must have at least as many Hit Dice as the wearer for this effect to occur.
