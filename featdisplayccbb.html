You have passed the grueling Test of Summoning and graduated from the Acadamae.

Prerequisites: Specialist wizard 1st; cannot have conjuration as a forbidden school.

Benefit: Whenever you cast a prepared arcane spell from the conjuration (summoning) school that takes longer than a standard action to cast, reduce the casting time by one round (to a minimum casting time of one standard action). Casting a spell in this way is taxing and requires a Fortitude save (DC 15 + spell level) to resist becoming fatigued.
