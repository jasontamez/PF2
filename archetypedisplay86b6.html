The sight of yellow sails on the Inner Sea signals the approach of a ship from Okeno, home port of the most ruthless and feared of all slaving operations. Most who see these sails flee in terror, but some freedom fighters actually endeavor to be captured, knowing that being taken to Stonespine Island in manacles is the easiest way to infiltrate the city, liberate other slaves, and lead them to freedom.

Covert Commander (Ex):  An Okeno liberator grants all allies within 30 feet who are in her line of sight (but not herself ) a +1 competence bonus on Disguise and Stealth checks. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

Catch Off-Guard (Ex):  At 4th level, the Okeno liberator is adept at improvising weapons. She gains Catch Off-Guard as a bonus feat. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.
