Description

This mask is white on one side and black on the other, with glittering gem lenses covering the eyes. Up to three times per day, the wearer can change the energy damage of a fire spell she casts to cold, a cold spell to fire, an acid spell to electricity, or an electricity spell to acid. All other effects of the spell are unchanged (for example, an ice storm changed to fire damage still deals bludgeoning damage and bestows a penalty on Perception checks). The mask affects only spells up to 3rd level.
