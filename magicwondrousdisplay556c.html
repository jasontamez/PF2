Description

An apparatus of the crab is a metallic
magical vehicle. When unoccupied,
it appears to be a large, sealed iron
barrel big enough to hold two Medium
creatures. Close examination, and a DC 20
Perception check, reveals a secret catch
that opens a hatch at one end. Anyone
who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled)
levers and seating for two Medium or Small occupants. These
levers allow those inside to activate and control the apparatus’s
movements and actions.


<table class="inner"><tr><td>Lever (1d10)</td><td>Lever Function</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Extend/retract legs and tail</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Uncover/cover forward porthole</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Uncover/cover side portholes</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Extend/retract pincers and feelers</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Snap pincers</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Move forward/backward</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Turn left/right</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Open/close "eyes" with continual
flame inside</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Rise/sink in water</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Open/close hatch</td></tr></table>
Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever
may be operated more than once per round. However,
since two characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move
and attack in the same round. The device can function in
water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew
of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single
occupant).


When active, an apparatus of the crab has the following
