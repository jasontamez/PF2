You have learned to use deception and trickery to misdirect your opponent's weapon attack.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplayc704.html?ItemName=Deceitful">Deceitful</a>, Bluff 4 ranks.

Benefit: While you are using the total defense action, if a melee attack would still hit your AC, you can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to the foe's attack roll as an immediate action. If you succeed at the check, you negate the attack (treat it as a miss). If the attack still hits, you cannot use this feat against the same opponent for 24 hours.
