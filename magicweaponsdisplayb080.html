Description

When this +3 arrow strikes a creature, it explodes in a small cloud of red dust and deals nonlethal damage. The creature struck must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be charmed by the wielder as charm monster. Alternatively, the user can inscribe the name of another creature into the arrow shaft; in this case, the arrow's victim instead becomes charmed by the named creature on a failed save. Inscribing the arrow takes 10 minutes.
