You relish hot climates, as the equatorial heat does not sap your strength.

Prerequisites: Desert Dweller or Jungle Survivalist.

Benefit: You treat hot environments (Core Rulebook 444) as though they were one step less severe; if you have a similar ability from another feat (like Desert Dweller), the benefits stack and you treat hot conditions as if they were two steps less severe. You do not take a penalty on Constitution checks for wearing armor in hot climates.
