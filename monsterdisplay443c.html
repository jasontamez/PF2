Special Abilities

Copper Boar Form (Su) When a chalkost uses its change shape ability, it can turn into a boar with metallic flesh, coppery bristles, and glistening steel tusks. In this form, a chalkost retains its damage reduction and energy resistances. The copper boar has the same statistics as a normal boar, but its natural armor bonus is +6 and its gore attack deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit.

Dwarf Blood (Ex) A chalkost counts as a dwarf for any effect related to race, and has the hardy, slow and steady, and stability dwarven racial traits.

Shock Cestus (Su) As a free action, a chalkost can summon or dismiss a masterwork cestus on one of its hands. While wielded by the chalkost, the cestus deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity damage on a successful hit. If the cestus is given away or taken, the chalkost loses this ability until it reclaims its weapon.

Description

A chalkost is a perfect dwarven soul that serves as a laborer and crafter in Torag's divine realm. Blessed with hardiness, fine weapons, and an incorrigible spirit, a chalkost is a tireless and loyal servant, capable of forging new arms for angels or defending the plane against fiendish invaders. Said to have been created from the souls of particularly skilled and heroic dwarves, each chalkost shares a mutual affinity for one mortal dwarven clan, observing and guiding its members like an honored ancestor. So close is this relationship that the name of a particular chalkost is often passed down from priest to priest and family to family, so that some of these divine beings have aided clans for generations. Chalkosts have a close relationship with dwarven paladins and other noble dwarven warriors, and it is considered a special honor for mortal dwarves to ride a boar-form chalkost into battle.

A chalkost looks like an attractive, copper-haired dwarf wearing an open-faced helm with stylized boar tusks and armed with a hammer-tipped cestus. Male chalkosts have long beards, while females have long braids. The gender of a chalkost associated with a given dwarven clan generally matches the gender of the clan's leaders.

Chalkosts stand just over 5 feet tall and weigh about 230 pounds.
