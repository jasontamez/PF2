Special Abilities

Bound Spirits (Su) A nemhain is
surrounded by a whirling cloud
of spirits that are bound to her-often the
spirits of close relatives or friends she had in life.
As a swift action, she can direct these bound spirits
to strike at any creature within 30 feet as a ranged touch
attack (with an attack bonus of +21). These spirits may
be used to cause damage as if the nemhain had touched
the target with her incorporeal touch, or they can be used
to deliver a harm or slay living effect. Using these spirits
to deliver one of these spell-like abilities is a swift action;
the nemhain does not need to take a standard action to
cast the spell-like ability, but it still counts against the
number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability.
The nemhain can also send these spirits as a group up to 1
mile away to act as scouts; they have a fly speed of 60 feet
(perfect). She can observe and listen through them, but as
long as they don't share her space, she can't use them to
deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are impervious
to almost all attacks and magic, save the following: dispel
evil, raise dead, or resurrection. Such spells cause the spirits
to vanish and to be useless to the nemhain for 1 hour. True
resurrection makes the spirits useless for 24 hours.
Profane Regeneration (Su) This ability functions like
regeneration except the nemhain possesses it despite the fact
that she lacks a Constitution score. A nemhain reduced to 0
hit points is staggered instead of destroyed while her profane
regeneration is active. As long as her profane regeneration
is active, a nemhain ignores all damage that would reduce
her hit points below 0.
Rejuvenation (Su) All nemhains are tied to
a ritual object used in their creation.
This object is typically a large statue,
pillar, or monolith. Until this object
is destroyed, a destroyed nemhain
automatically rejuvenates back to
full hit points 1d4 days after she
is destroyed, always appearing
adjacent to her ritual object.

Description

A nemhain is formed when a soul
deliberately assumes undead status
as a means of protecting a person,
object, place, or ideal. Often, a devoted
priest or ally volunteers herself
and her (often unwitting)
kin for transformation
into a nemhain in order
to continue protecting her
home even beyond her death. The
blasphemous rituals used to create
nemhains are often believed to have
been lost.

While most nemhain aspirants
are evil to begin with'such
individuals are often members of cults
worshiping deities of lost or forbidden secrets-
occasionally a goodly creature considers protecting a
site worthy of a corrupted, tortured existence. Such an
act, however well intentioned, is destined to damn her
for all eternity.
