Description

A massive skull adorns the chest piece of this suit of +1 banded mail, and smaller gilted images of defaced holy symbols cover the other parts of the armor. The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine spells or use any spell-like supernatural ability gained from a connection to a deity. The wearer gains SR 19 against any divine-origin spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (such as a domain granted power or ability from an outsider serving a deity), and treats the armor's enhancement bonus as +2 higher against creatures with these abilities.
