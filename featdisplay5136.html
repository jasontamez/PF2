Your mythic stature makes others uneasy.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay5136.html?ItemName=Intimidating%20Prowess">Intimidating Prowess.</a>

Benefit:  You gain a bonus on Intimidate checks equal to your tier against non-mythic creatures, or half your tier against mythic creatures. If you also have the Persuasive (mythic) feat, you can expend one use of mythic power to treat the Intimidate check as if you had rolled a natural 20. You must decide to use this ability before the roll is made.
