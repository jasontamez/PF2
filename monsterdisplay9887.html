Spore Stalker

This fungoid canine creature skitters forward on many segmented legs, a gurgling growl issuing from its fanged maw.

Special Abilities

Colonize Victim (Ex) As a standard action, a spore stalker can inject spores into the body of a Small or larger living, corporeal, nonplant creature that is pinned or helpless. The victim can resist the spores' infestation with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save. If it fails this save, the victim takes 1d2 points of Constitution drain per round for 6 rounds but can attempt a new DC 19 Fortitude save to end the effect each round, similar to saving against a poison (although this is not a poison effect). Multiple colonizations do not increase the Constitution damage or save DC, but they do increase the duration of the effect by 6 rounds per infestation. A creature that perishes from this Constitution damage splits open, and a fully grown spore stalker crawls from the rapidly decaying remains. This is an <a href="rules58b4.html?Name=Infestations&amp;Category=Afflictions">infestation</a> effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Paralytic Spores (Ex) When a spore stalker is hit by a melee or ranged weapon, it can release a cloud of paralytic spores in a 5-foot radius around itself as an immediate action. Any creature within range when the cloud is released must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d3 rounds. At the start of a creature's turn, it can attempt a new DC 19 Fortitude save as a standard action to end this paralysis effect early. This is a poison effect; the save DC is Constitution-based.

Reactive Escape (Su) Whenever a spore stalker is hit by a melee or ranged weapon, it can teleport up to 30 feet in any direction as an immediate action. This ability otherwise functions as per <a href="spelldisplay0446.html?ItemName=dimension%20door">dimension door</a> (CL 7th).

Description

Capable of spreading and colonizing with disturbing speed, a spore stalker and its kin can quickly overrun an area. Fortunately, a spore stalker's life span is relatively short; a typical spore stalker perishes of natural causes in only a few weeks. Spore stalkers are often used by <a href="monsterdisplay9461.html?ItemName=Mi-Go">mi-go</a> or agents of the Dominion of the Black as biological weapons against unsuspecting citizens of newly discovered planets.
