Description

If you want to perform using a Perform skill associated with a musical instrument (keyboard, percussion, string, or wind), you must have an appropriate musical instrument; otherwise you can't use the skill. The listed cost and weight is for a typical small instrument you could carry by hand, such as a drum, lyre, bell, harp, or flute; larger instruments such as a cello or piano are of course larger and more expensive.

Masterwork Musical Instrument: This high-quality instrument grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks made to perform with the instrument.
