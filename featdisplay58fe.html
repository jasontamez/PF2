You have embraced the Shrouded Lake style of Aldori swordplay, known for its circuitous footwork.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay3e34.html?ItemName=Aldori%20Dueling%20Disciple">Aldori Dueling Disciple</a>, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, base attack bonus +5.

Benefit: When attempting to bull rush or reposition a foe, you gain a +1 insight bonus on the combat maneuver check and a +4 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks of opportunity you provoke. You also gain a +1 insight bonus to your CMD against bull rush and reposition attempts. When you attempt a dueling dodge during a duel, your bonus to AC increases to +6. To gain these benefits, you must be wielding only an Aldori dueling sword (not using a shield, an off-hand weapon, armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).
