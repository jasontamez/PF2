Description

These items appear to be wrist or
arm guards, sometimes etched with
symbols of protection or depictions of
vigilant-looking animals. Bracers of
armor surround the wearer with an
invisible but tangible field of force,
granting him an armor bonus of +1
to +8, just as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers of
armor must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Alternatively, bracers of armor can be enchanted with
armor special abilities. See Table 3-3: Armor Special Abilities
for a list of abilities. Special abilities usually count as
additional bonuses for determining the market value of an
item, but do not improve AC. Bracers of armor cannot have a
modified bonus (armor bonus plus armor special ability bonus
equivalents) higher than +8. Bracers of armor must have at
least a +1 armor bonus to grant an armor special ability.
Bracers of armor cannot have any armor special abilities
that add a flat gp amount to their cost. Bracers of armor and
ordinary armor do not stack. If the wearer receives a larger
armor bonus from another source, the bracers of armor cease
functioning and do not grant their armor bonus or their armor
special abilities. If the bracers of armor grant a larger armor
bonus, the other source of armor ceases functioning.
