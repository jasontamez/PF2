Description

A sacred weapon is filled with divine energy, and acts as a holy symbol. When wielded by a creature that can cast divine spells, the weapon automatically displays an image of that creature's holy symbol, often as a glowing rune on the weapon's blade or along its haft.

Additionally, if the wielder has the blessings class feature, whenever he channels energy, he can choose one ally or ally's weapon within the area of the channeled energy and bestow upon that creature or weapon the benefits of one of his minor blessings at a cost of one use of that blessing.
