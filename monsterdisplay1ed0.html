Description

Tulpas are constructed of ideas and imagination. Beings
of pure thought (some theorize that they are made of
the same mysterious substance as the Astral Plane),
tulpas are made physical by a powerful mind that is
either psychically attuned or has some amount of latent
psychic power.

The exact process that creates a tulpa is not well
understood. Sometimes such beings come about after years
of practice and meditation followed by an occult ritual.
Other times they seem to appear spontaneously, often after
their creators suffer traumatic experiences. More often than
not, in these latter cases, the creators are children. Such a
child witnesses something horrific or far too strange for her
nascent imagination to comprehend, and ends up creating
an imaginary friend to help her sort through the event and
protect her from other potential dangers. While most of
these imaginary friends are nothing more than figments
of her mind, every so often they manifest as tulpas. Some
such tulpas are noble creatures that protect the child who
created them, but just as many are malicious entities that
subtly torment the child or lead her astray.

While a tulpa is a creature of thought created by the
imagination of another being, it has a will and a mind of
its own. This often leads to conf lict between a tulpa and
its creator. In order to protect itself from banishment or
worse, a tulpa often attempts to compel others to think
and concentrate on its existence. This allows the tulpa
to create havens of other "creators" in case its original
creator forgets about the tulpa or becomes incapacitated.
Nonetheless, even a sadistic tulpa or a tulpa with an
actively belligerent creator must protect its creator's life
in order to preserve its own existence.
