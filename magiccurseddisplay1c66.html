Description

This armor is similar in appearance to armor of command and
functions as a suit of +1 full plate. However, when it is worn, the
armor causes the character to take a -4 penalty to Charisma. All
unfriendly creatures within 300 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on
attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or
those affected. In other words, the wearer does not immediately
notice that donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do
foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.
