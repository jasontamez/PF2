Rage Powers - Barbarian









Barbarian Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
As a barbarian gains levels, she learns to use her rage in new ways. Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a rage power. She gains another rage power for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of rage powers only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.



Skald Rage Powers


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide</a>
At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a skald learns a rage power (see pages 32-34 of the Core Rulebook) that affects the skald and any allies under the inf luence of his inspired rage. This cannot be a rage power that requires the creature to spend a standard action or rounds of rage to activate it. For example, the skald cannot choose terrifying howl (which requires a standard action to activate), but can choose knockback (which is made in place of a melee attack).

<td>Animal Fury (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 32</a>): While raging, the barbarian gains a bite attack. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus -5. If the bite hits, it deals 1d4 points of damage (assuming the barbarian is Medium; 1d3 points of damage if Small) plus half the barbarian's Strength modifier. A barbarian can make a bite attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple. This attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the bite attack hits, any grapple checks made by the barbarian against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.</td>

Once per rage, as a swift action that costs 2 rounds of rage, the barbarian can call upon the spirits' favor. Using auspicious mark grants her a +1d6 bonus on one d20 roll she has just made. She can call on the auspicious mark after seeing the result of the d20 roll. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Autumn Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian becomes a servant of the harvest.

In order to do so, the barbarian must confirm a critical hit against an opponent with a natural attack or unarmed strike. The barbarian deals damage as normal for a critical hit and the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's class level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage as one of its vital organs is ripped free from its body. This power can only be used once per rage. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</td>

Larger or smaller creatures used as a bludgeon deal damage based on their size using this base damage. A size Tiny creature deals 1d6 points of damage, a size Medium creature deals 1d10 points of damage, and so on. The barbarian can make a single attack using the pinned opponent as part of the action she uses to maintain the grapple, using her highest attack bonus. Whenever the barbarian hits using the pinned opponent as a weapon, she deals damage to her target normally, and the grappled opponent used as a bludgeon also takes the same damage she dealt to the target. If the pinned opponent is unable to resist being pinned for any reason, the barbarian can use that opponent as an improvised weapon without grappling or pinning the opponent, until the creature is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, at which point the creature becomes useless as an improvised weapon.

</tr><tr></td>Crippling Blow (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 26</a>):  When using her powerful blow rage power, the barbarian can forgo the normal bonus to damage (including any bleed damage granted by the bleeding blow rage power or similar boosts to the damage of the powerful blow rage power) and instead deals 1 point of ability damage to the target's Strength or Dexterity score for every four class levels the barbarian has attained. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) to halve this ability damage.

A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. Note that the barbarian can still use her lesser elemental rage power while using this rage power, but she must select a different energy type.</td>

This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and using this option reduces the maximum distance of the charge by 10 feet.</td>

This attack inflicts 1d8 points of damage for a Medium mount, 2d6 for a Large mount, or 2d8 for a Huge mount, plus 1-1/2 times the mount's Strength modifier. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the mount's Strength modifier) halves this damage. Creatures in the mount's path or that threaten squares it passes through may make attacks of opportunity against either the barbarian or the mount, but not both. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.</td>

This inflicts damage as a <a href="rules57a7.html?Name=Falling%20Objects&amp;Category=Environmental%20Rules">falling object</a> plus the barbarian's Strength bonus. This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material.

This attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If successful, the barbarian sends the target's weapon flying-either straight at the target, or spinning away to strike another foe up to 20 feet away. This ranged attack counts as <a href="rules1d90.html?Name=Weapons&amp;Category=Equipment">throwing a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown</a>, even if the weapon disarmed is a thrown weapon. The barbarian makes a ranged attack, which doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, at either the target of his disarm maneuver or another creature within 20 feet. If the barbarian is aiming for the disarmed creature, the foe doesn't count as being in melee for determining any penalty on the ranged attack from throwing a ranged weapon into melee. If the ranged attack hits, the disarmed weapon deals damage as if the barbarian had thrown it. The barbarian can choose to aim the disarmed weapon at a square rather than at a foe. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</td>

If successful, the target takes damage equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier and is moved back as normal. The barbarian does not need to move with the target if successful.

At 10th level, her bite is also treated as a chaotic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

</tr><tr></td>Powerful Blow (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian gains a +1 bonus on a single damage roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. This power is used as a swift action before the roll to hit is made. This power can only be used once per rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Quick Reflexes (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): While raging, the barbarian can make one additional attack of opportunity per round.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Raging Grappler (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978r?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-River">People of the River pg. 7</a>):  While raging, the barbarian grapples her foes with the power and viciousness of a river crocodile. As long as she is raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a check to start a grapple, she can choose to deal damage as if she had also succeeded at a check to maintain the grapple. In addition, while she is raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple, she can choose to give herself, the target of her grapple, or both the prone condition as a free action while continuing to maintain the grapple.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Reckless Abandon (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can take a -1 penalty to AC to gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls. The AC penalty increases by -1 and the attack roll bonus increases by +1 at 4th level and every four levels thereafter. </td>

<td>Savage Dirty Trick (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy93nc?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Champions-of-Balance">Champions of Balance pg. 23</a>): Once per round while raging, the barbarian can attempt a <a href="rulesbffb.html?Name=Dirty%20Trick&amp;Category=Combat%20Maneuvers">dirty trick combat maneuver</a> in place of a melee attack. This attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If successful, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) or take an additional penalty from the dirty trick based on the type of dirty trick performed and the following table.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Initial Penalty</td><td>Additional Penalty</td></tr> <tr><td>Blinded</td><td>Staggered</td></tr> <tr><td>Dazzled</td><td>Dazed</td></tr> <tr><td>Deafened</td><td>Staggered</td></tr> <tr><td>Entangled</td><td>Anchored in place and unable to move from that square</td></tr> <tr><td>Sickened</td><td>Nauseated</td></tr></table>
On a failed Fortitude save, the opponent takes this additional penalty on top of the dirty trick's original effect. The additional penalty lasts for 1 round (though the initial penalty lasts as long as normal), and can be removed with a move action. The initial effect cannot be removed via mundane means until the additional penalty is removed (though magical effects like <a href="spelldisplayb16b.html?ItemName=remove%20blindness/deafness">remove blindness/deafness</a> work). Removing the initial effect also removes the additional penalty. If the target is immune to the initial penalty, then it is unaffected by the additional penalty.

For example, a barbarian using this rage power attempts a dirty trick combat maneuver against her opponent to blind him. She succeeds and her opponent fails his Fortitude save, so he becomes staggered as well as blinded. Regardless of whether he had succeeded at his saving throw, the opponent still takes an amount of damage from the barbarian's combat maneuver equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier (unless he has damage reduction or would otherwise be able to prevent this damage). Likewise, if her opponent were immune to blinding effects, he would not suffer from the blindness or the staggering effect, regardless of his saving throw.

This power can only be used once per opponent per rage. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Savage Hurl (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): The barbarian gains a +1 bonus on ranged attack rolls with thrown weapons that add her Dexterity bonus to the attack roll. This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level if the barbarian's Strength modifier is at least +4, to +3 at 8th level if her Strength modifier is at least +6, and to +4 at 12th level if her Strength modifier is at least +8.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Savage Jaw (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy991x?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Champions-of-Corruption">Champions of Corruption pg. 27</a>):  While raging, the barbarian can open her jaw wide and latch her teeth firmly onto her opponent. While using the animal fury power, the barbarian can activate this power as a free action and gain the grab ability with her bite attack until the start of her next turn. This power can be used only once per rage. A barbarian must have the animal fury rage power to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Sharpened Accuracy (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  When using her surprise accuracy rage power, the barbarian ignores the miss chance for concealment and treats total concealment as concealment. She also ignores cover penalties except those from total cover. A barbarian must have the surprise accuracy rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Smasher (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 76</a>):  Once per rage, whenever the barbarian makes an attack against an unattended object or a sunder combat maneuver, she can ignore the object's hardness. This ability must be used before the attack roll or sunder check is made. </td>
</tr><tr></td>Spell Sunder (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  Once per rage, the barbarian can attempt to sunder an ongoing spell effect by succeeding at a combat maneuver check. For any effect other than one on a creature, the barbarian must make her combat maneuver check against a CMD of 15 plus the effect's caster level. To sunder an effect on a creature, the barbarian must succeed at a normal sunder combat maneuver against the creature's CMD + 5, ignoring any miss chance caused by a spell or spell-like ability. If successful, the barbarian suppresses the effect for 1 round, or 2 rounds if she exceeded the CMD by 5 to 9. If she exceeds the CMD by 10 or more, the effect is dispelled. A barbarian must have the witch hunter rage power and be at least 6th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Strength Surge (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian adds her barbarian level on one Strength check or combat maneuver check, or to her Combat Maneuver Defense when an opponent attempts a maneuver against her.

</tr><tr></td>Summer Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 36</a>):  The barbarian channels the heat of late summer, making the air around her hot and oppressive. A creature within the barbarian's reach becomes fatigued as long as it remains within the barbarian's reach unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the barbarian's level + her Constitution modifier) to become immune for 24 hours. A barbarian can have only one season-themed rage power, choosing between spring, summer, autumn, or winter rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Sunder Enchantment (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 28</a>):  While raging, whenever the barbarian succeeds at a sunder combat maneuver on a magical item, that item's magical abilities are suppressed for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 points by which her combat maneuver check exceeded the target's CMD. A barbarian must have the spell sunder rage power and be at least 8th level before selecting this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Surprise Accuracy (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 33</a>): The barbarian gains a +1 morale bonus on one attack roll. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the barbarian has attained. This power is used as a swift action before the roll to hit is made. This power can only be used once per rage.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Terrifying Howl (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 34</a>): The barbarian unleashes a terrifying howl as a standard action. All shaken enemies within 30 feet must make a Will save (DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) or be panicked for 1d4+1 rounds. Once an enemy has made a save versus terrifying howl (successful or not), it is immune to this power for 24 hours. A barbarian must have the intimidating glare rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level before selecting this power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Two-Fanged Pounce (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo7?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Villain-Codex">Villain Codex pg. 176</a>): If the barbarian is wielding a pair of daggers, kukris, or punching daggers, she can attack once with each of the two weapons when she charges. If she does, she loses the bonus on attack rolls for charging and takes an additional -2 penalty to her AC, and she applies precision damage or effects that occur on a hit only once, even if she hits with both attacks.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Unexpected Strike (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 34</a>): The barbarian can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the barbarian, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity.

</tr><tr></td>Viper's Breath (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g23?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Dirty-Tactics-Toolbox">Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 9</a>):  While holding a dose of poison in her mouth, the barbarian can exhale a 15-foot cone of inhaled poison. Anyone caught in the spray must succeed at a saving throw against the poison with a DC equal to the poison's DC - 4 or suffer the poison's effects with an immediate onset. A barbarian must have viper's kiss (see below) to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Viper's Kiss (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g23?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Dirty-Tactics-Toolbox">Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 9</a>):  The barbarian can drink 1 dose of an ingested poison as a move action (instead of a standard action) as long as she starts the turn with the poison in her hand. She can hold this dose within her mouth for a number of rounds equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round) without suffering harmful effects. If the barbarian still holds the poison in her mouth after this time, she consumes the poison. While the dose is held within her mouth, the barbarian's next successful bite attack applies the effect of the poison with an immediate onset; this consumes the dose. A barbarian must have a bite attack (at least when raging, such as that granted by animal fury) to select this rage power.</td>
</tr><tr></td>Winter Rage (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 37</a>):  As a standard action, the barbarian can bellow a 20-foot cone of frigid, snowy air.
