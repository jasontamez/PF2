Avian Escape - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay77c6.html?ItemName=Avian%20Escape">Avian Escape</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 43</a>): The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemy's attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as beast shape III). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a raven (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 133). This is a polymorph effect.

This is a masterful trick.
