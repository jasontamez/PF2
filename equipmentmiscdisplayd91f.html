Description

This collection of eight heavy wooden or metal cones, cylinders, and spheres fills an ordinary backpack. None of the shapes is precisely regular, and when stacked atop each other, they teeter precariously and easily topple. Acrobats practice by stacking these blocks in unstable configurations and attempting to balance while standing upon them.

Using surefoot training blocks to improve your balance requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 Acrobatics check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks and on Acrobatics checks to balance on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Climb or Acrobatics check.
