Ritual

Breath of the Grave (Su) As a swift action, spend this boon's effect to breathe a 15-foot cone of rotting stench. Creatures within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + your highest caster level in a class that prepares spells) or be sickened for 1 round. This spends the boon. After this boon has been spent, you take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Stealth checks until you prepare spells again.
