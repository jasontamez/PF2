Cost +1,000 gp Weight +20 lbs.

Description

Plating adds protection to a suit of armor's wearer at the cost of mobility. Double-plated armor's armor bonus is increased by 1, and its maximum Dexterity bonus is reduced by 2.

Drawback

Double-plated armor's armor category (light, medium, or heavy) is considered to be one heavier. Heavy armor that has the modification added to it is too restrictive to use without the Armor Adept (double-plated) feat (see page 11).
