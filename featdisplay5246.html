Your unmatched grace allows you to strike even from the tightest crevices.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb339.html?ItemName=Narrow%20Frame">Narrow Frame</a>, Escape Artist 5 ranks, animal or magical beast.

Benefit:  You can attack from nooks and crannies, even while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space less than half as wide as your normal space, and you do not lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space. You still take a -4 penalty to AC while using Escape Artist in this way.
