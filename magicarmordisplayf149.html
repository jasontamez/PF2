Description

This jet-black helm completely masks the wearer's face above the mouth, giving him a grim aspect. A thanatotic visage has no effect unless worn with thanatotic plate. When the wearer would be reduced to 0 hp or fewer, the visage casts breath of life on her; this does not require an action or even conscious effort. Casting breath of life this way destroys the thanatotic visage.
