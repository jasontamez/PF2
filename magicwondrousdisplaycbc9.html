Description

This sturdy vest stays dry and spotless in the worst of conditions. You can secure up to six objects (weighing up to 1 pound each) to the vest by holding them to it and speaking a command word. You can retrieve any of these items as a move action.

In addition, the vest has four large pockets, each capable of holding as much as 1/2 cubic foot in volume or 5 pounds in weight, and weighing only 1 pound when full. When closed, the pockets are proof against water and the elements. The first pocket contains 1 day's worth of trail rations, a quart of water in a waterskin, two candles, and a tindertwig. The vest recreates these items if the first pocket is left empty for 3 days.
