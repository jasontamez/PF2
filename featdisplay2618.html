You gain an additional wild talent.

Prerequisites: Kineticist level 6th.

Benefit:  You gain a wild talent that's at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wild talent you can currently use. You can select an infusion or a non-infusion wild talent, but not a blast or defense wild talent. If you have the expanded element class feature, you can select a wild talent from any of your elements that's at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wild talent from your primary element that you can currently use.

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Each time, you must choose a different wild talent.
