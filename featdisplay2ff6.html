Your gaze cuts through vapors with ease.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay45f6.html?ItemName=Blind-Fight">Blind-Fight</a>, Perception 5 ranks.

Benefit: You ignore concealment (but not total concealment) caused by fog, rain, smoke, wind, and other gases or weather effects (including magical effects like obscuring mist), and you ignore up to -4 in penalties on Perception checks from such effects. You treat total concealment resulting from any such gas or weather effects within 10 feet of you as concealment (20% miss chance).
