The kata master takes the visual aspect of his martial art to its logical extreme, harnessing her flowing movements and skilled maneuvers as a psychological weapon against her enemies. A kata master forsakes the mental discipline of her more contemplative brethren in favor of these flamboyant exhibitions. She often performs in staged fights and tournaments, utilizing stylized forms to amaze the audience and shock and dismay her opponents.
