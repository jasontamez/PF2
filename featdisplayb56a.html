Numbing Blow - Feats







Numbing Blow (Combat)

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 22</a>
You strike the weapons of your opponents so forcefully that they are unable to quickly recover or counterattack.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Str 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay566d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Disarm">Improved Disarm</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>.

Benefit: Whenever you succeed at a combat maneuver check to disarm an opponent, the opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or be hampered by the pain of the blow. For 1 round, if the target of your disarm combat maneuver failed its save, it can't use the limb or limbs that had been wielding the disarmed weapon to wield a weapon or shield, provide somatic components for spells, or manipulate objects. This is a pain effect.
