Description

This stone is bright blue and dangles
on a silver chain meant to be worn on
the neck. The wearer of this periapt
automatically becomes stable if his
hit points drop below 0 (but not if the
damage is enough to kill the wearer).
The periapt doubles the wearer's normal
rate of healing or allows normal healing of wounds that would
not do so normally. Hit point damage caused by bleeding is
negated for the wearer of the periapt, but he is still susceptible
to damage from bleeding that causes ability damage or drain.
