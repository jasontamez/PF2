Description

This rod functions as a +2 light mace. It takes the form of a light mace with a head in the shape of a clenched fist. While a character wields this rod, it grants all his allies within a 20-footradius burst a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and emotion effects, or a +4 morale bonus on such saves if the ally has the human subtype.

Also, once per day as an immediate action, the wielder can activate the rod to allow himself or a single ally within the rod's aura to reroll a failed saving throw against a spell or effect with the fear or emotion descriptor. The affected creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it is worse.
