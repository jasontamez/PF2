Description

This treated wafer dissolves into a chalky paste when placed under the tongue and then gives the imbiber a jolt of restless energy. It eliminates the effects of fatigue for the next 8 hours; when the drug's effect ends, the user is exhausted. Allnight makes its users jittery and unable to focus; they suffer a -2 penalty on all skill checks until its effects wear off.
