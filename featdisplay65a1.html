You learned to fight in places that have no rules of engagement, such as the back alleys of Absalom or the fighting pits of the Sodden Lands, and you can grab foes in ways that are difficult to escape.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  When you perform a grapple combat maneuver, you gain a +1 bonus on checks to maintain your grapple, and your grappled foes take a -1 penalty on checks to escape your grapple.
