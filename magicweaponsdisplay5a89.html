Description

This wooden pole is plain, save that green dragon scales adorn to its length. Treated as a +2 quarterstaff, it is a favorite of Irori's wandering followers. In the hands of a worshiper of Irori, a quarterstaff of contemplation gains the ki intensifying weapon special ability.

If the wielder is a follower of Irori and possesses the wholeness of body class feature, he can spend a full-round action to meditate using the staff as a focus. Treat this as using wholeness of body at the cost of 1 ki point instead of 2.
