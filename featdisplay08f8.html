Unseat (Combat)

You are skilled at unseating your mounted opponents.

Prerequisites: Str 13, Ride 1 rank, <a href="featdisplay970f.html?ItemName=Mounted%20Combat">Mounted Combat</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, <a href="featdisplay34d3.html?ItemName=Improved%20Bull%20Rush">Improved Bull Rush</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: When charging an opponent while mounted and wielding a lance, resolve the attack as normal. If it hits, you may immediately make a free bull rush attempt in addition to the normal damage. If successful, the target is knocked off his horse and lands prone in a space adjacent to his mount that is directly away from you.

You knock your opponents down from their mounts with frightening concussive force.
