Description

Soothing ripples of warm light crisscrossing along the surface of this amber broth only seem to heighten the welcoming scent of wafting from its steamy depths. This soup enhances the connections between your flesh and spirit, allowing you to briefly return to life if slain. If you die within 1 hour of eating a bowl of newlife soup, you rise on your next turn, alive as if someone had cast raise dead on you, except that you do not lose a level and you have half of your normal hit points. You are alive (not undead) for 10 minutes and can be healed normally but drop dead once those 10 minutes pass. Raise dead or similar spells cannot make your temporary life permanent; to bring you back from the dead, you must be allowed to die when the soup's power ends. Each meal of newlife soup can only bring you back from the dead once.
