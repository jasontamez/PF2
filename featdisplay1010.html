Ascetic Strike (Combat)

Your weapon strikes deal more damage than usual.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc7ce.html?ItemName=Ascetic%20Form">Ascetic Form</a>; <a href="featdisplay0a1d.html?ItemName=Ascetic%20Style">Ascetic Style</a>; Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon; base attack bonus +7 or monk level 7th.

Benefit:  You can use the unarmed strike damage of a monk 4 levels lower than your character level (minimum 1st) instead of the base damage for the chosen weapon. Ascetic Strike functions in all other ways as the brawler's close weapon mastery class feature. In addition, you ignore the still mind class feature prerequisite for the Monastic Legacy feat.
