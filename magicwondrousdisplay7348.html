Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This cap is adorned with seven brightly colored feathers of various types. Each feather imbues the cap's wearer with knowledge of one language; these languages are fixed for each translator's cap.

If the wearer is human, she can give a feather to an ally to allow that ally to use tongues for as long as he carries the feather on his person. Removing the feather removes the language of the wearer's choice from the cap's repertoire. A removed feather works for 1 day before turning to dust, and the cap loses its power when the last feather is gone. The price for the cap includes all seven feathers, and drops by 2,000 gp per missing feather.
