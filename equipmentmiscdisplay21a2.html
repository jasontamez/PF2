Description

This pale salve is always cool to the touch, regardless of the surrounding temperature. When spread on your skin, it subtly alters your aura, making you more difficult for some creatures to detect. For 1 hour after applying the ointment to your skin, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide from any creature attempting to perceive you using <a href="umrca4c.html?ItemName=Lifesense">lifesense</a> or spiritsense (see the <a href="monstersubtypes01d9.html?ItemName=Psychopomp">psychopomp</a> subtype), even if you are clearly in that creature's perceptual field. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
