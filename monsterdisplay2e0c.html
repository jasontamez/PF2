Special Abilities

Calcifying Touch (Su) An incorporeal ozimat's touch can partially petrify a living creature's body, dealing 1d8 points of Dexterity damage. When reduced to 0 Dexterity in this way, an affected creature is petrified for 24 hours. A petrified Medium creature can serve as a stone receptacle for the ozimat's earthen host ability; if used in this manner, it doubles the length of time the ozimat can remain in that form.

Earthen Host (Su) As a full-round action, an ozimat can merge with a body of inert earth or stone, shedding its incorporeality. The form must be roughly the size of a Medium creature. A merged ozimat loses its incorporeal subtype (plus all incorporeal special qualities, including its deflection bonus to AC) and its fly speed, but gains a Strength score of 24, a +8 natural armor bonus (AC 24, touch 16, flat-footed 18), DR 5/-, and Improved Bull Rush and Power Attack as bonus feats. In earthen form, an ozimat gains 2 slam attacks with a +23 bonus to hit, each dealing 3d6+7 points of damage, but cannot use its calcifying touch. Its hit points do not change. An ozimat can maintain its earthen form for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice (typically 16).

Description

Earth elementals are useful for the creation of golems, as their stoic demeanor ensures the longest lasting bond between body and animate force. When a golem is destroyed but the elemental spirit survives, ozimats are the result. Still, those that endure the agony of this experience can ascend to become relatively tranquil beings.
