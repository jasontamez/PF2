Description

This kit consists of hooks, knives, tweezers, and other metal tools, plus various vials of alchemical preservatives, all organized within a sturdy satchel. The tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus on skill checks made to harvest parts or craft trophies and to craft magic items that incorporate such things. Crafted ornaments and parts harvested using taxidermy tools remain potent for twice their usual duration.
