Description

This dart, meant to be thrown using a kestros, consists of a heavy metal point about 9 inches long attached to a shaft of wood about 12 inches long, fletched with feathers for stability. If used as a melee weapon, it is a light improvised weapon (-4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ??2). Kestros darts come in a quiver that holds 10 darts.
