Description

Sometimes, the collective emotional energy of significant or traumatic events creates a lasting psychic impression, even in places not associated with death. These psychic haunts are mind-affecting emotion effects. A character who uses <a href="spelldisplayf363.html?ItemName=analyze%20aura">analyze aura</a> or the <a href="skills5e09.html?ItemName=Perception">read aura skill unlock</a> on a psychic haunt's area automatically detects the haunt and receives cryptic clues about how to put it to rest.

Every psychic haunt focuses on a specific emotion, and when targeted by or within the area of effect of an emotion spell or effect that is not connected to the associated emotion, they take damage equal to three times the effect's spell level (each spell deals damage to the haunt once, regardless of its duration). <a href="spelldisplay071e.html?ItemName=Calm%20emotions">Calm emotions</a> damages psychic haunts regardless of their associated emotion, and an emotion effect without a spell level deals an amount of damage equal to the HD of the creature who created the effect. A character can calm a psychic haunt with a Diplomacy check (DC = 15 + the haunt's CR). If successful, the haunt takes 5 points of damage plus additional damage equal to the amount the character exceeded the DC.

The psychic echo below lies in the heart of an abandoned village. A group of raiders drove the villagers from their home by the sword, but an echo of the villagers' fury persists, stoking hatred against all members of the raiders' ethnic group.
