Description

In addition to granting the same bonus on Perform (dance) checks as regular dancer's garb, silver dancer's garb is considered a silver instrument for silver balladeer bards (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 115). Silver dancer's garb can be made of sunsilver (see below); sunsilver dancer's garb costs an additional 3,000 gp and grants the same benefits as armor made of sunsilver. As with the bonus on Perform (dance) checks, this benefit functions only when no other armor or concealing clothing is worn.
