Description

A dagger is a fighting knife. Its blade is usually less than 1 foot long, and can be curved or straight, with one edge or two. Dagger designs vary widely, and can have many different names (such as a thrusting dagger being called a "dirk"). You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand skill checks made to conceal a dagger on your body.
