You can detect a creature that is using Stealth if you succeed at an opposed Perception check. You can also notice sights, sounds, and other stimuli detectable by your senses. Use the search function of Perception (see below) to find hidden objects, traps, secret doors, and other things that take time to detect.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Stimulus</td><td>Perception DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Hear a battle</td><td>-10</td></tr> <tr><td>Smell rotting garbage</td><td>-10</td></tr> <tr><td>Hear details of a conversation</td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>See a visible creature</td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Smell smoke</td><td>0</td></tr> <tr><td>Determine whether food is spoiled</td><td>5</td></tr> <tr><td>Hear a creature walking</td><td>10</td></tr> <tr><td>Hear details of a whispered conversation</td><td>15</td></tr> <tr><td>Identify powers of a potion by taste</td><td>15 + potion's CL</td></tr> <tr><td>Hear a key being turned in a lock</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>Hear a bow being drawn</td><td>25</td></tr> <tr><td>Sense a burrowing creature underneath you</td><td>25</td></tr> <tr><td>Notice a pickpocket</td><td>Opposed by Finesse</td></tr> <tr><td>Notice a creature using Stealth</td><td>Opposed by Stealth</td></tr> </table>

The DCs of Perception checks to notice (and to search) are modified as indicated in the table below.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Notice Modifiers</td><td>Perception DC Modifier</td></tr> <tr><td>Distance to the source, object, or creature</td><td>+1 per 10 feet</td></tr> <tr><td>Through a closed door</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Through a wall</td><td>+10 per foot of thickness</td></tr> <tr><td>Favorable conditions</td><td>-2</td></tr> <tr><td>Unfavorable conditions</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Terrible conditions</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Creature attempting the check is distracted</td><td>+5</td></tr> <tr><td>Creature attempting the check is asleep</td><td>+10</td></tr> <tr><td>Source, object, or creature is invisible</td><td>+20</td></tr> </table>

Action: None. This function is largely reactive in response to observable stimuli.

Try Again: Yes.

Conditions: Favorable, unfavorable, and terrible conditions depend on the sense being used. Bright light might be a favorable condition if the check involves sight, while dimmer conditions such as torchlight or moonlight could be unfavorable. Background noise could increase the DC for a check involving hearing, and competing odors could increase the DC of a scent-based check. Terrible conditions could include candlelight impeding a sight check, a dragon's roar drowning out other sounds, or an overpowering stench occluding a subtler smell.
