The nation of Rahadoum holds all religions equally in contempt. From calling down the holy fires of Iomedae to saying a quiet prayer on behalf of the dead to Pharasma, any expression of religious worship or spiritual proselytization is a crime punishable by fines, exile, imprisonment-or worse. These anti-religion laws, part of a larger code known as the Laws of Man, were originally created as the solution to the Oath Wars, a decades-long series of holy wars between the faithful of Sarenrae and followers of Nethys and Norgorber that ravaged Rahadoum centuries ago.

The Pure Legion is a government-sponsored military organization created to enforce the Laws of Man within Rahadoum's borders and territorial waters. While the Pure Legion employs many different types of agents, most are simple soldiers who double as city guards. The enforcers, however, are investigators and spies who specialize in ferreting out hidden cults, clandestine relic smugglers, subversive philosophers, and religious terrorists. They might lead squads of rankand- file legionnaires, operate in pairs, or work alone. Though their methods vary, all Pure Legion enforcers are dedicated to keeping their nation free of the gods' shackles by tracking down and purging any divine influence from the Kingdom of Man. Some take on an atheistic fervor that rivals the zealotry of those they seek to keep out of Rahadoum, but most enforcers are simply incredibly skilled at their jobs rather than suffering from any kind of mind-clouding ideology.

The following are class features of the Pure Legion enforcer prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Pure Legion enforcer is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the falchion, scimitar, and shortbow. Pure Legion enforcers are proficient with all light and medium armor and shields (except tower shields).

Aura Sense (Sp): A Pure Legion enforcer can cast detect chaos/evil/good/law at will as a spell-like ability, though he can detect only auras of moderate or higher power. He can detect only one type of aura at any given time.

Nonbeliever (Su): A Pure Legion enforcer gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1) on saving throws against divine spells and spell-like abilities granted by a divine spellcasting class. The enforcer must always attempt a saving throw against the effects of beneficial divine magic.

Divine Detective (Sp): At 2nd level, a Pure Legion enforcer gains the ability to cast detect magic at will as a spell-like ability. He also receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his Pure Legion enforcer level on checks to identify religious paraphernalia, divine spells, or magic items that are divine in nature (such as divine scrolls, aligned weapons, and magic items keyed to specific deities). This bonus also applies to Spellcraft checks to identify the casting of divine spells, Knowledge (religion) checks to identify nonmagical religious items and iconography, and Perception checks to detect hidden or concealed holy symbols.

Voice of Law (Ex): At 2nd level, a Pure Legion enforcer can, as a standard action, attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all worshipers of a specific deity within 30 feet. Spellcasters who are affected by this ability also take a -4 penalty on concentration checks to cast divine spells as long as they are shaken.

Improved Godless Healing (Su): At 3rd level, a Pure Legion enforcer can benefit from the Godless Healing feat one additional time per day, and heals an additional 1d8 points of damage for every 3 levels he possesses, to a maximum of an additional 3d8 points of damage healed at 9th level.

Confiscate (Ex): At 4th level, the Pure Legion enforcer gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm or steal (Advanced Players Guide 322) divine paraphernalia and magic items (such as aligned weapons, divine scrolls, holy or unholy symbols, and items affiliated with a specific deity). He can attempt disarm and steal combat maneuvers against such targets without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Decree of Law (Ex): At 4th level, the Pure Legion enforcer can use his voice of law ability as a move action. Additionally, the enforcer gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures affected by his voice of law ability.

Discern Lies (Sp): At 5th level, a Pure Legion enforcer can discern lies, as per the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to his enforcer level. These rounds don't need to be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.

Disruptive Critical (Su): At 5th level, when a Pure Legion enforcer confirms a critical hit against a divine spellcaster, he temporarily severs the divine conduit between the spellcaster and her deity, preventing her from casting divine spells or using supernatural or spell-like abilities granted by divine spellcasting classes. This effect lasts for 1 round per level or until the spellcaster succeeds at a concentration check (DC = 20 + 1/2 the enforcer's class level + his Charisma modifier).

Edict of Law (Ex): At 6th level, the Pure Legion enforcer can use his voice of law ability as a swift action, and if he is successful, creatures affected are shaken for a minimum of 1 minute instead of 1 round. The duration of this effect is still increased by 1 round for every 5 by which the enforcer exceeds the DC.

Iconoclast (Ex): At 7th level, a Pure Legion enforcer gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver attempts to sunder divine paraphernalia and magic items. He can attempt sunder combat maneuvers against such items without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Absolute Law (Ex): At 8th level, the Pure Legion enforcer's damage bonus against creatures affected by his voice of law ability increases to +4.

Traces of Divinity (Su): At 9th level, a Pure Legion enforcer can detect the lingering effects of magic long after the spell's duration has expired. When using detect magic on a lingering aura from a divine spell or a spell-like ability granted from a divine spellcasting class, the enforcer treats the original aura as one strength level higher than it actually was when determining its duration. If the enforcer exceeds the Spellcraft check to identify the spell by 5 or more, he can sense the same dim aura upon the spell's caster within the extended duration of his detect magic spell.

Iron-Willed Atheist (Su): At 10th level, a Pure Legion enforcer gains spell resistance equal to 11 + his character level against divine spellcasting and spell-like abilities granted by a divine spellcasting class. A Pure Legion enforcer cannot voluntarily lower his spell resistance. Additionally, his damage bonus against creatures affected by his voice of law ability increases to +6.
