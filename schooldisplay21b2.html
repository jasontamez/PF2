The enchanter uses magic to control and manipulate the minds of his victims.

Enchanting Smile (Su): You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess, up to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. At 20th level, whenever you succeed at a saving throw against a spell of the enchantment school, that spell is reflected back at its caster, as per spell turning.

Dazing Touch (Sp): You can cause a living creature to become dazed for 1 round as a melee touch attack. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Aura of Despair (Su): At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of despair for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. Enemies within this aura take a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Associated School: Enchantment.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the enchanting smile and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

Force of Will (Su): You can send thoughts and instructions telepathically to any creature within 60 feet that you have charmed or dominated as though you shared a common language. At 11th level, affected creatures can communicate back to you via the telepathic link as well. At 20th level, any creature that succeeds at a saving throw against an enchantment spell you have just cast is still affected for 1 round if the spell has a duration greater than 1 round.

Irresistible Demand (Sp): At 8th level, you can force others to do your bidding. As a standard action, you attempt to dominate a creature as though using the dominate monster spell, except that the creature must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than your wizard level. The targeted creature receives a Will saving throw each round to negate the effect. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can dominate creatures for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must concentrate as a standard action to maintain control over a dominated creature.

Associated School: Enchantment.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the dazing touch and aura of despair powers of the enchantment school.

Beguiling Touch (Sp): You can charm a living creature by touching it. Creatures with more Hit Dice than your wizard level are unaffected, as are creatures in combat and those with an attitude of hostile toward you. Creatures receive a Will saving throw to negate the effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that fail their save are affected by charm monster for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). This is a mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Shape Emotions (Su): At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura to either ward off or welcome emotional influence for a number of rounds per day equal to your wizard level. If you choose to ward, you and your allies within this aura receive a +4 morale bonus on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects, and any fear effects targeting you or your allies are reduced by one step (shaken has no effect, frightened becomes shaken, and panicked becomes frightened). If you chose to enhance emotional influence, enemies within the aura receive a -2 penalty on saves against mind-affecting spells and effects. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
