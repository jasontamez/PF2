Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The ritual requires the casters to fill a pool with the required water and diamond dust, then restrain a number of Medium humanoid bodies in the pool. The total number of bodies must equal the number of <a href="monsterdisplay89d8.html?ItemName=Sinspawn">sinspawn</a> to be created (two Small humanoids count as one Medium humanoid, and one Large or larger humanoid counts as four Medium ones), and the bodies can have been dead for no more than 8 hours. At least seven casters, which must include the primary caster, stand at equidistant points around the pool to invest the pool with the sinfulness of the gem-bound creature's soul. Upon successful completion of the ritual, the gem dissolves, the bodies melt into slurry, and a number of sinspawn associated with the sin that corresponds most closely with the soul of the creature bound within the gem (envy, greed, gluttony, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath) form out of the churning mass. Sinspawn created in this way are free willed but are initially well disposed toward the primary caster.
