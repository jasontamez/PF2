Your fiendish visage has made you a truly terrifying spectacle to behold, and you can force others to betray their feelings with a single look.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, <a href="featdisplay6d85.html?ItemName=Monstrous%20Mask">Monstrous Mask</a>, tiefling.

Benefit:  Anytime you can make a Sense Motive check to get a hunch or detect whether someone is trustworthy or not, you can choose to instead make an Intimidate check at a -2 penalty. This ability only works on creatures of the humanoid type.
