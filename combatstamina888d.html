You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefit of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. Just before you attempt your free melee attack with Disengaging Shot, you can spend up to 5 stamina points. If you do, increase the attack's damage by 2 points for each stamina point you spent.
