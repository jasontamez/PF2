Claws (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race receive two claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks. The damage is based on the creature's size (Bestiary 302).

Frenzy (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Once per day, whenever a member of this race takes damage, it flies into a frenzy for 1 minute, gaining a +2 racial bonus to Constitution and Strength, but a -2 penalty to AC.

Frightful Gaze (6 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race gain the following supernatural ability: Creatures within 30 feet of a member of this race that meet its gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the 1/2 user's character level + the user's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A target that successfully saves cannot be affected by the user's frightful gaze for 24 hours.

Natural Attack (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Pick one of the following natural attacks: gore, hoof (if the race has hooves), slam, talons, or wings (if the race has flight). Members of this race receive one natural attack of the chosen type. Gore, slam, and talons are primary natural attacks, while hoof and wings are secondary natural attacks. The damage is based on the creature's size (Bestiary 302). Special: This trait can be taken multiple times. Each time, pick a different natural attack.

Reach (1 RP): Prerequisite: Large size; Benefit: Members of this race have a reach of 10 feet.

Swordtrained (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race are trained from birth in swordplay, and as a result are automatically proficient with swordlike weapons (including bastard swords, daggers, elven curve blades, falchions, greatswords, kukris, longswords, punching daggers, rapiers, scimitars, short swords, and two-bladed swords).

Tripping Tail (3 RP): Prerequisite: Slapping tail trait; Benefit: When a member of this race hits with its slapping tail, it can make a trip attack as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
