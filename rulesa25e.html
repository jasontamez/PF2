The following benefits appear in many organizations' stat blocks, and are defined below.

Borrow Resources: Many organizations allow members in good standing to borrow money or items for short periods of time. PCs can borrow money or items worth a total amount listed in parentheses. If the PCs do not repay the loan in a timely manner, they risk losing influence points. Typically, the PCs cannot borrow resources from an organization if they have outstanding debts, and some organizations require collateral. Organizations are more likely to have items that are relevant to their own interests-a mercenary group might loan weapons and armor, but not holy symbols or arcane books, for example.

Command Team: When the PCs reach a high influence rank within an organization, the organization typically allows the PCs to lead a team of its members on a mission. The PCs are expected to protect this team and bring the members back alive. PCs can lead groups of the size and strength listed in each favor's entry.

Gather Information: The PCs can ask several members of the organization to assist them in gathering information about a particular subject, and gain a +4 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy checks to gather such information.

Put in a Good Word: The organization promotes the PCs' reputation among its allies. The PCs gain a number of influence points equal to their rank with the organization with one of the group's allied organizations.

Reciprocal Benefits: The organization leverages its ties to one of its closest allies for the PCs' gain. The PCs can purchase a benefit from the benefits list of a closely allied organization by expending two favors. Treat the PCs' influence rank with the allied organization as 1 lower than their rank with the initial organization.
