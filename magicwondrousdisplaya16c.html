Description

This 4-foot-by-6-foot framed painting is a detailed portrait of
a particular intelligent creature, animated to show movement
or action within the painted scene. The image reacts when
questioned, with the creature turning to face the viewer and
responding appropriately. The image is a magical effect with
no actual intelligence, but is programmed with up to ten 25-
word verbal responses and can respond to questions if these
responses seem appropriate. For example, if one of the
programmed responses is the name of the person shown in the
portrait, it can answer questions such as "who are you"? and
"what is your name"? If the item crafter is familiar with or has
the cooperation of the creature depicted in the painting, the
illusory image has the voice and mannerisms of that creature.
