Description

When this worn leather strap is tied around the grip of a weapon, the weapon becomes immune to the harmful environmental effects of a plane, such as heat or acidity. This does not protect the weapon against non-environmental energy effects; although it would apply to the ambient fire damage caused by being on the Plane of Fire, it would not apply to damage caused by a fireball spell. If the weapon is destroyed, the planar strap is destroyed with it. It is a full-round action to tie or untie a strap. You can only have one planar strap applied to a weapon at a time.
