Description

A spike hilt can be added to any one-handed or two-handed sword or hafted weapon, which conceals a dagger within the larger weapon. An observer who succeeds at a DC 20 Perception check while carefully examining the larger weapon notices the spike hilt. Drawing a dagger from the spike hilt is a swift action. This dagger can be made masterwork or turned into a magic weapon at the normal cost.
