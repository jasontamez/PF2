Description

This ragged, brown robe could be mistaken for a monk's cassock, but the devotees who wear it are dedicated only to the art of killing. This robe grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks and Sleight of Hand checks to conceal a weapon, and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. If worn by a slayer, the resistance bonus on saving throws increases to match the slayer's studied target bonus when he is facing a studied target.

On command, the robe's wearer is able to turn into a brown mist (as the gaseous form spell) for up to 5 minutes per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-minute increments. While the wearer is in this form, the bonus on Stealth checks increases to +10. The wearer can end this effect as a standard action.
