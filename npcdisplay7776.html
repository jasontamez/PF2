Boon A shaman can craft potions for PCs at a 10% discount or make up to three knowledge checks on their behalf. A shaman can also give them a sacred token that grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks with tribes within a 20-mile radius.

Shamans are the keepers of wisdom, myth, and medicine, the watchers over birth, life, and death within primitive tribes. They keep the ancient rites and appease the nature spirits, reading the signs in the smoke and tending the pyres of the honored dead while calling down a burning wrath upon those who would violate the tribe's territory and way of life.

Shamans may tend to good or neutral tribes with long histories and heroic traditions, or might be sinister witch doctors urging depraved cannibal tribes to darker evils. They are usually found in the wilds, but may be encountered in towns or cities, particularly if drawn there by visions or the voices of the spirits.

A shaman may keep a gladiator, monster hunter, or raider as her bodyguard (CR 7), or might have two doomsayers as apprentice shamans (CR 6).
