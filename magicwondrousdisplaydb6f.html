Description

These soft leather sandals have soles that consist of a layer
of purple velvet decorated with intricate gold stitching. When
slipped onto the feet, they feel as weightless as air. In any
round when the wearer has already moved at least 10 feet
along the ground or another surface (not counting travel
on a mount or vehicle), these boots can be activated as a
swift action to give the wearer the ability to walk on air (as
the air walk spell) until the end of the round. If the wearer
hasn't reached a solid surface by the end of the round, she
immediately falls back to the ground, taking any applicable
falling damage. These sandals can be used up to 5 times per
day, but no more often than once per minute.
