Description

When magic scrolls are stored inside this electrum scroll case, glowing blue runes appear on the surface of the tube, indicating what spells are on the scrolls currently stored within. If the user has the spells on her spell list, she can read the runes while holding the scroll case in hand to cast spells from a scroll within the case as though it were in her hand. Casting spells from the scrolls in the case otherwise works as normal, and the scrolls inside the case are depleted as normal. The scroll case holds a maximum of five magic scrolls, and scrolls stored within are protected against fire, water, and other damage.
