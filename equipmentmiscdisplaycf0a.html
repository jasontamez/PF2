Description

This thick leather mat is large enough to fit all the cards necessary for a standard harrow reading. If you use a harrow mat as part of a reading, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff or Diplomacy checks (harrower's choice) to convince the subjects of your harrowing that your words are true.
