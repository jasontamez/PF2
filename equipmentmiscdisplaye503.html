Description

This whip is made from braids of metallic wire. When it is activated, the wielder can expend the power within it to gain a sacred (if activated with positive energy) or profane (if activated with negative energy) bonus on her next disarm or trip combat maneuver with the whip. This bonus is equal to the number of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The whip remains charged until its magic is used or 1 hour has passed.
