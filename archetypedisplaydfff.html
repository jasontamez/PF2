Traceless operatives practice subterfuge and careful preparation in order to accomplish their divine mandates.

Conceal Evidence (Ex): A traceless operative knows how to clean up and obscure the evidence of foul play. It takes her 1d3 ?? 10 minutes to conceal or alter evidence in a 10-foot-by-10-foot area. She uses Disguise to alter evidence or Stealth to conceal it, though bonuses and penalties based on her abilities or effects that disguise or hide her own body (such as from disguise self, a cloak of elvenkind, or the size modifier on Stealth checks) do not apply. A creature attempting to investigate the scene using Perception must succeed at the original Perception DC or a DC equal to the traceless operative's check, whichever is higher, in order to discover the true evidence. A creature who fails against a traceless operative's Disguise check potentially also derives the false evidence planted by the traceless operative.

This ability replaces monster lore and stern gaze.

Trackless (Sp): At 2nd level, a traceless operative's deity helps obscure her path from others. The DC to track the traceless operative (or a group including her) increases by half her inquisitor level. This does not stack with similar abilities, such as a transporter's trailbreaker ability.

This ability replaces track.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level, a traceless operative can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A traceless operative with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her. If the traceless operative already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

This ability replaces bane.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 12th level, a traceless operative can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues (or other classes with the sneak attack ability) the ability to sneak attack the traceless operative by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least 4 more rogue levels (or levels in a class that grants the sneak attack class ability) than the traceless operative has inquisitor levels. If the traceless operative already has improved uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant improved uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum rogue level (or level in another class with the sneak attack ability) required to flank the character.

This ability replaces greater bane.
