The rotting of your flesh has spread to your lungs and fills them with putrid fluids.

Prerequisites: Con 15, <a href="featdisplay2dbb.html?ItemName=Corrupted%20Flesh">Corrupted Flesh</a>, 6 HD, ogre.

Benefit:  You can exhale a 30-foot cone of vile-smelling, moist air mixed with phlegm and remnants of old meals. Creatures in the area must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Constitution modif ier) or they are nauseated for 1d6 minutes. Affected creatures that spend a full-round action gasping for fresh air and scraping off your oral debris may attempt another save to overcome the effect. You can use this breath weapon twice per day, plus one additional time per day for every 6 HD you possess beyond 6.
