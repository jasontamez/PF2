For these mighty grapplers, wrestling normal opponents has lost its challenge-they seek greater targets for glory. Ulfen beast-wrestlers challenge trolls to unarmed combat, and the greatest seek out the great linnorm their lands are known for and wrestle these primeval dragons into submission.

Beast Training (Ex):  At 3rd level, an Ulfen beast-wrestler selects a creature type from the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">Ranger Favored Enemies table</a>. The only humanoid subtype the beast-wrestler can select is giant. She gains a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to her CMD against creatures of the type she selected.

At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, the Ulfen beast-wrestler can select an additional type of creature. In addition, at each such interval the bonuses against any one type of creature she's chosen (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. If a specific creature falls into more than one category, the beast-wrestler's bonuses don't stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher. This ability replaces maneuver training.

Beast Defenses (Ex):  At 4th level, when facing enemies she selected with beast training, the beast-wrestler gains a bonus to AC equal to 1/2 her beast training bonus against that creature. This ability replaces AC bonus.
