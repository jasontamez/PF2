Description

This shining, ash-white ring of bone is crafted to look like countless interlocking rat fangs, set with a dozen dark, garnet eyes like those of albino sewer-hunters. The wearer of this ring can utter a command word to call forth 1d3 rat swarms within 40 feet. These swarms each act immediately and vanish after 7 rounds. They are independent and not under the wearer's control, though the wearer is immune to the effects and attacks of any swarm created through use of this ring.

Alternatively, upon command, the ring's wearer can use dimension door. This magical transportation must begin and end in a square that includes a swarm summoned by use of this ring.

This ring's abilities can be used a total of three times per day, in any combination. An urban druid (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 101) wearing this ring can gain one additional use per day by expending three daily uses of her wild shape ability.
