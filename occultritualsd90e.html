Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The ritual allows the primary caster to inhabit the body of a <a href="monsterdisplayc0c2.html?ItemName=Rune%20Giant">rune giant</a> that she knows firsthand as if using <a href="spelldisplay18c3.html?ItemName=possession">possession</a>. The rune giant must be within 100 miles per character level of the primary caster when the ritual is complete. The rune giant receives no save against this effect. Unlike <a href="spelldisplay18c3.html?ItemName=possession">possession</a>, the primary caster can use all of her own abilities as well as the rune giant's abilities while possessing the rune giant, and the primary caster can choose to use either her own or the rune giant's base attack bonus or base save bonuses. While the primary caster inhabits the rune giant, the rune giant gains 5 bonus hit points per character level of the primary caster.
