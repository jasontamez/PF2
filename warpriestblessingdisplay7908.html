Glorious Presence (minor): At 1st level, you can touch an ally and grant it a glorious blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes mesmerizing to her foes. This functions as sanctuary, except if the ally attacks an opponent, this effect ends with respect to only that opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Demoralizing Glory (major): At 10th level, when you successfully damage an opponent with a melee attack or attack spell, as a swift action you can attempt to demoralize that opponent with the Intimidate skill using your ranks in Intimidate or your warpriest level, whichever is higher.
