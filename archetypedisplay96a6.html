Throughout the Inner Sea region, wave riders patrol harbors, keeping them safe from dangerous sea creatures and watching for smugglers. The most famous of these is the hippocampus-riding Sea Cavalry of Absalom.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  Wave riders are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor, but not with shields. This replaces the cavalier's weapon and armor proficiencies.

Seafaring Companion:  At 1st level, a wave rider gains <a href="featdisplaya697.html?ItemName=Monstrous%20Mount">Monstrous Mount</a> as a bonus feat. The wave rider can use this feat only to select a <a href="druidcompanions8b54.html?ItemName=Hippocampus">hippocampus mount</a>. Otherwise, this ability functions identically to and replaces the cavalier's mount ability.
