Effect The classic "clam clamp" trap utilizes the heavy shell of a giant clam, but any similarly large bivalve mollusk or even flotsam can work. A clam clamp is typically set with a lure, such as a piece of shiny treasure. When a creature walks over a clam clamp or attempts to take the treasure, the clamp snaps shut and attempts a grapple with a +15 bonus on the combat maneuver check. The weight of the clam clamp is enough to hold a creature in place until the grappled creature can escape. A clam clamp located in an underwater area is more difficult to craft but also more dangerous to air-breathing creatures due to the fact that it can hold a creature underwater until it drowns; an underwater clam clamp's CR is 5.
