You can push and pull metal objects using magnetism. This functions as telekinetic maneuvers but you can make only bull rush and drag combat maneuvers, and can do so only against metal objects or creatures. If you use this ability on an attended metal object, you must exceed the creature's CMD as normal, and if it's holding the object, it must drop it or this ability pushes or pulls the creature.
