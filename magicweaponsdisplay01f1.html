Description

This heavy arm of stone appears to have been broken off a statue of a well-muscled female warrior at the shoulder. The arm's wrist serves as a handle, and its fist, clutched around a punching dagger, serves as a pommel. The arm thickens with well-defined musculature all the way to the shoulder. Detailed carvings of tattoos on the stony arm identify the statue as a representation-or perhaps the petrified remains-of a pirate serving under the legendary pirate queen Captain Mastrien Slash.

The pirate's arm functions as a +1 seaborne greatclub. Although it is typically immobile, when the wielder is restrained or grappled, the arm flexes to grant her a +4 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and checks to escape a grapple.
