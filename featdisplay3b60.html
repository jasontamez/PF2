When you change forms, your natural attacks take on not just the physical properties of your weapons, but their magical abilities as well.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay5b4a.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Shift">Weapon Shift</a>, base attack bonus +6, wild shape class feature.

Benefit: When you apply a melee weapon's damage type and properties to your natural attacks using the <a href="featdisplay5b4a.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Shift">Weapon Shift</a> feat, your natural attacks also gain the weapon special abilities of the weapon, such as the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay0b68.html?ItemName=Flaming">flaming</a> special ability. Improved Weapon Shift does not apply the <a href="magicweaponsdisplayca87.html?ItemName=Dancing">dancing</a> special ability or any special abilities limited to thrown or ranged weapons, and it does not apply the weapon's enhancement bonuses to your attacks.
