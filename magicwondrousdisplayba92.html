Description

Runes spiral and skitter across these leather bracers, which are adorned with small spikes. Twice per day, as a swift action after making a successful attack against a creature, the wearer can say the command word to steal all morale bonuses from which the creature is benefiting (this includes morale bonuses on attack rolls, on checks, to AC, or to any other statistics). These bonuses affect the wearer instead of the creature for 9 rounds. After this duration, if the morale bonuses' durations haven't elapsed, the bonuses cease affecting the wearer and resume affecting the original creature as normal. If the wearer attempts to activate this effect against a creature not benefiting from any morale bonuses, a daily use of the item is wasted.
