Description

These fleshy, yellow vines bear leaves that resemble hands. The vines always grow on vertical surfaces when available, creeping up as they mature. A fully mature helping hands vine covers an area 10 feet wide and up to 60 feet tall. Any creature attempting to scale a surface covered by the vines gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. In addition, if the character would fall, the vines grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Reflex saves as the handlike leaves endeavor to catch the character.

A helping hands vine has two 13-week growing seasons in the summer and fall, withering away to nothing once winter hits only to regrow in the summer of the following year.
