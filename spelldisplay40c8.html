Description

You create an illusion that takes the same space as a foe and mimics its movements perfectly. Whenever you cast a spell or throw a weapon, the illusion ceases mimicking the target's actions just long enough to make it look like the target cast the spell or threw the weapon simultaneously with you, such that witnesses who can see both you and the target can't tell with certainty who truly cast the spell or threw the weapon. Witnesses who can see only the target see it as the only apparent source. The subject of this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from these illusory actions. Each target of the attack or spell counts as interacting with the illusion and thus receives a save to disbelieve.

Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components S, F (a tiny marionette)

Effect

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target you and one creature
Duration 1 round/level (D)
Saving Throw Will disbelief; Spell Resistance yes

Description

This spell functions as illusion of treachery except that it also conceals your own actions (as illusion of calm) and renders invisible all spell effects and ranged attacks originating from you until they reach the attack's target (this doesn't cause the attack's target to be unable to avoid the attack, as they still see the attack originating from the spell's target).
