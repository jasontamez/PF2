You are skilled at breaking the defenses of constructs and other creatures.

Prerequisites: Favored enemy (construct) class feature.

Benefit: Your weapon attacks ignore a number of points of damage reduction or hardness equal to half your favored enemy (construct) bonus. This feat allows you to only ignore damage reduction that is normally bypassed by adamantine, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing weapons. Against constructs, the amount of damage reduction and hardness you ignore is equal to your full favored enemy bonus.
