Description

These Medium reptiles are found chiefly in warm climates. Somewhat aggressive, constrictors squeeze their prey to death before consuming it. Due to their size, these snakes are less popular for traveling spellcasters, but they can be quite helpful in a laboratory. More information on constrictor snakes can be found in the Bestiary.
