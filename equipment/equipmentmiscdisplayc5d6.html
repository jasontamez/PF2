Description

This glass container of foul-smelling oil shatters easily upon impact. You can throw a vial of noxious aromatic as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If a creature with the scent sense is standing in the square of impact, it must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds. Any creature with scent in an adjacent square must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. Creatures without the scent ability are not affected by noxious aromatic.
