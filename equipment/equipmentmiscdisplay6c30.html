Terrain any jungles
Preparation A dose of nightsage must be sprinkled with holy water periodically over an 8-hour drying process in natural sunlight; this process requires a successful DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check and one flask of holy water.
Use When dried nightsage is lit on fire (a standard action), it produces a thin but pleasant-smelling smoke almost like that produced by a stick of incense. A dose of nightsage burns for 10 minutes and can be extinguished and reignited for multiple uses (but it is always used in 1 minute increments, regardless of the actual time spent burning).

While nightsage burns, each corporeal undead creature within a 5-foot radius gains a +2 profane bonus on saving throws against positive energy effects (including channel energy effects). Necromancers are fond of supplying their undead minions with small thuribles containing a burning stick of nightsage that can be worn while carrying out their commands. A moderate or stronger wind extinguishes a burning stick of nightsage.

Description

The fragrant purple blossoms of this night-blooming wildflower are so deep in hue that they appear almost black.
