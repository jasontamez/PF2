Description

These two sturdy walking staves are topped with padded cradles that fit under the arm. Aquatic creatures with slow land speeds, such as merfolk or tritons, use land limbs to improve their locomotion while out of the water. Using land limbs increases your base land speed by 15 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet) and requires two free hands. You can remain stationary and balance your weight on land limbs to use your hands normally (such as to draw and hurl a javelin or to open a door), but you cannot move with the land limbs again without freeing your hands.

If your race provides immunity to trip attacks, you lose this immunity while moving with or balancing on land limbs.
