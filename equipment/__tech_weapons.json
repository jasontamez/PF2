			"A monowhip is a deadly melee weapon capable of inflicting horrible wounds, even in the hands of the weak. An inactive monowhip looks like a short metal baton, but when it's activated, a small weight detaches, revealing a 15-foot-long monofilament length. Wielded like a whip, a monowhip slices deeply into targets and can inflict grievous critical hits with shocking ease. Attacks made with a monowhip resolve as touch attacks, and they ignore hardness as if the monofilament were made of adamantine. A monowhip's damage cannot be enhanced by strength, as the monofilament slices with equal ease regardless of the force applied. Activating a monowhip is a move action; once activated, the whip consumes power incredibly quickly, at the rate of 1 charge per round."

The League guards these weapons closely, and when one falls into another's hands, they spare no expense in their efforts to recover it.",
			"A null blade is a +1 construct-bane bastard sword- using it in this capacity does not consume any charges. The blade's strange alloy penetrates hardness as if it were made of adamantine. The blade can be activated as a swift action. While it's active, a shimmering field of green energy wraps around the blade, disrupting magic and technology alike, and the weapon's enhancement bonus increases to +2. In addition, the first time in a round that an activated null blade strikes a creature or object, it consumes an additional charge and targets the creature or object struck with dispel magic and discharge (see page 9). If a technological item damaged by a null blade is used in the same round it took damage, it glitches as if it were timeworn (see page 55)."

A Numerian chainsaw consists of a weighty housing for the engine and power source that is fitted with two handles, and a 2- to 3-foot-long blade extending from the front, around which a whirling, buzzing chain of razorsharp cutting links spins at blinding speed when the weapon is activated. It's a standard action to activate a chainsaw, and doing so consumes a charge of power. The chainsaw continues to run constantly after activation, draining an additional charge each hour. A dropped chainsaw automatically turns off unless it is set down carefully as a move action. The buzzing of a chainsaw's blade is loud and distracting (but not deafening), causing anyone carrying an activated chainsaw to take a -10 penalty on Stealth checks. An activated chainsaw grants a proficient user a +2 morale bonus on Intimidate checks."

Even if the wielder engineers a method of using a larger reserve of nanites than normally come in a canister, this maximum does not increase. Immediately upon being struck, the nanites inflict incredible pain on the target, which must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw to avoid a grisly fate (DC = 10 + twice the number of charges consumed by the attack). For example, if 1 charge is consumed, the target must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist the death ray, but if all 10 charges are consumed in the attack, the DC to resist the effects is 30.",

The victim's gear is unaffected by this attack. A death ray has no effect on creatures that aren't living (such as constructs or undead) and can't penetrate a force field.

While a flare gun has excellent range, the flare tends to wobble and spiral in flight, incurring a 20% miss chance if it's being used to target a specific point. The flare detonates once it hits a target or reaches its maximum range of 2,400 feet, bursting into a sphere of fire that illuminates a 120-foot-radius area for 1 minute as it drifts slowly back to the ground. Any creatures within 20 feet of the flare must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude saving throw each round or be dazzled by the intense light for as long as they remain in the area. Creatures adjacent to a lit flare are also blinded for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. A creature struck by a flare takes 1d8 points of fire damage (1d6 points of fire damage from Small flare guns), and continues to take the same amount of fire damage each round until the flare is removed.

On its pulse setting, it can be used as a typical beam weapon, but on it sustained setting, holding the pistol's trigger down creates a stable beam of gravitons rather than a short, destructive burst. In this mode, the gravity pistol can be used to move and manipulate objects at a distance, similar to a telekinesis spell in its sustained force or combat maneuver versions (a gravity pistol cannot duplicate the violent thrust option of a telekinesis spell). In this mode, a gravity pistol consumes 1 charge per round. The graviton beam can move objects weighing no more than 225 pounds up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on an object in its possession with a successful DC 19 Reflex save. If used to perform a combat maneuver, the beam uses the wielder's CMB, but uses her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength or Dexterity modifier."

			"An inferno pistol is a less refined variant of the longer-range laser pistol. Unlike a laser pistol, which uses an intensely focused beam of light to burn a target, an inferno pistol is much less elegant-it generates a blob of molten, red-hot material and fires what appears to be a burning pellet of fire with a soft hissing sound. This material is consumed swiftly in firing, leaving behind nothing but ash and painful burns on anything it strikes. On a critical hit, a shot from an inferno pistol also inflicts 1 point of burn damage (Reflex DC 12 negates). An inferno pistol has a maximum range of 5 increments."

			"A laser pistol emits a beam of intensely focused light capable of burning anything it strikes. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers-but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage from a laser passing through it. Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment, and though a laser consists of highly focused light, it does not provide any illumination."

			"A mind burner is a pistol with a dishlike adornment at the tip of its barrel. When this weapon is fired, a pulse of white smoke pools in the dish an instant before a thin beam of white light lances out to strike its target. A mind burner is silent when fired, but stray particles from the mind-altering beam can cause those nearby to catch unexpected scents associated with powerful memories-the odor of a bouquet of flowers given to one's first lover, the scent of a parent's perfume or sweat, or maybe even the odor of a favorite food that hasn't been eaten in years. These fragmentary memories generally have no additional effect on those who experience them, but at the GM's discretion, they could cause the resurfacing of repressed memories or forgotten fears.",
			"On a successful hit, a mind burner causes intense headaches that dull the senses and weaken willpower. Each hit deals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage, but also imposes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and a -1 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. These penalties stack with themselves, up to a maximum penalty of -10 on Perception checks and -5 on mind-affecting saving throws. A creature can resist the penalties caused by a shot from a mind burner with a successful DC 14 Will save; otherwise, the penalties persist for 1 hour after the previous successful shot. On a critical hit, a mind burner's penalties are doubled along with its nonlethal damage."

An autograpnel's cord is long enough to allow the grapnel to reach its maximum range of 300 feet, and the internal retraction motors are strong enough to hold up to 500 pounds of weight. If the grapnel misses its target, it can be rewound into the gun as a standard action; reattaching the grapnel to the gun barrel is a move action.",

If it strikes a creature, it remains lodged in the target and connected to the rifle and its wielder by the metal cord. This cord has AC 12, hardness 10, and 20 hp. A successful DC 32 Strength check is required to snap the cord. If the wielder retracts the cord while it's attached to a creature, the autograpnel attempts a pull combat maneuver check with a CMB of +16. If used against objects, an autograpnel can pull an item that weighs 25 pounds or less back to the user as a full-round action, or it can pull a heavier object that weighs no more than 100 pounds back to the user at a speed of 20 feet.",
