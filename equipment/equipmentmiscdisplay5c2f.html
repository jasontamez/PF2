Description

This long, oily, salted fish comes strung on a wick similar to that found in a candle. The fish can be cooked and eaten as a tasty trail ration, with the listed price buying a fish big enough for one day's worth of food for a single creature. As long as the fish stays dry, it can go for months without spoiling. Sections of the candlefish can also be burned as a candle. One day's worth of candlefish is equivalent to six candles. Once used as a candle, a candlefish can no longer be eaten.
