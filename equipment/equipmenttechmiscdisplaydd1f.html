Description

An emergency raft initially looks like a bright red plastic cylinder, 6 inches wide and 2 feet long. When activated, it rapidly inflates into a tough little boat that measures 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. It can hold four Medium creatures. The raft comes with two pairs of collapsible, dense plastic oars to row with. The raft can be commanded to compact back into its portable shape at a touch of a button, as long as no foreign objects or creatures remain inside. An emergency raft only consumes charges when commanded to unfold or compact.
