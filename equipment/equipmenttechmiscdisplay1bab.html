Description

A power receiver is a device that attaches to any technological item's battery slot. The power receiver is then set to the same frequency as a nearby power generator capable of broadcasting power, after which the device draws power from the generator as if it were attached via a power cable. The generator determines the range at which the device can draw power; this signal can be enhanced by a signal booster (see page 51) or blocked by a signal jammer (see page 52).
