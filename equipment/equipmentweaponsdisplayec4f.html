Description

This weapon functions identically to a repeating heavy crossbow, except that its damage, critical, and range values are equivalent to those of a light crossbow instead of a heavy crossbow. Its significantly lighter construction and pull make it both more portable and more useful to those who rely on stealth or speed.
