Description

This scythe has a spring-loaded blade that folds down into the weapon's handle. Opening the scythe blade is a swift action, and closing it again is a standard action. You can use Bluff or Sleight of Hand to treat a closed switchscythe as a hidden weapon; the apparatus can be disguised with 1 minute of work, which grants a +5 bonus on such checks. This disguise is ruined when the weapon is opened and must be reapplied to hide the weapon again. Any effects that apply to a scythe also apply to a switchscythe.
