Description

For all their cowardice and cruelty, goblins have a keen sense of what can kill them, and harpies number among goblins' most feared predators. Using this knowledge to their advantage, Varisian alchemists have devised ways to recreate or distill the musk of harpies into a potent concoction. If smeared on a surface or used as a thrown weapon, harpy musk fills a 30-foot area for 10 minutes before dispersing. Any goblin who enters the area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be shaken for 1 minute. Harpy musk affect only goblins-bugbears and hobgoblins are unaffected. Harpy musk can be created with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
