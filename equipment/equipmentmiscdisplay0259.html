Description

These leather goggles have dark, purple-hued lenses coated with a special alchemical substance that reveals particular psychic spectrums. To provide any benefit, the goggles must be continuously worn for 1 hour, during which time the wearer takes a -2 penalty on all sight-based Perception checks. After this 1-hour period, the user can remove the goggles to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks for the read aura occult skill unlock. This benefit fades after 1 hour.
