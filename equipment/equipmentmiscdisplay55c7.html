Preparation After collecting this rare slime mold from where it naturally occurs in the lightless depths, the herbalist must combine the slime with mineral salts and store it in an airtight container such as a bottle or jar.
Use The slime causes mild skin rashes, but it grants darkvision out to a range of 30 feet for 24 hours if applied to the eyes (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity). If the subject already had darkvision, the darkvision's range increases by 30 feet. Frequent use of this herb causes permanent purple blotches on the skin around the user's eyes.

Description

This violet slime mold is found only in rock formations containing nodules of agate.
