Description

Concocted from samples of elemental earth drained of vitality, this fine powder damages creatures with the earth subtype, as well as constructs made from earth, stone, or precious metals (brass, bronze, copper, gold, mithral, or silver), like holy water damages undead. Deadground dust can also be applied to a stone door to reduce its break DC by 10 (multiple doses don't further lower the DC), and it affects devices and mechanisms made from precious metals or stone like rusting powder does. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
