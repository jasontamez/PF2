Description

This large, coarse blanket covers a single square and has a multi-colored design that blends in with a specific environment type, such as underground, forests, or plains (see the ranger's Favored Terrains table on page 65 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for a full list of environment types). A character covered by a camouflage blanket in that blanket's matching terrain has concealment. Such characters who are also prone gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. The bonus applies even when the covered character attempts a Stealth check to remain hidden after sniping with a projectile weapon.
