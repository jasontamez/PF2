Description

A skillslot is implanted into the
target's brain, leaving a small port
at the base of the skull. This port
is covered with a flap of skin when
not in use. Once installed, a skillslot
has no effect until a skillchip is
inserted into the port (see page 52 for information on the
various forms of available skillchips.) An inserted skillchip
enhances the user's ability in the skill encoded on the chip;
the magnitude to which the skill is enhanced depends on
the power of the skillchip. This does not grant ranks in the
associated skill. It takes 10 minutes for a skillchip to adjust
itself to a new skillslot; during this time, the user takes a
-2 penalty on all skill checks as distracting sensations flood
his mind. When a skillchip is removed, its benefits end
immediately, but the wearer suffers no ill effects.
