Description

This aromatic blend fills the belly with the sensation of fire, warming the drinker's body. By drinking two cups of dragon's blend coffee, you gain cold resistance 5 for 1 hour. Once the coffee has prevented 5 points of cold damage, the effect ends. You can benefit from dragon's blend coffee only once per day.
