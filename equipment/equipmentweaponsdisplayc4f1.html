Description

This weapon fires pellets or a bullet from its trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an effective fowling weapon or closefighting personal defense weapon. The blunderbuss fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A blunderbuss uses a bullet or pellets and a single dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.
