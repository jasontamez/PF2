Description

A quicksilver barometer consists of a slender glass tube, closed at the top, containing an open, mercury-filled base. Many quicksilver barometers are fitted into elegant or even outlandishly ornate housings made of precious materials. Such housings are not necessary for the device to function, and serve only to increase the base price of the tool into the realm of an art object's value. The device interacts with atmospheric pressure, causing the mercury within the glass tube to lower or rise based on external pressure and temperature. It takes 3 rounds for a quicksilver barometer to settle once placed on a flat surface. While this device is normally used to measure and observe local temperature fluctuations (if used in this manner and studied for at least 10 minutes, a quicksilver barometer grants a +4 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to predict the weather), it also functions in a method similar to a haunt detector (see above), but with greater accuracy-a quicksilver barometer grants a +4 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to notice haunts.
