Description

A detonator is a small device that can be used to trigger cranial bombs, cylex, and other explosives remotely. While an explosive is being set, the user can key the explosive to a detonator with a standard action that costs the detonator one charge. Once the explosive is keyed, as a standard action the user can push a button to trigger the explosive. A typical detonator has a range of 1,000 feet- though some may have a reduced range (intentionally or otherwise) and others might be enhanced by a signal booster (see page 51).
