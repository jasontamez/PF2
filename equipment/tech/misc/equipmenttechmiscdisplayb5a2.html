Description

Cylex is an exceptionally stable form of explosive that can be shaped at room temperature, like soft clay. Neon green in color, a single charge of cylex can be triggered to explode by using a detonator (see below) or applying 10 or more points of electricity damage to it in a single action. When detonated, a single use of cylex explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in the area of effect. A successful DC 17 Reflex saving throw halves the damage.
