Description

A tracker chip appears to be a bit of metal the size of a small fingernail. Before a tracker chip activates, it must be implanted in a living creature just under the skin. This procedure takes 1 minute to perform. As part of the installation process, the installer attempts a Heal check, the result of which is the DC of noticing the implant. Once a chip is implanted, its ingenious bioelectric circuits are powered by nerve impulses in the implanted creature's body.

Noticing an implanted tracker chip requires a full-round action to search the target creature and a successful Perception check equal to 10 + the result of the Heal check used to implant the chip. Extracting an installed tracker chip is a standard action that requires a slashing weapon or tool and deals 1 point of damage. Once installed, the tracker chip emits a signal that can be detected by any chipfinder in range. If removed from a body or its host dies, an activated tracked chip retains enough of a charge to continue to be detected by a chipfinder for 1 week.
