Description

This handheld device has a circular screen and several swiveling, dish-shaped objects on flexible stalks that writhe about like short snakes. The device monitors and interprets motion in a 30-foot radius, but must be deployed in a sweeping motion to function-this is a move action that consumes a charge. When used, the device grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Perception checks against moving objects within 30 feet that are size Tiny or larger.
