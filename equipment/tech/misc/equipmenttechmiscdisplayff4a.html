Description

An e-pick (short for "electronic lock pick") is a small device that can be used to unlock and disable electronic locks and devices, much in the same way that a set of thieves' tools can be used to dismantle mechanical locks and devices. Brown e-picks allow a user to make Disable Device checks against electronic devices without penalty; those of higher ratings also grant a competence bonus (as indicated below). See page 5 for more information on how the Disable Device skill works in regards to technology.
