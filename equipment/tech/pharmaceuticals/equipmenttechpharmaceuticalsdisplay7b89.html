Description

A synthetic adrenaline derivative once used by soldiers, hype boosts perception and reaction time but comes with some nasty side effects. This pharmaceutical has an onset time of 1 round and its effects last for 1 hour. It provides a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks and increases the user's base land speed by 10 feet, but the user takes a -4 penalty on concentration checks and on all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skill checks (with the exception of Perception).
