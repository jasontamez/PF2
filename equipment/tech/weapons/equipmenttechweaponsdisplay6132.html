Description

A vortex gun looks like a sleek shotgun with three barrels arranged in a triangular formation. When this weapon is fired, the three barrels release a beam of gravitons that spiral around each other to create a 100-foot-long cone-shaped vortex of devastating energy. This energy tears, crushes, and twists everything in its path. Being struck by a vortex gun induces overwhelming vertigo in living victims. A living creature damaged by a vortex gun must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. A critical hit also allows the user of the gun to attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 15); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Flying creatures struck by a vortex gun are affected as if they were struck by hurricane force winds. A creature protected by a force field takes no damage from a vortex gun but must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save or the shot automatically depletes all of the force field's remaining hit points.
