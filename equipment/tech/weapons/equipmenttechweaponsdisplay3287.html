Description

This Dominion weapon is a 3-foot-long device constructed from a hard, fleshlike material of mottled dark hues. Its barrel tapers down and flares into something disturbingly like a mouth. The triggering mechanism is built for a neh-thalggu's pincers and tendrils, but it can be fired by a humanoid with a bit of work-creatures other than neh-thalggu takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls with a fleshnet cannon. Fleshnet cannons are built for Large creatures, and smaller creatures take additional penalties as appropriate when using these weapons.

When a fleshnet cannon is fired, it makes a low, wet, sucking noise as the barrel seems to convulse an instant before expelling a glob of pink fleshy material. This glob expands rapidly so that by the time it strikes its target, the flesh unfurls into a net. Unlike a typical net, this net doesn't trail ropes, nor does it have a maximum range of 10 feet.

The net automatically entangles a creature of Huge or larger size it hits. As soon as it entangles a creature, and then again at the start of every round that follows for the next 5 rounds, the fleshnet squeezes and crushes the target, dealing 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as it excretes a powerful soporific-the victim must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being rendered unconscious for 2d6 minutes. A fleshnet does not continue to crush a sleeping or unconscious foe.

An entangled creature can escape a fleshnet with a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 10 hit points and DR 10/slashing; it can be burst with a successful DC 28 Strength check (also a full-round action).
