Description

An inferno pistol is a less refined variant of the longer-range laser pistol. Unlike a laser pistol, which uses an intensely focused beam of light to burn a target, an inferno pistol is much less elegant-it generates a blob of molten, red-hot material and fires what appears to be a burning pellet of fire with a soft hissing sound. This material is consumed swiftly in firing, leaving behind nothing but ash and painful burns on anything it strikes. On a critical hit, a shot from an inferno pistol also inflicts 1 point of burn damage (Reflex DC 12 negates). An inferno pistol has a maximum range of 5 increments.
