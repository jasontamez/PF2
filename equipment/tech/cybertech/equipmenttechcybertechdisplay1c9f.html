Description

A cybernetic eye can be enhanced by cyber art for no additional cost, giving it an unusual color or pattern. When a pair of eyes is installed, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against blindness or visual effects. The bonus on Perception checks stacks with circumstance bonuses on Perception checks from other cybernetic sources. A pair of cybernetic eyes can be further enhanced by one veemod (see page 53) at a price equal to twice the veemod's normal price.

The listed price, implantation value, and install DC are for having two eyes installed. A single cybernetic eye costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but a creature must replace all of its eyes to receive the benefits above.
