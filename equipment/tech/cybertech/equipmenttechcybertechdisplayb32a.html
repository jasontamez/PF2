Description

A cybernetic ear can be enhanced by cyberart at no additional cost, giving it an unusual color or shape. When a pair of ears is installed, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Perception checks. This bonus stacks with circumstance bonuses on Perception checks from other cybernetic senses. Cybernetic ears grant a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against sonic effects.

The listed price, implantation value, and install DC are for having both ears installed. A single cybernetic ear costs half the price and half the listed implantation value, but a creature must replace all of its ears to receive the benefits above.
