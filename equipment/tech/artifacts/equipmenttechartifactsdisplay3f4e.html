Description

An autodoc is a large, cumbersome device that consists of a comfortable, plastic-framed reclining chair inside a transparent pod, within which is affixed a dizzying array of multi-jointed arms and extendable devices. An equally dizzying assortment of buttons, lights, and touch-sensitive screens adorn the device, both on the inside and outside of the pod.

An autodoc can heal wounds, set broken bones, cure disease, treat burns, implant cybertech, remove poison, and more. An autodoc can be programmed to perform any number of surgical procedures upon the person lying within the pod-the dozens of arms and devices work with precision and great speed. The operator need only enter in the proper diagnosis or desired operation on the screens at the foot of the bed with a successful Heal check; this requires the Technologist feat to attempt. The DC is based on the operation, detailed below. An autodoc will not activate until it has been properly programmed. Programming an operation takes 2d6 rounds of work. An autodoc has some capacity to error-check and auto-complete the correct programming for an operation before undertaking it by running instantaneous simulations on one of its many screens, granting the user a +5 circumstance bonus on these Heal checks.

An autodoc consumes 1 charge per hour while idle (including time needed to program an operation), and 1 charge per round while operating. As an autodoc can only hold a maximum of 120 charges at a time, for lengthy operations it must be recharged during use or be attached to a standing power supply such as a generator or reactor. While functioning, an autodoc is closed tight-a successful DC 25 Strength check is required to wrench the door open. A patient who leaves or is forcibly removed from an autodoc before an operation finishes (or who is being operated on when the autodoc runs out of charges) must succeed a DC 15 Reflex save or take 3d6+10 points of damage from the cutting lasers, surgical tools, and needles moving at high speed. Needless to say, exiting the autodoc before an operation completes negates any of the benefits that would have been otherwise granted by the device.

The various operations an autodoc can perform are as follows; additional operations can be devised as needed. <ul><li>Minor Surgery (DC 15): The patient heals 1d8+1 points of damage. Operation Time: 1 minute.</li><li>Moderate Surgery (DC 20): The patient heals 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability damage to a selected ability score. Operation Time: 2 minutes.</li><li>Major Surgery (DC 25): The patient heals 3d8+5 points of damage and is cured of blindness and deafness. Operation Time: 3 minutes.</li><li>Critical Surgery (DC 30): The patient heals 4d8+7 points of damage and either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to one ability score. Operation Time: 4 minutes.</li><li>Back from the Brink (DC 35): A dead patient whose body is relatively intact is restored to life at 1 hit point per Hit Die, as if by raise dead (including time restrictions and negative levels). Operation Time: 1 hour.</li><li>Total Molecular Reconstruction (DC 45): As long as at least a small amount of a patient's DNA is available, an autodoc can reconstruct a patient's body completely. At the end of the reconstruction process, the new body is considered to be a blank clone of the patient, and until the patient's memories and personality are implanted into the clone via a neurocam, the body remains alive but inert. Operation Time: 24 hours.</li><li>Install Cybertech (DC = the cybertech install DC): Cybernetic equipment is installed safely. Operation Time: 10 minutes per point of implantation of the cybertech being installed.</li><li>Treat Toxin (DC = 10 + the save DC of disease or poison): The patient has one disease or poison currently afflicting him removed. Operation Time: 10 minutes.</li></ul>
