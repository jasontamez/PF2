Description

While inactive, smart armor resembles a breastplate of adamantine scales, which doesn't seem out of place among the metal armor of Golarion, except for its the alien aesthetics of its Androffan design. When activated as an immediate action, smart armor expands to cover the wearer's legs and limbs, and a built-in magnetic generator hardens the armor into a rigid, plate-like form. When in this form, it uses the statistics of smart armor (expanded form). It can be collapsed back to breastplate form with a move action, and automatically retracts when it loses power. In either form, smart armor provides DR 2/- due to its adamantine construction. Smart armor is considered masterwork armor.
