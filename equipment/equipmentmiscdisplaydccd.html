Description

Almost any preserved food can be found in gnome trail rations, which are designed to keep a wandering gnome from needing to dine on the same meal twice in a week. If you are a gnome who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you are treated as being 1 Hit Die higher for the purposes of spells and supernatural abilities that have variable effects based on Hit Dice, such as color spray and sleep. This does not actually improve your caster level, character level, or Hit Dice in any other way. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day's worth.
