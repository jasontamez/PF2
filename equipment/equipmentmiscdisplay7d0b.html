Description

This malty ale has a legendarily thick, creamy head. It creates a pleasant buzz and sense of euphoria that dull the effects of pain and concussions, granting the drinker a +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws to avoid becoming dazed, staggered, or stunned, or against any effect with the pain descriptor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 138) for 1 hour. In addition, a dose of boulderhead bock grants the drinker 1d6 temporary hit points that apply exclusively against nonlethal damage. Multiple doses of boulderhead bock stack, to a maximum alchemical bonus of +5 and a maximum of 20 temporary hit points.
