Description

More a family of beers than one single drink, dwarven stout is known by different names in human lands. Dwarven stouts are dark beers characterized by a slightly burnt flavor and a foamy head; they are said to be as filling as a meal. Most dwarven clans use a recipe unique to that clan, and family rivalries over the best brew may date back for hundreds of years.
