Description

This suit of armor consists of several layers of scaly mesh over a thick, clothlike polymer weave. When activated, a suit of nanite ablative armor grants the wearer additional protection against nanites, through the use of imperceptible magnetic fields that repel the microscopic robots. An active suit of nanite ablative armor grants its armor bonus (including any enhancement bonuses) to the wearer's touch AC against nanites. The wearer gains a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws made against nanite-related effects delivered through means other than touch attacks.
