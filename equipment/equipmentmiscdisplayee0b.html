Description

This barding is covered in thick metal spikes and is designed to protect the owlbear's chest, shoulders, and neck, while leaving the limbs mostly free for moving and attacking. It provides a +5 bonus to AC, reduces the owlbear's speed to 20 feet, and adds +1d8 piercing damage to its grapple attacks.
