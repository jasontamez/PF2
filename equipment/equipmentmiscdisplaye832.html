Description

This pungent concoction can be thrown as a splash weapon to trigger unsustainable spore or pollen release in fungi and plants. Any plant creature in the square where the spore dehiscent lands must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or immediately activate any of its effects based on spores or pollen, treating itself as the target or center of the effect. Fungal hazards like russet mold or yellow mold are activated automatically with no saving throw. Plant creatures or hazards in squares adjacent to the square of impact must each succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save or suffer the same effect. Once the effect is triggered, the creature or hazard cannot activate the effect again for 1d4 rounds or until the effect could normally be used again, whichever is longer.
