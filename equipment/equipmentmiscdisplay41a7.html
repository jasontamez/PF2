Description

The viscous turquoise oil in this fine glass vial bursts into a pearlescent, silvery mist when exposed to air. You can throw a vial of silvercloud oil as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit allows the mist to enter the body of a target with DR/silver and eat away at the victim's defenses, reducing its DR/ silver by 1 per round for 1d4+1 rounds (to a minimum of 0). Once the duration of this effect ends, the target fully regains its damage reduction. Each creature with DR/silver within 5 feet of the point where the vial struck takes a -1 penalty to its DR/ silver for 1 round. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
