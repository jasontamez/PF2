Description

The most ostentatious and impractical of footwear, the tall heel attached to these boots adds several inches to your height. This type of boot is popular among Chelish nobles, though the trend has recently caught on among some members of Taldan courts. You can use the heel of a stiletto boot as an improvised weapon, dealing damage as a punching dagger
