Description

This dense anchor is attached to a sturdy but easily detachable chain (removing the chain is a move action). Wearing a bottomwalker's anchor all but guarantees an undersea explorer a swiftly sinking buoyancy, though it also increases her armor check penalty by 1 and decreases her maximum Dexterity bonus by 1 (or sets it at +6, if the wearer didn't have a maximum Dexterity bonus). Compared to simply carrying plenty of dense items, it's unwieldy, but the advantage is that the undersea explorer can detach the anchor in a hurry in order to float to the surface, while unloading a number of dense objects might be a slow process (and could deprive the explorer of valuable gear).
