Description

This boot contains a hollow that grants a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal items within the boot while wearing it. The hollow can hold up to 8 cubic inches. Putting on or removing the boot is a standard action, as is retrieving or storing an item from the hollow when the boot is in hand. Adding an item to or removing one from the boot while it is worn is a full-round action.
