Description

This hollow metal cylinder is etched with various religious symbols and contains a reservoir of holy water. When you light its fuse (a move action), a holy fountain firework fills a 10-foot-radius burst with holy water and bright light for as long as it burns. Any creature in the affected area is treated as though it had been struck with a flask of holy water, except a holy fountain firework only deals 1d4 points of damage and does not harm creatures in spaces adjacent to the affected area. Once ignited, the firework lasts for 1 minute.

As a standard action, the firework can be extinguished before this time by being fully submerged or forcing its tip into the ground or a similar surface, but the remaining duration is wasted. A lit holy fountain firework can be picked up and moved, but the fountain's burst of holy water and light doesn't function during this time and the creature carrying the lit firework takes 1d4 points of fire damage each round she holds it. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
