Description

These massive cannons are usually crafted in multiple pieces, and sometimes feature the heads of demons, devils, or other fiends at their mouths. Like normal canons, they propel their projectiles with great force. A fiend's mouth cannon has a misfire range of 1 (30 ft.). Fiend's mouth canons have a hardness of 10 and 140 hit points. Fiend's mouth cannon balls cost 45 gp and weigh 30 pounds each.
