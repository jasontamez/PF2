Description

This close-fitting bodysuit of soft, dark fabric is favored by ninja and assassins. When worn, it grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Wearing armor with a base armor bonus higher than +1 negates this bonus, as does additional heavy clothing or equipment worn under the shinobi shozoku (at the GM's discretion).
