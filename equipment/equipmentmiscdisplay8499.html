Description

Shrapnel caltrops shatter into fragments that embed themselves into a creature's body when stepped on. Shrapnel caltrops work just like normal caltrops, except they are considered masterwork weapons (+1 bonus on attack rolls). Creatures damaged by a shrapnel caltrop must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1d2 points of Dexterity damage in addition to the caltrop's usual damage. The movement penalty inflicted by a shrapnel caltrop cannot be removed until all Dexterity damage dealt by the caltrop is healed, even if the creature receives magical healing or is treated with a successful Heal check. Shrapnel caltrops are destroyed after making one attack rolls. Shrapnel caltrops can't have the hollow special feature or the serrated special feature.
