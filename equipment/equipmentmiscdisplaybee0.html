Description

Carved from heartwood and bearing ornate symbols along its length, this staff is used to reveal critical or uplifting information to other members of the faith, usually during a sermon. When activated, all creatures of the cleric's religion gain a sacred (if positive energy) or profane (if negative energy) bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks for 1 minute; this bonus is equal to the number of dice of the cleric's channel energy ability.
