Description

These wooden braces hook on to a gathlain's wings to help in clinging to ivy, tree limbs, or other surfaces with significant handholds. Many wing hooks are decorated with intricate carvings. A gathlain wearing wing hooks can cling to a surface with a Climb DC of 10 or lower without effort, and can safely sleep there. The wing hooks leave the gathlain's arms free while attempting Climb checks on such surfaces.
