Description

This large weight is attached to a sharp steel hook which
doubles as a carabiner. Once the steel hook is punched
through the skin of a flying creature's wing, the carabiner
locks shut. The weight then acts as an anchor, unbalancing
the creature's wings, which prevents the creature from flying.
The application of wing hobbles causes 1d4 points of piercing
damage, and does not permanently disable the creature
should the hobble be removed. A wing hobble can be
attached to a pinned creature's wing with a successful grapple
check. Removing a wing hobble from a creature's wing is a
full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and
requires the use of two hands.
