Description

This odd weapon is a 2-foot rod topped with four blunt claws. Squeezing the handle causes the claws to close. You can use the gnome pincher to attempt a disarm or steal combat maneuver with a +2 bonus. You can transfer an object from the pincher to your free hand as a free action. Gnomes treat pinchers as martial weapons.
