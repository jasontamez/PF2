Description

This gritty, gray ointment weakens rocky materials. When applied to an object made of stone, it reduces the object's hardness by 3 for 10 minutes. As a standard action, a creature can apply the paste to affect one 5-foot-square or a Medium or smaller creature. The paste only affects hardness, not damage reduction or similar defenses.
