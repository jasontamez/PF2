Vehicles

Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat</a>
In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, low-level characters do most of their traveling on their own two feet. At higher levels, magical travel becomes a common occurrence, as does travel by horseback, atop animal companions, or via more exotic mounts. Every so often, travel may involve a vehicle of some sort-the wagons of a caravan, a windtossed galley, some fantastic form of aerial transport, or even a planes-hopping device. If you like your games with a dose of weird, such vehicles may be as strange as a crashed space vessel. Whatever the case, vehicles in the Pathfinder RPG are often treated as either mobile terrain or adventure sites in their own right.

Many of the iconic motifs that inspire roleplaying games touch on vehicular adventures, from the voyages of Jason and the Argonauts to pirate tales, from charioteers in blood-soaked arenas under a drone of cheers to those who would chase and tame dragons. History and fiction are full of interesting vehicles performing death-defying actions. The rules in this chapter allow you to run combats with vehicles in the Pathfinder RPG, rather than just treating them as objects or terrain.

The following rules attempt to strike a balance between verisimilitude and ease and speed of play during combat. In areas where those two balancing points are conflicted, ease of use should always prevail.<a href="rules7f3d.html?Name=Full%20Vehicle%20Rules&amp;Category=Vehicles">Click here for the full rules on Vehicles.</a>

Description

This thankfully rare and expensive walking monstrosity is one of the more bizarre land vehicles in existence. A giant cauldron of iron atop stubby but effective legs, it hobbles its way across the battlefield at a grinding pace. It costs 100 gp in alchemical reagents to fuel 1 hour of activity. Creatures inside the steam giant gain either total cover (in the lower decks) or improved cover (in the upper viewing and control deck). Only the upper deck has view ports, allowing those inside the steam giant to look out.
