Description

An EMP pistol emits a beam of electromagnetic energy that cannot harm living creatures, but deals terrible damage to robots. An EMP pistol can harm androids and creatures with cybernetic implants, but they take half damage from a hit. A creature that is critically hit by an EMP pistol and takes damage from that hit must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds.
