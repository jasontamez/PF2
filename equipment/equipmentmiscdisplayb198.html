Description

When applied to your hands, this clear, sticky substance made from alchemically prepared pine sap provides a +2 alchemical bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts, on combat maneuver checks to grapple, and on Climb checks; it also functions underwater. Applying the resin is a standard action, and it wears off 1 hour after being applied.
