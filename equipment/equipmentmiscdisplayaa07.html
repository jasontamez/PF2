Description

When you slash this alchemically treated iron spike against your flesh-a move action that deals 1d6 points of damage- the spike extends and becomes a short sword with the ghost touch weapon special ability. The spike reverts to its old form after 10 minutes, corroded and useless. Should a spiritbane spike rematerialize within a corporeal body, it is shunted to the nearest empty space without effect. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
