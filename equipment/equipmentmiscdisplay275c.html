Description

This large leather muzzle is reinforced
with steel chains, and is specifically
shaped for a dragon's snout. The
muzzle is also treated with one type
of elemental proofing (see below)
to prevent it from being destroyed by the dragon's breath
weapon. The muzzle has hardness 10, 40 hp, and a break DC
of 30. A dragon muzzle can be fitted on a dragon using the
rules to tie up a pinned creature. A standard dragon muzzle
can be resized to fit dragons from size Tiny to Large. For larger
versions, the weight increases by a factor of 4 and the price
doubles for each size increase.
