Description

When you scatter this very fine pale blue powder on the ground, it reveals the tracks of any creatures or individuals that have passed through the area within the last 48 hours. The powder also grants you a +10 alchemical bonus on Survival checks to follow tracks or, if you aren't trained in Survival, instead allows you to track creatures whose prints are revealed by the powder for up to 1 mile using Perception instead of Survival. A single application can cover an area of up to 60 square feet. Tracking powder is sold in small leather pouches that hold 10 applications each.
