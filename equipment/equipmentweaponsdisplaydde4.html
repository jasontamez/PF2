Description

These large siege engines are typically wheeled or attached to vehicles that can transport them to the battlefield. This apparatus fires gouts of alchemist's fire in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone (siege crew leader's choice). Targets in the area take 6d6 points of fire damage (DC 15 Reflex save halves); those who fail their saves also catch on fire. A firedrake with the broken condition that suffers a further mishap explodes, dealing its damage to all creatures within a 20-foot blast (DC 15 Reflex save halves). Firedrakes have a hardness of 10 and 70 hit points. One use of firedrake ammunition costs 200 gp and weighs 20 pounds.
