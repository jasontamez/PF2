Consisting of a small wooden frame with inward-pointing barbed spikes, this trap is placed in a shallow pit just deep enough for a Medium-sized character's lower leg. When someone steps in the square, the boot catches and holds her leg. The target takes damage if she tries to move or if a Disable Device attempt to free her fails by 5 or more.
