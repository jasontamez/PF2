Description

Sentient creatures sold to perform a multitude of tasks all fall under the category of slaves. Most slaves are kept to do menial jobs, but sometimes slaves perform specialized tasks such as spellcasting or teaching. Slaves vary in quality; the price may be half as much for old or infirm slaves, or several times more for healthy, attractive specimens.
