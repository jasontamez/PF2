Description

These silver rings are always sold in uniquely crafted pairs' usually one made in a Varisian style and one in an old Korvosan style. Originally made to celebrate the uniting of the Korvosan dissidents and Varisian locals at the city's outset, they are now commonly sought by young lovers, very close friends, and other intimate pairs. When two emotionally intimate creatures each wear one of the rings in a set, both wearers gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This bonus ends if the creatures' emotional bond is severed (at the GM's discretion), one of the creatures removes a ring and returns it to the other creature, or a bonded creature is no longer wearing the ring (or is no longer alive or on the same plane).
