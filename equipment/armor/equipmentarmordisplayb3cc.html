Description

The artistry of a piece of armor's design lies not just in the protection it provides but also in its ability to deflect blows, creating momentary windows of opportunity when an opponent's attack is rebuffed. When an opponent attacks you with a bludgeoning or slashing melee weapon and misses by 5 or fewer, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus on your first melee attack roll against that opponent during your next turn.

Drawback

Deflecting armor reduces your speed by 5 feet.
