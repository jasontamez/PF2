Description

These distinctive suits of armor are a special type of masterwork full plate that grant additional effects when worn by a character with levels in the Hellknight prestige class. Apart from its distinctive look (each order of Hellknights has its own style of armor), a suit of Hellknight plate functions the same as a suit of masterwork full plate.
