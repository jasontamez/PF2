Description

This armor consists of several sections of curved padding held together by an assembly of leather straps. Meant to be worn during martial arts sparring contests, the armor absorbs blows from training weapons and unarmed strikes. The wearer reduces nonlethal damage caused by physical attacks, including natural attacks, by 2 points of damage. The wearer also ignores the first point of lethal bludgeoning damage from natural attacks.
