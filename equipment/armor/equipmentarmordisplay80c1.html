Description

Soldiers in the field and adventurers in the dungeon both find slumbering armor to be a boon, as its layers of downy internal padding allow the wearer to rest comfortably while armored. Slumbering armor is considered to be one category lighter for the purpose of sleeping in the armor. This allows you to sleep in medium armor without penalty, and if you have the Endurance feat (or another method of sleeping in medium armor) you can sleep in heavy slumbering armor without penalty.

Drawback

Slumbering armor's armor check penalty is increased by 1. This increase is applied after reductions for armor material and masterwork armor.
