Description

This set of colorful scarves, is made of heavy silk and reinforced with leather straps. As you move, they flutter and flow, obscuring your shape and protecting against enemy attacks. Varisian dancing scarves provide no benefit while you are standing still. Whenever you move at least 10 feet during your turn, you gain a +2 armor bonus to AC until the beginning of your next turn. Varisian dancing scarves add their enhancement bonus to this armor bonus instead of providing a constant benefit; other magical enhancements (such as light fortification) apply whether or not you are moving. In addition, Varisian dancing scarves provide a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to feint in combat.
