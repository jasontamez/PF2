Description

This large metal canister
releases a cloud of toxic gas. It is usually placed on the
ground and triggered so that the wind blows the gas toward
enemy positions. Normally, multiple gas cylinders are
placed in line and triggered together to cover a wider area
of the battlefield. First, determine what direction the wind
is blowing by rolling 1d4 (1 is north, 2 is east, 3 is south,
and 4 is west). When triggered, a gas cylinder releases a
cloud of mustard gas (see the sidebar on page 67) in a 15-
foot cone. On the following 2 rounds, the cloud extends
by an additional 15-foot square away from the canister,
forming a 15-foot-wide, 45-foot-long cloud at the end of
3 rounds. The cloud moves with the wind, rolling along
the surface of the ground, and disperses after 10 rounds. A
strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and
a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.
