Description

These sturdy leather bracers are studded with lacquered rose thorns that can be used to pierce foes. You can attack with these bracers even while holding objects in your hands. When attacking with thorn bracers, you lose any shield bonus to AC gained from a readied shield until your next action. A thorn bracer can be used to make an offhand attack if you aren't wielding a weapon or shield in that hand.
