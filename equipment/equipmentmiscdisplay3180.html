Description

A blend of finely ground plaster, burning spices, and insect secretions, houndbane dust deters tracking animals. A single pouch can be spread over a 5-foot area as a standard action. For 24 hours thereafter, any creature with the scent ability that enters that square takes 1d2 points of damage and loses its sense of smell for 24 hours. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw take no damage and lose their sense of smell for only 3d6 minutes. Crafting a pouch of houndbane dust requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
