Description

A metal cage behind this arrow's point contains flammable material. You take a -1 penalty on attack rolls when firing incendiary arrows. You can light up to six incendiary arrows as a full-round action (a standard action if you use a tindertwig) that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once lit, the arrow burns for 2 rounds. A lit incendiary arrow deals an additional 1 point of fire damage. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire. Incendiary bolts exist for crossbows.
