Description

This small cauldron of alchemically treated tar gives off thick,
acrid smoke when ignited. The smoke rises to an altitude of
25 feet, then spreads horizontally, creating an artificial smoke
ceiling 5 feet thick. The smoke spreads to a 100-foot radius at
a rate of 20 feet per round. The cauldron smokes for 5 rounds
before burning out. After the cauldron finishes burning, the
smoke lasts for 3 more rounds before dissipating. A moderate
wind (11+ mph) does not affect the heavy smoke, while a
strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 2 rounds.

The smoke is entirely opaque, which means creatures above
the smoke can't see the ground, and those on the ground have
a visual ceiling of 25 feet. Creatures on the other side of the
smoke have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the
attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

Smoke cover is noxious, and any creature that begins its
turn inside the smoke must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude
save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds. Previously sickened
creatures that fail their saves are instead nauseated for 1d6
rounds. Creatures immune to poison are not affected by smoke
cover's sickening effects.
