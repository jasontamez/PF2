Description

This small handheld tool creates a tiny open flame when activated. Once triggered, a lighter's flame (which gives illumination as a candle) continues to burn as long as the lighter's trigger is depressed, consuming energy at the rate of 1 charge per hour. The flame can be used to light larger items on fire, but is not large enough to cause significant damage on its own.
