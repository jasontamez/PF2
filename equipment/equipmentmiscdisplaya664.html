Description

This waterproof and flame-resistant case contains items useful to a spellcaster traveling the Elemental Planes, either intentionally or due to some mishap. The kit includes durable guides to each of the four Elemental Planes, describing a few common creatures and hazards found on each plane and pointing out major landmarks. Each guide grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks and Survival checks for its plane. This kit also contains 3 scrolls of comprehend languages, 2 scrolls of planar adaptation, and a scroll of plane shift attuned to the Material Plane so the kit's owner can return home. The price reflects a kit with divine scrolls; a kit containing arcane scrolls instead costs an additional 2,000 gp
