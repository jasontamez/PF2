Description

This high conical headpiece ends in a tip that usually has a piece of silk or similar diaphanous material dangling from it. Women of noble birth sometimes wear a hennin to formal or social occasions as a signal of their eligibility, and give the silk part of the headpiece as a token to suitors they favor.
