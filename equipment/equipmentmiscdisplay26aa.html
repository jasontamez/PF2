Description

This alchemical substance, originally developed by secretive worshipers of Zon-Kuthon to hide the marks of their devotion, has become popular among former Gray Maidens. When applied to scarred areas of the body, scarsalve causes those scars to fade from view for 1 day. A character who gains benefits from having visible scars loses those benefits while under the effects of scarsalve, but she also gains a +2 alchemical bonus on Disguise checks.
