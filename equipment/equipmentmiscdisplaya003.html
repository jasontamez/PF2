Description

These reed or bamboo whistles mimic the calls of various wild animals. Each whistle is keyed to a specific type of animal and a specific call (usually signaling the availability of food or a mate to draw the animal closer). Using the correct whistle gives you a +2 bonus on Survival checks to track animals of the specific animal type or to get along in the wild.
