Description

This chunk of crystal shines with the colors of the rainbow. A prismatic crystal can be used as a focus for the read aura occult skill unlock to reduce the time needed to read an aura from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. When held by psychic creatures, these crystals also emit light in a small area, increasing the light level in a 10-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). A prismatic crystal can't increase the light level above normal light.
