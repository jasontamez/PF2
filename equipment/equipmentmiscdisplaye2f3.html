Description

The soles of these tough boots include lodestones that have been augmented through alchemical processes to be very strong. While climbing a rope, you can pinch the rope between the boots to prevent yourself from falling; you can release the boots' grip by carefully twisting them apart. The boots also stick to steel, iron, and other magnetizable surfaces.

You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on your Climb checks while using the boots' magnetism to help you climb a rope or magnetic surface. While standing on a magnetic surface, the boots grant you a +4 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and Fortitude saving throws to avoid being blown away by winds. Leaving a square when you the boots are attached to a magnetic surface requires an additional 5 feet of movement, as your overland speed is effectively reduced in exchange for the boots' assistance in climbing.
