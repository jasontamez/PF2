Description

This whistle produces sound at a pitch that can only be heard by aberrations, animals, dragons, fey, and magical beasts. The sound can be detected easily (Perception DC 0) from a quarter-mile away. If the user makes a successful DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, all creatures within 30 feet that can hear the whistle must succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1 round (the -1 penalty applies to hearing-based, rather than sight-based, Perception checks).
