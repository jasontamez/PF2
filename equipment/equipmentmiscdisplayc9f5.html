Description

This is little more than a handle with a cup, loop, or spur to hold the butt of a dart, javelin, or shortspear. Using a spear-thrower to throw such a weapon doubles the projectile's range increment. Setting a weapon into a spear-thrower is a move action; by taking the Rapid Reload (spear-thrower) feat, you reduce this to a free action.
