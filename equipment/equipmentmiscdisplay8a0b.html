Description

This bandolier holds six pouches along its length and a satchel at the hip. Each pouch has a stiff leather flap that can be secured against jostling with a clasp (requiring a move action to open or close) or left unfastened for easier access. The pouches and satchel contain loops and ties for securing additional equipment. The sash buckles at the shoulder, and in an emergency can be freed with a sharp tug as a move action.
