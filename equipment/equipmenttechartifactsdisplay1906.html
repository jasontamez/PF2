Description

A memory facet is a length of crystal about the size of a human thumb. This potent device is used to store programming meant to augment or change the nature of how an AI functions. Originally used as a portable method of safely transporting and storing the complex code required to program artificial intelligences, memory facets can also be used to augment an existing AI. Full rules for memory facets can be found on pages 62-63 of Pathfinder Adventure Path #86: Lords of Rust, including rules for aggression facets, ego facets, and inhibitor facets. The new memory facets detailed below can be found in "Palace of Fallen Stars."

Discipline Facet: This memory facet bolsters an AI's thought and personality with rigid order and behavior, granting it a +2 enhancement bonus to its Intelligence score. In addition, the facet grants the AI the ability to bolster the programming of any robot within 30 feet as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to its CR. A bolstered robot gains a +2 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saving throws. The AI can target an aggregate (Technology Guide 59) under its control with this effect.

Entropy Facet: This memory facet enhances an AI's capacity to understand and interpret chaos theory and probabilities, allowing it to more swiftly react to and mimic emotions. The facet grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the AI's Charisma score. In addition, up to three times per day when the AI rolls a d20, it can roll twice and take either result as an immediate action. This ability must be used after the first roll but before the results are revealed.

Guile Facet: This facet augments the AI's skills at deception and trickery. The facet grants a +4 bonus on Bluff checks. When the AI attempts a Sense Motive check to see through a Bluff, it rolls twice and takes the higher result. Finally, while the AI is controlling a robot, it gains Improved Feint and Greater Improved Feint as bonus feats; it does not need to meet the prerequisites for those feats.
