Description

This small sack of green-gray powder is thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck by a direct hit must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or begin choking and gasping for air as if suffocating (DC 12 for creatures in the splash radius). Affected creatures cannot breathe or speak for 1 round.

Mythic: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a bag of suffocating powder to charge the item with mythic power. Non-mythic creatures do not receive saving throws to avoid the suffocation effect. Affected creatures suffocate for an additional number of rounds equal to your mythic tier.
