Description

This four-wheeled open vehicle is used for transporting heavy loads. It includes the harness needed to pull it. There are three common varieties of wagon.

Light Wagon: Wagons of this type are most commonly employed by farmers and craftsmen transporting their goods short distances or by venders in and around cities. A light wagon carries up to 1,000 pounds of cargo and requires two Medium creatures or one Large creature to pull it.

Medium Wagon: Wagons of this type are typically employed for heavy duty work, often in agricultural, mining, or construction settings. A medium wagon can carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo and requires four Medium or two Large creatures to pull it.

Heavy Wagon: Wagons of this type are large, fourwheeled vehicles primarily used in caravans to transport goods over long stretches of territory. A heavy wagon carries up to 4,000 pounds of cargo, and is pulled by either eight Medium creatures or four Large creatures.
