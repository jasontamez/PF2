Description

These Diminutive rodents are nocturnal fliers that eat insects and fruit. They rely primarily on sound to navigate rather than sight. They can be found all over Golarion and are absent only in desert and arctic regions. Some cultures keep bat houses near towns and villages to control insect problems. Bats from the Uskwood in Nidal are noted for their matte black fur and large size.

More information on bats can be found in the Bestiary.
