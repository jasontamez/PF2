Description

A second-story harness is a series of straps, trusses, and buckles that can be worn over clothing or armor. A second-story harness allows the wearer to, as a move action, secure herself in place on a vertical surface so that both her hands are free. The wearer can remain in this position without needing to make additional Climb checks, and does not lose her Dexterity bonus to AC as long as she remains anchored. As long as the wearer is anchored in this way, she cannot move and gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks made to avoid falling whenever she takes damage. The wearer can release herself to start moving again as a move action. A second-story harness costs 55 gp and weighs 3 pounds.
