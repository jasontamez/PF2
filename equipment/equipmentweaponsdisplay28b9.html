Description

Favored by the Shoanti of the Sklar-Quah, totem spears combine deadly weapons with the mournful music of Varisia's displaced natives. The shovel-like heads of these broad spears are decorated with variously oriented hollows. In addition to its use as a weapon, a totem spear can be played using the Perform (wind instrument) skill.
