Gather DC 30; Yield 1 dose
Terrain anywhere the boundaries between the Material Plane and the Dimension of Dreams grow thin
Preparation The fibrous outer layer of the lichen must be gently scrubbed away, exposing the soft interior, which must then be allowed to dry after being sprinkled with various alchemical powders. This requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check and 8 hours of work.
Use A creature that sleeps for at least 8 hours with a dose of dream lichen in contact with its body has vivid dreams in which it endures and recovers from a supernatural affliction. Upon waking, the creature can attempt a new saving throw against a single curse or mind-affecting effect from which it is currently suffering. Alternatively, the user automatically succeeds at a saving throw to remove a temporary negative level.
