Description

Mythic: If you are a mythic divine spellcaster and burn this incense while preparing spells, you can expend two uses of mythic power to prepare any one spell as a mythic spell (but not as an augmented mythic spell), even if you're normally unable to cast the mythic version of that spell. Incense of divinity burns for 1 hour; you can prepare as many mythic spells as you are able to during this time, but you must expend two uses of mythic power for each mythic spell so prepared.
