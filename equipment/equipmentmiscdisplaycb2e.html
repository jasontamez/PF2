Description

This white paper strip treated with dyes extracted from common lichen is used to quickly test the composition of any water-based solution. The user dips the end of the strip in the liquid and waits 1 round for the chemical reaction to change the color of the strip. If the strip turns purple, then the water contains poisonous toxins and must be purified before consumption. The darker purple the strip turns, the more toxic the substance. If the strip remains white, the solution is poison-free. Though it's not useful for testing oils, slimes, or gases, a strip can be invaluable in determining whether a water source or beverage is tainted.
