Description

This combination of loose-fitting sashes, veils, and ornamentation accentuates a dancer's form and movements. Dancer's garb provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (dance) checks, similar to that provided by masterwork instruments for other Perform skills, but does not grant this benefit when worn with armor or other concealing clothing.
