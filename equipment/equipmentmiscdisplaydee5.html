Description

This large suitcase contains a plethora of items useful to anyone pretending to channel spirits. The case contains candles, mirrors, and 10-foot-long telescoping rods, as well as a selection of specialty items: rigged chalkboards for spirit writing, mundane spirit trumpets for transmitting spirit voices, lengths of gaffed ropes for binding mediums during test seances, and luminous paints and ribbons of fine gauze for fake spectral manifestations.

Using the materials that are included with this kit provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff, Escape Artist, and Sleight of Hand checks to imitate seances, spirit writing, or other occult practices.
