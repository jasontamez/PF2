Description

Found most often in lands heavily modified by magic, this bulbous cactus is topped with twilight-blue flowers. The sap from the cactus can be used as an additive when crafting potions, causing all variable numeric effects of the potion to be determined as if the potion's caster level were 1 higher. When processed into a powder with a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check, Nethys's dagger can be used as an additional material component when casting spells, granting the user a +1 alchemical bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance.
