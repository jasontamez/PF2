Description

This volume, when originally published, contained a trove
of misinformation on dragons, penned by Pathfinder Dalania
Pontius. After these errors precipitated numerous deaths and
countless injuries among Pathfinders confronting dragons
of all types, the Decemvirate investigated Pontius's sources
(namely the brass dragon who had provided her with much
of the false info) and found them suspect. The volume was
eventually corrected, though some unaltered copies could still
remain in obscure collections.
