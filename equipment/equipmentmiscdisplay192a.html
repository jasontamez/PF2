Description

This alchemical concoction can be spread over a Medium or Small creature's body as a full-round action. It provides a +5 alchemical bonus on Escape Artist checks, grapple checks to avoid a grapple, and Reflex saves to avoid an ooze's improved grab or engulf abilities, but gives a -5 penalty to disarm checks, grapple checks to start or maintain a grapple or pin, and other checks that may be hindered by a loose grip (such as Climb). One application lasts for up to 1 hour and can be removed with soap and water.
