Description

An incredibly useful kit for convincing cultists and evildoers of all kinds to divulge their nefarious plots, interrogation tools appear intentionally gruesome. Various pliers, knives, hooks, shears, and mind-weakening drugs are strapped to the interior of this beaten leather bag. More often than not, the very presence of interrogation tools is enough to induce a prisoner to talk. Unfortunately, these tools also inspire some very convincing lies. Interrogation tools grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks made while questioning prisoners, but they impose a -1 penalty on Sense Motive checks made to determine whether the information gleaned is accurate or not.
