Description

Non-halflings do not receive any bonus from this drink. According to legend, the inventor of this dark and harsh liquor actually did attack a dragon bare handed (and presumably lived to pass on the recipe). Halflings who drink four cups of Dragon Punch Whiskey in the space of an hour take a -4 penalty to Dexterity but gain a +4 alchemical bonus on saves against fear for the next 10 minutes.
