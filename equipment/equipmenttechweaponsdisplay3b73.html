Description

A potent fusion of magic, advanced science, and masterful weaponsmithing, null blades were devised by the Technic League as weapons against both magic and machine. Null blades incorporate an adamantine-noqual alloy in their blades, a closely guarded metallurgical secret of the Technic League. The League guards these weapons closely, and when one falls into another's hands, they spare no expense in their efforts to recover it.

A null blade is a +1 construct-bane bastard sword- using it in this capacity does not consume any charges. The blade's strange alloy penetrates hardness as if it were made of adamantine. The blade can be activated as a swift action. While it's active, a shimmering field of green energy wraps around the blade, disrupting magic and technology alike, and the weapon's enhancement bonus increases to +2. In addition, the first time in a round that an activated null blade strikes a creature or object, it consumes an additional charge and targets the creature or object struck with dispel magic and discharge (see page 9). If a technological item damaged by a null blade is used in the same round it took damage, it glitches as if it were timeworn (see page 55).
