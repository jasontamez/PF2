Description

The powdered salts in this stoppered glass sphere contains reagents blessed by a cleric or another divine authority. You can throw a sphere of consecrated salts as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Consecrated salts deal damage to evil outsiders, haunts, and undead as if they were a flask of <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay0315.html?ItemName=Holy%20water">holy water</a>. Additionally, if a haunt or rejuvenating undead such as a <a href="monsterdisplaya37e.html?ItemName=Ghost">ghost</a> is reduced to 0 hp within 1 minute of being damaged by consecrated salts, its reset time (in the case of a haunt) or rejuvenation is delayed by 1 day. This delay can also be achieved by sprinkling consecrated salts on the earthly remains of a ghost or the affected area of a haunt. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check.
