Description

When launched from a ballista, this specialized bolt unfurls into a large net. An attack with entangling ammunition is a ranged touch attack, but it's only effective within one range increment. If it hits, the target is entangled, but the attack deals no damage.

An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a successful DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action). Entangling ammunition is useful only against creatures within one size category of the firing ballista.
