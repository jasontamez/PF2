Description

This large, portable spool of rope or cord contains a clockwork mechanism to reel the rope back in. You can unspool the rope from the mechanism at a rate of 30 feet per round. Activating the mechanism as a move action causes the rope to retract at a rate of 100 feet per round, pulling up to 200 pounds of attached weight. The mechanism works more slowly with increased weight, retracting the rope at a rate of 50 feet per round with more than 200 pounds but up to 300 pounds of attached weight. Weight in excess of 300 pounds prevents the mechanism from functioning. A rope recaller is sold with 100 feet of hemp rope already attached, but can hold up to 1,000 feet of rope. Replacing or adding rope to the device requires 1 minute of work for every 100 feet of rope.
