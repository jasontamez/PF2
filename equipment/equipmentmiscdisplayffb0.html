Description

This portable hookah can be worn as a backpack, obviating the need to set the hookah down before filling it with water. Up to four creatures (including the wearer and any adjacent creatures) can use a traveler's hookah during the same round. While wearing a traveler's hookah, you can stopper the hookah's bowl valve as an immediate action to prevent unwanted individuals from using it until the valve is reopened as a free action. If you are knocked unconscious or otherwise fall prone while wearing a traveler's hookah, you must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or the hookah is smashed during the fall. A traveler's hookah can hold up to 5 doses of a single substance, and has four hoses.
