Description

This hard, ceramic canister is filled with a noxious mass of diseased carrion and offal that can be used as ammunition for a catapult or a trebuchet. It deals only half damage, but every creature hit by it is exposed to filth fever (Core Rulebook 557). A GM might allow a plague bundle to inflict other diseases.
