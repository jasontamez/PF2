Description

This brass timepiece can be wound with a small key, causing it to count down until it reaches the end of its duration, at which point it emits a small chime. Most dials have a maximum duration of 60 minutes, with each turn of a key adding 10 minutes, though some are crafted with longer or shorter durations and intervals.
