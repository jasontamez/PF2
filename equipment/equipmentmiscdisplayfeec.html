Description

This whip has small caltrops or metal barbs woven into its length and a quartet of metal whistles attached to the fall; when snapped, the whistle sounds like screaming owlbear young. An owlbear's rider uses this noise to enrage the monster, prodding it to attack the nearest creature. Anyone who attacks an owlbear with such a whip draws its attack in preference to all other targets.
