Description

This pitch-black liquid slows your heart rate, putting you in an almost trance-like state. For 1 hour after drinking this tincture, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on Stealth checks, you can use Stealth while moving at full speed without penalty, and the DCs for Intimidate checks to demoralize you is 2 higher. The tincture's sedative nature causes you to take a -4 penalty on Strength-based skill checks and a -2 penalty on damage rolls for the same duration.
