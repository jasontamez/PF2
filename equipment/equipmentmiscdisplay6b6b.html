Description

This alchemically infused wax is spread over exposed skin to protect it from chapping, cold, dry winds, heat, and the loss of moisture. Applying it takes 5 minutes; once applied, it reduces any nonlethal damage taken from cold or hot environments by 1 point for 6 hours. Crafting blain bane requires a successful DC 19 Craft (alchemy) check.
