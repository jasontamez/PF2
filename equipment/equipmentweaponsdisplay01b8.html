Description

This pistol has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be fired independently as separate attacks, or both can be fired at once as a standard action (the attack action).. If both barrels are shot at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the pistol becomes wildly inaccurate, imposing a -4 penalty on each shot. This is an early firearm.
