Description

These strange books are fashioned from a metallic alloy,  the crafting of which is known only to yithians and a very  few others. Supposedly taken from the same collection as  the fabled Pnakotic Manuscripts and traded throughout the  multiverse, these books are collections of notes recorded  by visitors to the yithians' cities. Each book is written in  multiple languages and provides a vast array of information  on a specifc topic, but the information it contains is often  oddly specifc and lacks context. A single Pnakotic record  focuses on a single subject within the confnes of a single  Knowledge skill, such as a presentation on the nature of deep  one religious practices in worshiping Cthulhu (Knowledge  [religion]), the mechanics of a shoggoth's biology  (Knowledge [dungeoneering]), or the methods of creating  portals between worlds (Knowledge [arcana]). By studying  a Pnakotic record for 8 hours, a reader can attempt a  single Knowledge check of the appropriate type when  researching the book's corresponding subject to gain  a +10 circumstance bonus on the check.
