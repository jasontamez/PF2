Description

This form-fitting garment is strung all around with dozens of small bells. You can practice your sneaking technique by donning a belled catsuit and then attempting to move without letting any of the bells ring. Old thieves sometimes call a belled catsuit a Billy-Jacket. Training with a belled catsuit requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 25 Stealth check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to hide. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Stealth check.
