Description

Troll styptic is used as a field treatment for wounds and bleeding, particularly where magical healing is not available. When applied directly to wounds, this jar of paste grants a living creature fast healing 2 for 2d4 rounds. While active, the styptic also closes any open wounds the subject receives, negating any bleed effects that would affect the target. This is a painful cure, and the target must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for the styptic's duration.
