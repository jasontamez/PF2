Description

Meant for quick strikes and slashes, this long, slender knife is incredibly sharp along one edge. Drow swashbucklers and assassins are particularly fond of these weapons. A confirmed critical hit or successful sneak attack with a drow razor deals an additional 2 points of damage; this damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A character with the drow's weapon familiarity racial trait treats the drow razor as a martial weapon.
