Description

Fine plates of articulated steel reinforce these elbow-length leather gloves, which are designed to allow animal handlers and animal hunters alike to confront beasts with natural defenses like spines and quills. While wearing the gloves, you gain DR 2/magic against attacks of opportunity provoked when you attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple a creature. You also gain this damage reduction and a +1 circumstance bonus on Reflex saves against defensive abilities that deal damage when you strike a creature with a nonreach weapon, unarmed strike, or natural attack. The thick gloves restrict your movement, imposing a -2 penalty on precision-based skill checks that involve your hands (such as using Disable Device to pick a lock)
