Description

When ingested, this thin serum awakens your potential for independent action. If you are under the influence of a mindaffecting effect, you receive a new saving throw with a +4 alchemical bonus to break the effect (you can gain this benefit only once per day). If the serum is ingested by a bonded creature such as a familiar, animal companion, bonded mount, or homunculus, the creature ceases to be bound to its master's will for 10 minutes. It gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks, and becomes interested in finding its own way of doing things. Its attitude toward its master might change drastically during this time, depending on how the master has treated it in the past. As soon as the duration of this effect ends, the creature becomes bound to its master's will again.
