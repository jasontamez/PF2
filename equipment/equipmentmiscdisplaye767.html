Description

These cloaks are popular among traveling bards, and each patchwork cloak is unique. The patches represent where the traveler has been, and often the performer uses them to recall specific stories from his repertoire. When a bard retires or dies, he often bequeaths his cloak to a young entertainer he mentored or admired.
