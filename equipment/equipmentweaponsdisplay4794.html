Description

This curved, scooped-shaped, 2-foot-long wicker basket attaches to your wrist, allowing you to throw fist-sized stones at great speed merely by whipping your arm forward. Loading a sling glove is a free action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity so long as you have a free hand. You take -4 penalty when throwing a stone at an adjacent target and cannot use the weapon to attack creatures in your space.
