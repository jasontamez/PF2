Description

A tactically adapted weapon is designed for specialized tactics rather than just swinging and stabbing. Only melee weapons can be tactically adapted. When this quality is added to a weapon, choose a weapon quality from the following list: blocking, brace, disarm, distracting, nonlethal, performance, or trip. The modified weapon gains that weapon quality.
