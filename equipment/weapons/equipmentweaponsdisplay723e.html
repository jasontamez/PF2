Description

Also known as an iron claw, this device consists of a fanlike structure of three or more 10-inch blades secured to a sturdy handle strapped to the forearm of the off hand. It can be used as an offensive weapon or defensively like a buckler, or used to disarm an opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. It provides its owner with a +2 circumstance bonus on attempts to disarm or sunder swords or other slender-bladed weapons.
