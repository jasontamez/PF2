Description

This larger version of a tanglefoot bag entangles its target as normal and requires a successful DC 20 Reflex saving throw to avoid being stuck to the floor. In addition, it can affect Huge and smaller creatures, and has a range increment of 60 feet. A creature that is glued to the floor can break free by succeeding at a DC 30 Strength check or by dealing 25 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon.
