Description

A weapon with the versatile design modification is easier to wield for those skilled with other weapon groups. When versatile design is added to a weapon, choose a fighter weapon group. The modified weapon is considered to be a weapon of that weapon group (such as for the fighter's weapon training class feature). A melee weapon cannot be considered part of a weapon group for ranged weapons, and vice versa.
