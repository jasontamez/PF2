Description

Patterned after the fiery blades masterfully wielded by Sarenite angels, the split-blade sword is both a holy symbol and a difficult-yet-effective weapon. A split-blade sword resembles a large scimitar whose blade splits into two about two-thirds of the way toward the tip. If your Dexterity score is less than 15, you take a -2 penalty on attacks rolls with a split-blade sword, as you're unable to maneuver its unusual blade.
