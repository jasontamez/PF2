Description

This ballista bolt is specially equipped with a net which unfurls as the bolt flies toward its target. Unlike a standard ballista bolt, a ballista net requires only a touch attack to hit. If a ballista net hits, it deals no damage, but causes the target to become entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run.
