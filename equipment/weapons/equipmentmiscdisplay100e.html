Description

This flask of volatile chemicals contains traces of graveyard dirt and a few drops of blood from a righteous creature. You can throw a bone burn flask as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Against non-undead creatures, a bone burn flask functions as a normal flask of acid. Against undead creatures, the bone burn flask deals double damage. On the round following a direct hit, a skeletal undead damaged by a bone burn flask takes 1d6 additional points of damage (Reflex DC 15 negates). Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
