Description

Note: Originally known as "Desnan Candle Firework".

When lit, this footlong wooden tube launches a flaming pyrotechnic "candle" every round for 4 rounds. The projectiles deal 1 point of nonlethal damage and 1 point of fire damage if they hit; on a critical hit, the target is also blinded for 1 round. The projectiles shed light as candles for 1 round and have a range increment of 5 feet. Attacking with a star candle is a ranged touch attack and always has a -4 nonproficiency penalty. Crafting this item is a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
