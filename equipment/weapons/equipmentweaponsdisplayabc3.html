Description

A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from chains at opposite ends of a long haft. This weapon excels at short but powerful strikes, and is typically swung in a constant churning motion. The wielder of a dire flail must have great strength, both to use the weapon effectively and to keep from tiring out.
