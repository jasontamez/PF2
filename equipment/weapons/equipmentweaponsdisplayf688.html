Description

This improvement on the musket features a grooved barrel that imparts a twisting, spiral motion to the bullet as it exits, stabilizing it and preventing the end-over-end tumbling common to projectiles from simpler firearms. As a result, a rifle can fire significantly farther and with more accuracy than early long-bore firearms.

A rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.
