Description

An alchemical cartridge is a prepared bundle of black powder with a bullet or pellets, sometimes with more exotic material added, which is then wrapped in paper or cloth and sealed with beeswax, lard, or tallow. There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge-a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.

Dragon's Breath Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment">Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</a>) This cartridge contains alchemical compounds that, when fired, produce a cone of fire instead of the normal attack of a one-handed or two-handed firearm with the scatter weapon quality. The nonmagical flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all targets within the cone of the scatter firearm (DC 15 Reflex save for half). These cartridges cannot be used in firearms that don't have the scatter weapon quality. Because this ammunition forces a saving throw instead of making an attack roll, the misfire rules are slightly different. If you roll a 1 with either of the damage dice, the firearm misfires.

Entangling Shot Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment">Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</a>) This mix of black powder and an alchemically treated resin strong enough to survive the shot can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or another scatter weapon. It deals half damage to those hit by a cone attack made with this weapon, but any creature hit by the shot must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or become entangled for 2d4 rounds. An entangling shot cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2.

Flare Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment">Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</a>) When a flare cartridge hits its target, it deals only half the normal damage, but the creature struck is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 reduces this to dazzled), and creatures within a 20-foot burst are dazzled for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates the effect). Flare cartridges are also useful for sending up signal flares. Firing a flare cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2 unless it is fired from a blunderbuss or a dragon pistol, in which case doing so only increases the firearm's misfire value by 1. Flares can be used only to attack single creatures; they do not work as a shot for a scatter weapon's cone attack.

Gray Dust Cartridge: (Source  <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 18</a>) Packed with mysterious magic-suppressing dust from the Mana Wastes, these rounds burst on impact and inhibit spellcasting. When a gray dust cartridge strikes a target, it deals only half damage, but the creature struck takes a -10 penalty on concentration checks to cast spells for 1d4 rounds and cannot cast defensively.

Gray Dust Shot Cartridge: (Source  <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 18</a>) This version of the gray dust cartridge can be loaded only into a weapon with the scatter quality. It functions similarly to a gray dust cartridge, except upon impact it bursts into a 20-foot-radius cloud. Creatures within the cloud take a -5 penalty on concentration checks to cast spells. This cloud dissipates in 1d6 rounds in still air. Light wind disperses the cloud in 1 round.

Molten Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sk7?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-Wastes">People of the Wastes pg. 15</a>) This cartridge holds a handful of alchemically infused pellets that ignite and become molten when fired as a scattering shot with a one-handed or two-handed firearm with the scatter weapon quality. These molten projectiles deal fire damage to targets hit by the scattering shot, and each target hit must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or take 1d6 additional points of fire damage each round as the projectiles smolder. An affected target can use a full-round action to scrape off the smoldering projectile before taking this additional damage. In addition, molten metal fragments litter the area, functioning as caltrops in each square of the scattering shot cone (except they deal fire damage). These projectiles and fragments cool down after 3 rounds, at which point they become harmless bits of metal. Firing this cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2, and the cartridge can be used only in early or advanced firearms with the scatter weapon quality.

Paper Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment">Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</a>) This simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet increases the misfire value by 1.

Repellent Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sk7?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-Wastes">People of the Wastes pg. 15</a>) This cartridge can be used only in early or advanced firearms with the scatter weapon quality. To use a repellent cartridge, make a scattering shot against an AC of 5. If you succeed, you create a cone of foul fumes that lasts for 2 rounds, after which the stench becomes inert and dissipates. Any creature within this area when the fumes are created or any creature that enters the fumes while they are active must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d6 rounds. Being affected by the fumes multiple times lengthens the duration of the sickened condition. If your attack results in a misfire that causes your firearm to explode, the area of the cloud is instead centered on one corner of your square (your choice), with a radius equal to the firearm's misfire burst size. Firing this cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 1.

Salt Shot Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tmc?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Equipment">Ultimate Equipment pg. 41</a>) This mix of black powder and rock salt can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other scatter weapon. It deals nonlethal instead of lethal damage, and increases the misfire value by 1. You can use it only with a scatter weapon's cone attack.

Smoke Cartridge: (Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 18</a>) This cartridge can be loaded only into a weapon with the scatter quality. Upon striking a target, it deals no damage, but instead bursts into a cloud of smoke in a 20-foot radius. This smoke impairs sight beyond 5 feet; any creature farther away gains concealment (20% miss chance). The cloud disperses after 1d4 rounds, or in 1 round in light wind.

Toxic Cartridge: (Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9sk7?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-People-of-the-Wastes">People of the Wastes pg. 15</a>) A toxic cartridge can be used only in early or advanced firearms with the scatter weapon quality. To use a toxic cartridge, make a scattering shot against an AC of 5. If you succeed, you create a cone of burning toxic gas that lasts for 1 rounds, after which the gas dissipates. Any creature within this area when it is created or any creature that enters the gas while it is active must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d2 rounds. Being affected by the gas multiple times lengthens the duration of the sickened condition. In addition, any creature that begins its turn in the area takes 1d6 points of fire damage. If your attack results in a misfire that causes your firearm to explode, the area of the cloud is instead centered on one corner of your square (your choice), with a radius equal to the firearm's misfire burst size. Firing this cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 1.
