Description

A gnome hooked hammer is a double weapon-an ingenious tool with a hammer head at one end of its haft and a long, curved pick at the other. The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (critical multiplier ??3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (critical multiplier ??4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.
