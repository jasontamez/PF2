Description

This congealed incendiary functions like alchemist's fire, but its white-hot flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage on a direct hit and 1d6 points of splash damage to adjacent creatures.

Mythic: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a flask of Artokus's fire to cause the substance to burn hotter and longer than normal. A creature struck by a direct hit of Artokus's fire must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or continue to take 1d4 points of fire damage each round at the beginning of its turn. A burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the user's mythic tier, and otherwise acts as the burn universal monster rule (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 298). Artokus's fire used in this way burns even underwater, offering no relief to creatures that try to extinguish the fire by dousing or immersing themselves in water.
