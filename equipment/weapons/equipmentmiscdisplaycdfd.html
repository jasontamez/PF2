Description

This large flask holds a swarm of angry wasps. A portable hive can be thrown as a splash weapon, and when it hits a grid intersection or a creature, a <a href="monsterdisplay2d74.html?ItemName=Wasp%20Swarm">wasp swarm</a> appears in a 10-foot-by-10-foot square at the point of impact. This swarm does not have the distraction or poison special abilities, and it disperses after 1d4 rounds. Crafting a portable hive requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check
