Description

This flat, metal weapon consists of two joined crescent-shaped blades overlapping to form a hollow center with four projecting points. The blades can differ in length. One side of the center is wrapped to serve as a grip while the other acts as a guard. Deer horn knives are traditionally used in pairs.
