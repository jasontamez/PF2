Description

Specially crafted from solid darkwood, heartstake bolts are specifically designed to slay vampires. A heartstake bolt can be fired from any crossbow, but it imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll and halves the range increment of the weapon. A vampire struck with a heartstake bolt takes the normal damage but must also succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or fall to the ground helpless for 1 round. While the vampire is helpless in this manner, a creature can attempt to use the heartstake bolt to finish off the vampire by driving it through the vampire's heart as a full-round action. Once the debilitating effect of the heartstake bolt has ended, the vampire can pull out the bolt as a move action. A vampire slain with a heartstake bolt is subject to the rules and limitations of slaying a vampire with a wooden stake as described under vampire weaknesses .

A heartstake bolt deals normal damage for the crossbow of its type.
