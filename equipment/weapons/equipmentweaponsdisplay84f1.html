Description

These slightly curved swords measure just over 3 feet in length. An Aldori dueling sword can be used as a martial weapon (in which case it functions as a longsword), but if you have the feat Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword), you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an Aldori dueling sword sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can also wield an Aldori dueling sword in two hands to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage rolls.
