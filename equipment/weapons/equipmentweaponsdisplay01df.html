Description

This weapon acts as a kumade, but the handle consists of bamboo sections held together by a taut rope running through the center. Releasing the rope is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity and causes the weapon to collapse into a bundle that fits into a backpack. Reassembling the collapsible kumade requires a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
