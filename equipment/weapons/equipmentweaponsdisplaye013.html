Description

An alchemically fired piston in the head of this two-handed hammer strikes targets with astounding force. Successful sunder attacks made with a piston maul deal an additional 4 points of damage. A piston maul requires a thunderstone to function; otherwise, it functions as a greatclub. Inserting a thunderstone into the weapon's compartment is a standard action, and powers the weapon for 24 hours, after which the thunderstone is consumed.
