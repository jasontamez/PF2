Description

Incendiary catalyst can be thrown at a creature as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. On a hit, the target is doused with accelerants that give the target vulnerability to fire (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 305) for 1 round. Incendiary catalyst does not affect creatures that are already vulnerable to fire, and the target's fire immunity and resistances apply as normal. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
