Description

The weapon's edge is honed to incredible sharpness. The weapon's edge dulls after a number of daily uses, but the bonus can be reset by spending 15 minutes whetting the blade after a night's rest. Only piercing or slashing weapons can have the razor-sharp modification. Projectile weapons can't be razorsharp, but their ammunition can. A razor-sharp weapon gains a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls for a number of attacks each day equal to 3 + your base attack bonus.
