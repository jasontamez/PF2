Description

This short lash has a reach of only 10 feet, but is otherwise identical to a normal whip. The wielder gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal checks to push a trained animal and on Intimidate checks made to demoralize any animal as long as the animal is within the whip's reach. When using the whip to demoralize a trained animal, the wielder may choose to fascinate the animal rather than causing it to become shaken for the same duration as the shaken condition, but the fascinate effect ends if line of sight between the wielder and the animal is broken.
