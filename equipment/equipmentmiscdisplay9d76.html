Description

This array of thick, heavily lined pads, including a quilted helmet, rigid shin guards, and a wraparound rib guard, protects you during hand-to-hand training. Sparring gear cannot be worn with armor, but grants DR 2/- against nonlethal damage. Fighting schools often customize their sparring gear to feature prestigious colors or symbols.
