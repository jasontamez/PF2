Description

One side of this foot-square metal box is covered with tiny hoses that undulate slightly, as if testing the air. A short spigot protrudes from the opposite side. The other four sides of the box are covered with panels that flash and hum in a repeating pattern. This device operates as a nutrient dispenser. Once per day, when any panel is pushed as a full-round action, the node extrudes a dollop of nutrient paste from the spigot. This paste contains sufficient nutrients to sustain a single Medium or smaller creature for one day. For 24 hours after use, the tiny hoses take in trace amounts of air, dirt, or any other nearby substances and the node processes the matter into more nutrient paste.

The default nutrient paste is foul-tasting. However, if the panels are pushed in a fashion that matches the repeating pattern flashing on the box (Intelligence DC 10), the node introduces nanites that render the paste delicious. On subsequent days, the flashing pattern becomes more complex-the Intelligence check's DC increases by 2 after each success. When an Intelligence check is failed, the machine produces foul-tasting paste and the Intelligence DC resets to 10 on the following day. A creature that eats delicious paste from the same node for 6 consecutive days benefits from an accumulation of intellect-enhancing nanites and receives a permanent +1 inherent bonus to Intelligence. The same creature can benefit from a nutrient training node in this manner only once; further paste has no effect.

Nodes that train other abilities, such as those that train Strength, are also rumored to exist.
