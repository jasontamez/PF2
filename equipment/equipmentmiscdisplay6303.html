Description

This ashen powder can be thrown as a splash weapon, muffling all sound within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact. Perception checks to notice sound emanating from or passing through the cloud take a -10 penalty. Alternatively, applying a dose of silence dust to your feet as a standard action grants you a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks to avoid being heard while walking. The dust is effective for 1 minute before it disperses.
