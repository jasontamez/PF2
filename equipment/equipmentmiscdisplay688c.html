Description

This enzyme is derived from a parasitic fungus that breaks down most organic tissue, and is especially destructive to plants and other fungi. A flask of lyddric essence can be used like a flask of acid, dealing normal acid damage to creatures not of the plant type. However, plant creatures, plants, and fungi targeted with lyddric essence take 2d6 points of acid damage on a direct hit, or 2 points of acid splash damage if within 5 feet of where it hits.
