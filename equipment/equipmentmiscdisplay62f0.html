Description

When imbibed, this effervescent solution causes a heavy warmth to spread from your stomach outward to your limbs, resulting in feelings of security and well-being. If you sleep for at least 1 hour after consuming the solution, the next time within the next 24 hours that you attempt a saving throw to remove a temporary negative level, you can roll the save twice and use the better result. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
