Description

This tool lets you dig a pit at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. If a shovel is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.

Folding Shovel: A folding shovel is a full-sized shovel with a sturdy sectional handle that folds into pieces no longer than the shovel blade, allowing it to fit in a smaller space such as a backpack. Converting the shovel from its folded state to usable (or vice versa) is 2 full-round actions.
