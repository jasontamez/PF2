Description

This training contraption consists of a stout, 7-foot-tall wooden pillar with spring-powered woodand- brass arms jutting sideways at different heights. When the springs are wound, the arms wave erratically through the area within 10 feet of the pillar. The arms don't swing with sufficient force to cause damage, but you can practice your acrobatic technique by moving up to and around the pillar while the arms are in motion, attempting to avoid being tagged. The mechanism operates for 10 minutes before winding down. The entire contraption can be dismantled and stowed in a chest the size of a large foot locker for transport.

Using the pillar to hone your acrobatic techniques requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 20 Acrobatics check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity provoked by moving out of or through an opponent's threatened area. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail an Acrobatics check.
