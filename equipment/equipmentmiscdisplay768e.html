Description

Constructed to resist the effects of hot environments (such as forest fires and areas of volcanic activity), this set of overlapping, heavy leather clothing includes a pair of fire-resistant boots. The outfit grants fire resistance 1, but exposure to fire damage ruins the outfit after 20 rounds.
