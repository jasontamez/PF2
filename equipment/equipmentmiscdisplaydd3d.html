Description

This highly viscous liquid resembles tree sap and is difficult to swallow. For 2 hours after drinking this tincture, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus to your CMD and you can perform combat maneuvers as if you were one size category larger. Your skeleton's increased density causes you to be treated as if you were carrying a medium load, or a heavy load if you were already encumbered by a medium load, for the same duration.
