Description

A flying blade is a large, crescent-shaped blade anchored to a 10-foot chain. You fight with a flying blade by spinning it about your head or by snapping it toward an opponent. Because the flying blade is a clumsy weapon, you receive a -2 penalty on attack rolls with it, but when you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls instead of the penalty.
