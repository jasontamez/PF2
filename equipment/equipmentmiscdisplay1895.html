Description

Once exposed to air, this greenish alchemical sludge quickly takes on a faint glow. This glow provides dim illumination in the area immediately surrounding the fist-sized lump of false ectoplasm. This glow-in-the-dark effect lasts for 1 hour before the substance begins to decompose into a brownish goo. A successful DC 20 Sleight of Hand check allows a user to open a vial of false ectoplasm and deposit it on an adjacent surface as a move action; a successful opposed Perception check is enough to notice this trickery.
