Description

Used in siege warfare, these blinders restrict the owlbear's vision to directly where its head is pointing, helping to stop the owlbear from getting distracted and allowing the rider to focus its attention. This gives the rider a +2 equipment bonus to Ride checks made to control the owlbear, but gives the owlbear a -2 penalty to Spot checks.
