Description

This staff has a cradle at the end, designed to hold alchemical weapons such as acid. A flask thrower significantly extends the range of thrown substances that deal splash damage, such as acid, alchemist's fire, or holy water, as well as that of tools such as tanglefoot bags, thunderstones, or caltrops.
