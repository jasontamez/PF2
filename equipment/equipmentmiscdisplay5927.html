Description

This dry powder can be mixed with water to produce skim milk. It is dried by slowly adding millet flour to milk while heating it, cooking it down until it becomes thick, then allowing it to dry. Powdered milk is sold in sealed pots or jars. One pound makes approximately 1 gallon of milk.
