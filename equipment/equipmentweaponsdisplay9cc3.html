Description

This elaborate knife is carved with special barbs and grooves, meant to channel toxins into the bloodstream. Any injury poison delivered with a sanpkhang has its DC increased by 1, or by 2 if delivered as part of a critical hit or sneak attack. The vishkanya's weapon familiarity racial trait grants proficiency with the sanpkhang.
