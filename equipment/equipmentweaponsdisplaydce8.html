Description

This massive ballista fires a dozen or more bolts at once in a devastating rain of steel that deals 3d8 points of damage. The crew leader makes a separate attack roll with a -2 penalty against each creature and object within a 60-foot cone, ignoring concealment. Confirm any critical threats separately. This weapon has a mishap only if the first attack roll is a mishap. A manticore's tail has a hardness of 5 and 100 hit points. Ammunition for one use of the manticore's tail costs 120 gp and weighs 120 pounds.
