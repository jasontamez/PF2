Description

This alchemical flare explodes in black sparks 1 round after lighting. Any creature with darkvision in the same square as a darkflare when it explodes must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or lose its darkvision for 1d10 rounds. Affected creatures can still use other vision (such as normal vision and low-light vision) with no penalty.
