Description

This illustrated piece of paper typically measures 24 inches wide and 32 inches long. An artist's poster is typically used as an advertisement that can be easily seen by crowds of people. Placing a poster within a settlement grants creatures a +1 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information regarding the subject of the poster. If the settlement's population is greater than 1,000 people, one additional poster must be placed for every additional 1,000 people (or portion thereof) to gain the bonus. The cost of this item includes commissioning an artist of appropriate talent to complete the poster, and copies of the poster beyond the first cost 5 sp each.
