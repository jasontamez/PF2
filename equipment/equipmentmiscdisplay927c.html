Description

This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for a flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires bright light, such as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and at least a fullround action. A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed.
