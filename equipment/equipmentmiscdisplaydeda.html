Description

Although Anulites make great use of foreign spices, Anulite paprika is perhaps the most popular in the city, especially among the wealthy. This bright red seasoning is used in all manner of seafood and vegetable dishes, imparting the heat greatly treasured in Anulite cuisine. Consuming a meal seasoned with Anulite paprika grants you some resistance against flames, reducing the amount of damage taken each round when you have caught on fire by 1. This benefit lasts for 8 hours and does not stack with itself.

The price and weight listed represent a jar containing enough paprika to season 10 meals.
