Description

Favored by rogues in statuesque Magnimar, these adornments hide tiny secret compartments. False jewelry grants a +8 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to hide a tiny object on your person (does not stack with the bonus for hiding very small objects) and negates the +4 bonuses searchers receive when frisking you. False jewelry costs 20 gp in addition to the value of the ornament being fitted with the secret compartment.
