Description

For some unknown reason, this finely crafted but mundane monkey statue repulses oni. Any creature with the oni subtype (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 307) that is within 30 feet of a monkey statue takes a -1 penalty on all d20 rolls. The monkey statue can be unattended or presented by its wielder as a swift action to cause this effect; the statue has no effect on oni if it is simply stored on a wielder's person. A wielder must have a free hand available to present the statue and gain its effect. This penalty does not stack with that from other monkey statues.
