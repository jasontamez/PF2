Description

This kit contains three pliable suction cups, a constrictor strap, a tiny razor, and several vials of snake antivenom. When suffering a poison that was delivered by the bite attack of a snake (or other ophidian creature, such as a serpentfolk), as a full-round action, you can use this kit to gain a +4 circumstance bonus on the ongoing Fortitude saving throws against that poison. A snakebite kit is exhausted after 10 uses.
