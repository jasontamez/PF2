Description

This tiny jellyfish has a crown roughly 4 inches in diameter, and it glows with bioluminescence as brightly as a candle, typically in a blue or green color, but various species allow an array of possible colors (though generally this commands greater prices). When trapped in a container with small holes to allow in the plankton the creature eats, these creatures can serve as living lanterns, especially for creatures with lowlight vision. In some places, like Talasantri, they drift freely as mobile light sources. A luminous jellyfish lives up to 1 year in this stage of its life cycle before dying.
