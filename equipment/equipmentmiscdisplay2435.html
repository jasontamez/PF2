Gather DC 18; Yield 1 dose
Terrain any forests or mountains
Preparation The petals of a dragon rose must be delicately removed from the stem and then soaked in a mixture brewed from the flower stalk's sap for 2 hours; this requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.
Use A dose of prepared dragon rose petals crushed in the hand and then smeared on a weapon (this is a standard action) infuses the weapon with a magic aura. For 1 hour, the weapon can bypass DR/magic, although it doesn't gain any bonus on attack or damage rolls.

Description

The vivid and thorny dragon rose is admired for its hardiness but is difficult to cultivate.
