Description

Heavy blades typically used by guardians of religious sites, temple swords have distinctive crescentshaped blades, which appear to be an amalgam of sickle and sword. Many have holes drilled into the blade or the pommel so that charms, bells, or other holy trinkets can be attached to reflect the owner's devotion or to serve as foci for prayer or meditation. Monks are proficient with the temple sword.
