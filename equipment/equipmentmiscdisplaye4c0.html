Description

Darklands explorers who frequently run afoul of troglodytes, pockets of natural gas, and toxic fumes from magma flows use this dense flask to ease their breathing. You can open the flask as a standard action or throw it as a splash weapon. When opened or broken, the flask releases a burst of cleansing, breathable air in a 10-foot-radius burst, providing a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws against gases, inhaled poisons, or other breathable hazards. The cloud of fresh air lasts for 1d4 rounds. If you hit a creature that has the stench ability with a thrown flask of deep breath, the DC of its stench is reduced by 4 for the duration of the cloud.
