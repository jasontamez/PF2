Description

Anointing a creature's eyes with a dose of fury drops causes it to immediately fly into a rage for 1d6 rounds, granting it a +2 alchemical bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 alchemical bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical to a barbarian's rage, and creatures are fatigued at the end of the rage. Only creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 can be affected by fury drops.
