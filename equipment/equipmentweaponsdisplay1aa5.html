Description

These carefully crafted wooden bolts have a hollow core filled with alchemist's fire. On a successful hit, they deal normal damage plus 1d4 points of fire damage. Alchemical fire bolts do not cause any splash damage, and the fire burst isn't enough to ignite targets (unless they are particularly flammable).
