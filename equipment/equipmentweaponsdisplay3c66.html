Description

This specialized bolas can be used to perform ranged trip combat maneuvers against creatures far larger than the wielder. It consists of a pair of metal weights connected by a silk rope 20 feet long. Because of the great size and weight of the bolas, you need both hands to swing it around your head, and considerable time to get the weights up to speed. Making a ranged attack with it is a full-round action. You can use a dire bolas to trip a creature whose size is up to three size categories larger than yours.
