Description

Swallowing this dark black-red tea pill causes your blood to heat up, granting you a +2 alchemical bonus on initiative checks and on saving throws against cold effects for 8 hours. However, any damage you take from bleed effects during this time is multiplied by 1-1/2 (rounded up). Swallowing a blood-chilling pill while under the effects of a blood-boiling pill negates the effects of both pills.
