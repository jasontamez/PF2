Description

Standard M1914
grenades can be fitted with an optional fragmentation
sleeve. This sleeve converts the normal concussive
blasts into a cloud of deadly shrapnel at the expense of
a decreased damage radius. The device is armed and
detonated in the same manner as a regular M1914 grenade,
though the explosion radius is reduced to a 15-foot radius
and the grenade instead deals 4d6 bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage (Ref lex DC 15 for half ).
