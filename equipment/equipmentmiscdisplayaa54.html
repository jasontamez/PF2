Description

Whether bent, colored, or scratched, marked cards allow an informed user to know what's on the front of the card by viewing the mark on the back. Realizing that the cards are marked requires a DC 25 Perception check or DC 20 Profession (gambler) check. The listed price is for a common paper deck.
