Description

This spiraled metal rod has alchemically treated bristles that can be used in the barrel of an early or advanced firearm to liquefy grime and bullet fouling while leaving a thin protective film in the bore. Using this brush is a standard action, and the protective film grants a 5-foot alchemical bonus to the firearm's first range increment and a +1 alchemical bonus on attack rolls. These effects last for 1 hour or until the firearm is fired. A newly crafted bore brush contains 5 applications. Crafting a bore brush requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.
