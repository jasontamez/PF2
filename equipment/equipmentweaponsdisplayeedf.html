Description

One end of this short rope has a sling bullet wrapped in a monkey's fist knot, and the other end is tied in a small loop. You wrap the loop around your wrist as a full-round action and swing the weighted end like a flail. If the loop is properly attached to your wrist and you drop the rope-shot or are disarmed, you can recover it as a swift action. Removing the weapon's loop is a full-round action. You get a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a rope-shot on your body. Halflings treat rope-shots as martial weapons.
