Description

Saddles are used to support a rider or supplies on a mount.

Military Saddle: This saddle braces the rider, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks related to staying in the saddle. If the rider is knocked unconscious while in a military saddle, he has a 75% chance to stay in the saddle.

Pack Saddle: A pack saddle holds gear and supplies, but not a rider. It holds as much gear as the mount can carry.

Riding Saddle: These saddles are the most pervasive type of riding equipment. If the rider is knocked unconscious while in a riding saddle, he has a 50% chance to stay in the saddle.

Exotic Saddle: These saddles are designed for a variety of unusual mounts, each customized for a specific type of beast. Exotic saddles come in military, pack, and riding styles, just as normal saddles do, and have the same traits.
