Description

This lumpy, lardlike, alchemical substance is designed to protect armor and weapons from dents and cracks that commonly develop in close-combat equipment. When liberally applied to armor or weapons, the material provides a greasy surface that blunts impacts, causes blades to slide aside, and strengthens the gear it is applied to. A single container holds enough sunderblock to coat a single weapon or suit of armor as a full-round action. The effects aren't pronounced enough to increase the Armor Class bonus of a suit of armor, but the hardness of armors and weapons coated with sunderblock increases by 5. This bonus lasts for 12 hours, at which point the greasy substance dries and flakes away.
