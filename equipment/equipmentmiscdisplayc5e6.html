Description

This small vial contains an alchemical suspension that preserves a sample of pallid gift. This functions like <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay3faf.html?ItemName=Plague%20powder">plague powder</a> for <a href="monstertemplates12b4.html?ItemName=Pallid%20Vector">pallid gift</a> (DC 20), allowing the user to apply pallid gift to a weapon (a standard action, or whatever action the character normally takes to apply poison to a weapon if that is better) and deliver it as with an injury poison. Just as for plague powder, the creation of a pallid suspension exposes the crafter to the disease on each day of crafting.
