Description

This alchemical salve strengthens the material of a weapon, improves its balance, gives it greater flexibility without sacrificing resilience, and enhances its ability to hold an edge or point and survive an impact. An application turns a typical nonmagical melee weapon into a masterwork weapon. A double weapon requires 2 doses of exemplar weapon salve, and 50 arrows, bolts, or similar ammunition can be enhanced by a single application.
