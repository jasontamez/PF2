Description

A nature climbing harness is a series of buckles, straps, and trusses that can be worn over clothing or light armor. As a standard action, you can secure yourself in place on a vertical surface so that both your hands are free. You can remain in this position without needing to attempt additional Climb checks, and you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to your AC as long as you remain anchored. As long as you are anchored in this way, you cannot move, but you gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to avoid falling whenever you take damage. You can release yourself to start moving again as a move action.
