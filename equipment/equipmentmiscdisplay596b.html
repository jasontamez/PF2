Description

These alchemically treated incense sticks contain pheromones that certain creatures find repellent. Each odor stalk is created to irritate a specific creature type. After burning for 1 round, an odor stalk fills a 10-foot square with a clear gas that causes any living creature of the prescribed type to become nauseated for 1 round, then sickened for as long as it remains in the area. On a successful DC 12 Fortitude save, the creature negates the nauseated condition but not the sickened condition. This is a poison effect. The cloud lasts for 10 minutes, but can be dispersed like obscuring mist. Additionally, odor stalks can be used as an additional spell component for the following spells to modify the spell's effects.

Ghoul touch: The stench only affects creatures of the odor stalk's associated creature type.

Repel vermin: The spell functions as written, but applies to the odor stalk's associated creature type instead of to vermin. The Will save DC is always 12 when using this component.

Stinking cloud: The Fortitude save DC increases by 1 for creatures of the odor stalk's prescribed type, but decreases by 1 for all other creature types.
