Description

This disguise kit includes metallic or stone-colored makeup and cloth that you can apply to appear to be a statue; it grants a +2 bonus only on Disguise checks to resemble metal, stone, or similar materials. You take a -5 penalty on Disguise checks when impersonating an inanimate object. A viewer can attempt a single Perception check opposed by your Disguise check upon viewing you, and an additional check each time a creature interacts with you. This kit is exhausted after 10 uses.
