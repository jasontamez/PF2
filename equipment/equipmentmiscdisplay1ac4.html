Description

Whether made of sheer gauze or thicker material, a veil is useful for hiding one's facial expressions. While worn, a veil grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks; however, the wearer treats all other creatures as having concealment. The wearer has a 50% chance to avoid gaze attacks, as if averting his eyes.
