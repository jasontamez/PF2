Description

This gritty red paste makes you appear as if you were covered in dried blood. When you apply imposing war paint as a full-round action, you gain a +4 alchemical bonus on Intimidate checks and the duration of any fear effects you create increases by 50% as long as you wear the war paint. Unfortunately, imposing war paint is made with realgar, which is toxic to living creatures. If you wear imposing war paint for more than 1 minute per day, you take 1 point of Constitution damage, plus 1 point of Constitution damage for every minute you wear the paint that day after the first.
