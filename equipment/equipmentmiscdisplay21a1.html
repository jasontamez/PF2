Description

This large wood-and-canvas fan is 2 feet wide and ideal for quickly dispersing smoke or other harmful gases. While waving a dissipating fan, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws to avoid taking nonlethal damage from heat exposure and to avoid the effects of smoke inhalation. You can use a dissipating fan to clear nonmagical smoke, fog, or similar vapors from your square or an adjacent square as a full-round action-although dense smoke or fog in the surrounding area eventually refills the space (how long this takes depends on the source and the size of the area, at the GM's discretion). When folded and closed, a dissipating fan is the size of a thick walking stick. Some dissipating fans are decorated with paint or elaborate embroidery, and have a higher price to reflect their adornment.
