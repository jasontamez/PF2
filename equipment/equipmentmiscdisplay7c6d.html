Description

Typically found in forested areas, these Tiny scorpions sport pincers too small to be dangerous to anything larger than an insect, but they still possess a poisonous stinger. Sometimes they are kept as pets or serve as familiars. Greensting scorpions employed as familiars have an Intelligence score and lose the mindless trait. More information on greensting scorpions can be found in Ultimate Magic.
