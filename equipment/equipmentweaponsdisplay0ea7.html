Description

The most basic close assault weapons are iron-shod logs carried by one or more creatures to combine their strength. A ram can be used to deal damage or to make a Strength check against the target's break DC.

Ramming Charge: Rams require momentum to be effective. All creatures using the ram must use the charge action to gain its full effect. Creatures not wishing to charge may make a ram attack as a full-round action, taking a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls and Strength checks with the ram.

Breaking: The crew leader makes a Strength check with a +2 bonus, adding +2 for each member of the crew (or equivalent number of larger creatures; see <a href="rulesb2fb.html?Name=Siege%20Engine%20Rules&amp;Category=Siege%20Engines">Crew under Siege Engine Rules</a>) assisting. The ram also provides a +4 bonus per size category above Medium.

Damage: The crew leader makes an attack roll with a -4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals the listed damage, plus the Strength modifiers of the crew leader and all members of the crew, regardless of their size.

Improvised Ram: Any tree, log, or timber can be used as a ram with a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls and Strength checks.

Pick: A ram with a pick head grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage rolls made against stone structures.

Screw: A ram with a screw head grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and attack and damage rolls made against earthen structures.

Gallery Ram: This is a ram suspended from chains or ropes within a gallery. A gallery ram does not require a charge action for full momentum. In addition, adding tethers to the back end of the ram allows four additional crew members to assist in using the ram.

Hit Points: Rams have a hardness of 5 and hit points based on their size. A Large ram has 30 hit points, a Huge one has 120 hit points, a Gargantuan one has 320 hit points, and a Colossal one has 625 hit points. Improvised rams have half the normal hit points.
