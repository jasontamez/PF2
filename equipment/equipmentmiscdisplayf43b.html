Description

These crushed and shredded leaves range in color from peppery red to black; users can either smoke or chew them. Tobacco users experience a certain level of calm and are more easily able to shrug off hunger pangs. Tobacco is addictive (Fort DC 10 to resist), and long-term users suffer Constitution damage.
