Description

This slightly oversized ring conceals a few lockpicks and other tools coiled inside its band. These discreet tools, made of a metal alloy that springs straight once the tool is removed from the band, are sufficient to attempt Disable Device checks without penalty, and long enough to pick locks on manacles fastened around the wearer's hands (once she slips off the ring). The wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal the ring's nature from anyone searching her.
