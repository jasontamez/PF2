Description

This slimy gray unguent distorts wavelengths of light beyond of the normal visual spectrum, causing you to appear blurry to creatures using darkvision. Applying the camouflage takes 1 minute and provides a +4 alchemical bonus on Stealth checks against creatures relying on darkvision to see. One dose of monochrome camouflage lasts for 1 hour.
