Description

This outfit consists of fitted pants, a shirt, a hooded reversible cloak, soft leather boots, and a face mask, all in dark or neutral colors. The outfit's few buttons and rivets are wrapped in dull, dark cloth to avoid jingling or reflecting light. A number of loops and shallow pockets are also worked into the outfit, providing ample spaces for stashing small tools or weapons.
