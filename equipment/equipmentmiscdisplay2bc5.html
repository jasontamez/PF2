Description

These sturdy and majestic caribou roam the northern tundra in great herds, and provide fur, meat, and other useful products to both Erutaki and Varki herders and hunters. Irrisen's Jadwiga, Snowcaster elves, and eccentric Linnorm Kings use domesticated reindeer to pull sleighs. Reindeer use the same statistics as elk (see Bestiary 3, page 147).
