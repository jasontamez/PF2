Description

This alchemical perfume is distilled from a blend of humanoid pheromones and fey sweat. When applied as a full-round action, it grants the wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks for 1 hour. During this time, the wearer takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against charm and fascination effects originating from fey.

Long-term use of lover's breath eventually results in physical changes, causing the user to vaguely resemble a fey creature such as a nymph or dryad, although these changes are only cosmetic.
