Description

This wood-and-leather harness fits over clothing or armor and provides small handles and footrests across your back and along the sides of your legs and arms. While wearing a handle harness, you automatically succeed at checks to aid an adjacent ally of your size or smaller with Climb or Ride checks, or Acrobatics checks to balance on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. A handle harness's ungainly construction gives you a -2 penalty on Escape Artist checks.
