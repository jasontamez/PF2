Description

Pirates who lose a hand in the course of their adventures sometimes attach hooks to their wrists. Hook hands can't be disarmed. They generally don't interfere with day-to-day activities, but can't be used for tasks that would require an actual hand (such as completing somatic components, drawing arrows, or holding a weapon with both hands).
