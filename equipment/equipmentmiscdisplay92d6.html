Description

A scribe is a literate person with clear handwriting who can take dictation or transcribe text documents. You must provide ink and writing materials, though the scribe can acquire these for you at half price. Scribes cannot copy magical writing. A scribe who can accurately copy a map is rare and demands a higher wage. The listed price is per day.
