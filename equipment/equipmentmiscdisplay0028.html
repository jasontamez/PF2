Description

This is an elegantly styled, gem-encrusted drinking chalice made of smooth jade, obsidian, or a burnished fine metal. The chalice has a hidden compartment in the stem that allows for the insertion of a single vial of poison. The user doesn't risk poisoning himself when inserting the vial. Inside the compartment is a needle that siphons the poison from the vial and injects it into the bowl of the goblet. A hidden button (DC 20 Perception to locate) on the side of the stem begins the transfer of poison into the bowl. The transfer process takes 1 minute to complete, after which the hidden poison is emptied into the goblet.
