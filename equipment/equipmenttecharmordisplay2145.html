Description

A scatterlight suit is a tight, form-fitting suit of highly reflective polymers and synthetic metal fibers. It's designed to reflect beam weapon attacks, and provides only minimal protection against physical damage. Activating a scatterlight suit is a standard action; once activated, the suit diffuses and blurs light reflected from its surface, making the wearer appear hazy and indistinct. While active, a scatterlight suit increases the wearer's touch AC by a variable amount-this bonus is an armor bonus, but does not increase the wearer's normal or flatfooted AC beyond the scatterlight suit's baseline armor bonus of +1. This bonus to touch AC only applies to attacks made by beam weapons and rays-it does not provide additional protection to other touch attacks.
