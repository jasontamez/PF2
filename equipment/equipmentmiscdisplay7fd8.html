Description

Each carefully forged link of these masterwork manacles (with a good lock) contains a parable or other quotes excerpted from sacred texts. Activating the focus increases its Disable Device, Escape Artist, and break DCs by 5; its hardness increases by 2 and its hit points by 4. This effect lasts 24 hours or until the creature frees itself or is released.
