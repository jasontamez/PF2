Description

This pair of hammers is linked by a loose chain. While the two hammers are balanced to wield in melee together, the chain is long enough that you can throw one hammer a short distance and then pull it back; pulling the chain to retrieve the thrown hammer is a move action. The chain-hammer's maximum throwing range is 10 feet. Dwarf rangers are fond of using chain-hammers, often using a locked gauntlet to make sure one of the hammers remains secure.
