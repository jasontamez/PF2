Description

This purple incense is a powerful aid to amnesiacs and those prone to nocturnal fits. A creature that sleeps for at least 1 hour within 10 feet of burning memory incense retains any memories accrued within the next 24 hours, even those that would normally be lost to effects such as lycanthropic transformation. In addition, the creature gains a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws against effects that modify or erase memories for this duration. A single stick of memory incense can burn for 4 hours. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
