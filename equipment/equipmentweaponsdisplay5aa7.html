Description

Blade boots come with a spring-mounted knife that pops out when triggered with the right combination of toe presses. You can use a blade boot as an off-hand weapon. Releasing the knife is a swift action; rearming it is a full-round action. When the blade is extended, you treat normal terrain as difficult and difficult terrain as impassable.
