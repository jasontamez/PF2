Description

This single case conceals a pair of matched fighting swords perfectly balanced to be wielded as a pair. Despite their name, the blades more closely resemble the shorter wakizashi. When drawn, the blades use the statistics listed on the table. When the blades are concealed in their case, this weapon can be used as a quarterstaff.
