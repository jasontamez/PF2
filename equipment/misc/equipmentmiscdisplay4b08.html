Description

Although it's often packaged and sold as a cure-all, this nefarious snake-oil concoction temporarily weakens the immune system of whoever consumes it, accelerating the rate at which the drinker suffers from a contracted poison or disease.

Consuming the iniquitous panacea while suffering the effects of a disease or poison increases the DCs of the imbiber's next three Fortitude saving throws against the disease or poison by 2 and halves the remaining onset time of any contracted diseases or poisons that have not yet taken effect; these effects wear off after 24 hours. An iniquitous panacea has no effect on creatures that have not contracted a disease or a poison. Crafting an iniquitous panacea requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.
