Description

Published in 4707 ar, this volume is notable for the detailed account by Koriah Azmeren of her exploration of the Darklands. Her confirmation that the legendary drow were in fact real drove the elves of Kyonin-who had maintained the secret of the drow's existence for millennia-to attempt to bribe the Decemvirate into recalling and altering the book. The Society didn't relent, however, making the existence of dark elves a widely accepted fact within only a few years' time. Other reports in this volume include a brief essay by current venturecaptain Sheila Heidmarch regarding ancient relics of the old empire of Thassilon.
