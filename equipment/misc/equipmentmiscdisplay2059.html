Description

Working animals are universal, but the animal type varies according to local availability. Elephants carry goods in much of the Mwangi Expanse. Yaks pull loads in mountainous regions. In many other parts of the Inner Sea, donkeys, mules, and oxen pull carts or plows. The donkey market in Katapesh is particularly brisk.
