Description

This trap consists of a buoyant balloon tied to an anchor by a very
thin strand of metal. The strand acts as a vertical tripwire that
triggers the trap, targeting any flying creature that contacts it.
The trap's creator may set any number of mechanical or magical
effects to be triggered when the trap is activated. Balloon traps
are especially useful against creatures with large wingspans, or
when the balloon is concealed, as in a tree canopy or smoke
cover. Below is a sample balloon trap.
