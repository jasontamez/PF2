Description

Non-halflings do not receive any bonus from this drink. Most races find this pale and frothy beer too salty to swallow, but halflings simply consider it an acquired taste. Drinking three or more cups of Luglurch in a 1-minute span gives a halfling a -2 penalty on Perception checks and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves and Acrobatics checks for 10 minutes.
