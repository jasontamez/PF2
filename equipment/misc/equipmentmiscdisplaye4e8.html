Description

This mixture of flour, powdered milk, natron, sugar, and salt lasts for months in a sealed container. When mixed with water (eggs are optional), it creates a batter you can use to make biscuits (or other quickbreads such as pancakes, waffles, scones, or muffins) or a cake. One pound of travel cake mix makes a dozen biscuits.
