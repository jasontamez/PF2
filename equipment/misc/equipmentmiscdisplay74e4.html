Description

This pill causes the imbiber's skin to shift colors and patterns to match whatever is behind her. As long as a significant portion of her skin is exposed (her head and forearms, for example), the imbiber gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks for 4 hours. This bonus doesn't stack with that granted by invisibility, vanish, or similar magical effects. Crafting a chameleon pill requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.

Construction
