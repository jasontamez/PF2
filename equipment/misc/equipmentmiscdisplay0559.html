Description

This small chime is designed to be used in aquatic environs. After submerging the pinger in water, the user can lower a miniature mallet into the dry hollow of the chime from above and ring the instrument with a successful DC 5 Perform (percussion) check. An aquatic pinger can be heard clearly from up to a half-mile away by underwater creatures (Perception DC 0). For each halfmile beyond, Perception checks to hear an aquatic pinger take a -2 penalty.
