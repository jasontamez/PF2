Description

Through a 15-minute assembly period, the components of this kit fit together into a tentlike structure. Able to fit a single Medium-sized creature, this tent doesn't allow space for sleeping. Instead, a privacy shelter offers standing or sitting room only. The shelter is mostly used as either a meditation space or a latrine shelter.
