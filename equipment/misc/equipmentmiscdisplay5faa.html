Description

A rare and dangerous marvel
from the strange nation of
Alkenstar, this light, airborne
device is held aloft by a
huge buoyant balloon which
is attached by chains to an
open-air wicker basket.

A wind platform is socalled
because it remains at the mercy of the winds, as it has
no propulsion system of its own and can therefor not be used
as much more than an airborne watchtower or platform for the
deployment of siege engines.

The basket of a wind platform can hold as many as six
Medium creatures and two Large direct-fire siege engines,
or any combination of smaller creatures and siege engines
occupying the same space. The platform cannot withstand a
carried weight of more than 3,000 lbs.

A wind platform has AC 4, harness 5, and 250 hp, and takes
double damage from acid and fire attacks. When reduced to
half its total hit points (125 hp) the platform begins to descend
at a rate of 20 ft. per round. When reduced to one-quarter its
total hit points (62 hp), the rate of descent increases to 60 ft.
per round. When destroyed, all creatures and items on the
wind platform simply fall as normal.
