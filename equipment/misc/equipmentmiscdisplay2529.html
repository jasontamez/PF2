Description

These connected glass-and-copper apparatuses have heatstones and other components installed at the base of each container to break down magic liquids placed within. Any potion placed within the extractor is distilled down to its component parts over the course of 4 hours; this destroys the potion. The extracted essences can then be used to brew a new potion as long as the new potion is of the same spell level or lower than the distilled potion. Using the extractor in this way does not change the requirements for brewing a potion, but it does remove the need to use fresh and unused ingredients and materials to brew the new potion, and this waives the new potion's base cost (but not the requirement to provide any costly material component or focus that the new potion's spell requires). Essences extracted from a potion using a reagent extractor must be used to create a new potion within 24 hours; after this time, they become inert.
