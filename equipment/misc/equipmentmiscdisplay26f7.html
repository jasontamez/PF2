Description

Favored by performers of all kinds, this tincture is a blend of alchemically enhanced herbs and spices mixed into a pint of ale. For 6 hours after drinking this tincture, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on Bluff and Perform checks, and you treat your level as 1 higher for the purpose of determining the effects of a bardic performance or a raging song. The potent drink causes you take a -2 penalty on Acrobatics, Intimidate, Knowledge, Sense Motive, and Spellcraft checks for the same duration.
