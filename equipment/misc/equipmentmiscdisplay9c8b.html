Description

Generally composed of meat, hard cheese, fruits and vegetables, nut and bean pastes, and vital herbs, space rations are dehydrated and then kept extremely dry in order to maximize preservation and storage efficiency. A single serving feeds a Medium character for 1 day, but unless an equal weight of water is added to the rations, the character eating them becomes fatigued until she drinks enough water.
