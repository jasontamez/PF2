Description

Every spring, the waters south of Iblydos fill with the newly hatched young of the archipelago's immense lonoma eels, which fishermen harvest and brine to preserve for year-round consumption. Traditionally consumed as sailors' meals before long voyages to regain one's sea legs, lonoma eel grants a +2 competence bonus on concentration checks required for vigorous or violent motion for 8 hours.

The price listed is for a single serving of lonoma eel.
