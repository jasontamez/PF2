Description

A favorite of Ustalavic alchemists, this pale sludge hampers your fear response, granting a +2 alchemical bonus on your saves against fear effects. The concoction's necrotic components dull healing, however, causing you to regain 2 fewer hit points from healing effects (to a minimum of 1 point of healing per effect).
