Description

The daring bravo is equally adept in social situations and combat, with the right equipment to move fluidly from one to the other. Such adventurers are known as much for their flair and panache as their martial prowess, and the daring bravo's equipment is often ornately ornamented or personalized. This equipment package is good for a bard, fighter, rogue, swashbuckler, or vigilante. Certain cavaliers, investigators, skalds, or even paladins may also find it appealing. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.
