Description

These earthenware vats are made from a special clay sludge dredged from Oenopion's central lake and infused with ooze distillates. After being fired in a massive kiln, an oozing vat is typically embedded with glass-fiber tubing designed to carry electrical charges to growing oozes. In order to craft an ooze creature using the Craft Ooze feat (see page 22), a creator must have access to an oozing vat large enough to contain the created ooze.
