Description

This specialized scroll case can hold a single scroll and features a leather strap to hang the case from a belt or backpack. Retrieving the scroll held within is a swift action. Preparing the case for this use requires cranking the case's tiny gears and springs into place (a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity).
