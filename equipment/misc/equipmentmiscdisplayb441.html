Description

This device resembles an ordinary compass, save that it is filled with alcohol and water, in which bob two pieces of alchemically treated metal (one silver and one iron). A spirit compass can be operated by a creature so as to allow the user to employ Survival in place of Perception to notice haunts (it provides no benefit toward detecting those unusual haunts that are not noticed by Perception checks). A creature that is untrained in Survival takes a -4 penalty on any Survival checks when attempting to use a spirit compass in this manner, representing the action of focusing on the compass rather than one's surroundings.
