Description

Designed by dwarves, this iron potbellied stove is about the size of a halfling. It burns wood, coal, dung, or fungus stalks, and has a large moveable compartment on the outside to hold maturing owlbear eggs. The stoves need constant attention to maintain the right temperature, else the eggs get cooked rather than incubated. Some variations have a spring- or crank-turned device that turns the eggs.
