Light Chariots: These chariots are often used for racing or as the platform for a single archer charging across the battlefield at high speed.

Medium Chariots: These chariots are used in battle to break apart infantry formations or as fast-moving fighting platforms.

Heavy Chariots: This type of chariot is typically used as a fighting platform or for transporting material quickly onto the battlefield.
