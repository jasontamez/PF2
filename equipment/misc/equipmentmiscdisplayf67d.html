Description

This silk cape is constructed of many carefully arranged overlapping layers that are loosely stitched together. When exposed to a sudden influx of air, like that caused by falling, the cloak unfolds like a crude parachute. When falling, a creature wearing a billow cape is treated as if he had deliberately jumped from the height. When worn in areas of strong wind or greater, a billow cape hampers movement. In such wind conditions, the wearer treats all terrain as difficult terrain and takes a -4 penalty on Fly checks. Because of the strange and somewhat fragile construction of this cape, only Small or smaller billow capes function properly. Larger billow capes take all the penalties resulting from high winds, but grant none of the benefits when the wearer falls.
