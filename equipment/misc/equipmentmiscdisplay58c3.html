Description

A blightburn reader is a small wooden or metal frame, roughly 2 inches wide and 4 inches long, containing a specially prepared alchemical paper pressed between two thin panes of glass. Whenever a character wearing a blightburn reader enters an area with a radiation hazard (such as those presented on page 24), the paper within changes from white to black over the course of 1 minute. Once the paper turns black, it is destroyed and must be replaced at a cost of 15 gp before the blightburn reader can be used again.
