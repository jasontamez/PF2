Description

An esquire attaché case contains the materials and references for drafting agreements and treaties. Carried by ambassadors and diplomats, these kits hold masterwork writing implements, fine parchments, special inks, and references on the legal languages of specific nations or regions. When purchasing a kit, you must select a nation or region. An esquire attaché case grants you a +2 circumstance bonus when used to draft diplomatic and legal documents in the chosen nation or region. These are typically Profession (barrister) checks, but may include other checks related to creating documents, such as Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), or Linguistics.
