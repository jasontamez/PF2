Description

This wooden board bears a number of narrow, thin holes large enough to hold by the fingertips. The board mounts to a wall, allowing climbers to practice their technique and improve their grip by hanging from the board. Using a hanging board to improve your grip requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 18 Climb check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +10 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to catch yourself while falling and a +5 bonus to catch a falling character while climbing. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.
