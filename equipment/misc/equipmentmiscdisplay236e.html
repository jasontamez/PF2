Description

Underwater pens fill the grooves carved into underwater paper with ink; as such, they work somewhat like a syringe, drawing ink from a waterproof bladder and then gently releasing it into the grooves as the writer traces them with the pen. These pens function equally well at depositing ink into tablets, underwater paper, walls, or anything with carved writing.
