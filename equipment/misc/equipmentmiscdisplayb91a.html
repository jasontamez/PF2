Description

Named after a ferocious unicorn-tiger hybrid, this suit of scale mail barding bears a vicious horn on the forehead plate and metal tiger claws protruding from the poitrel. The armor is heavily reinforced to protect a horse's chest and neck. A horse wearing poh armor gains a gore attack as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d8 points of damage. Additionally, a horse wearing poh armor deals 2d6 points of damage to any foe it knocks prone when using an overrun combat maneuver. Poh armor otherwise functions like barding.
