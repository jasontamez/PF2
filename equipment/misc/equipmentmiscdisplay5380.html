Description

This kit for a wagon provides a set of metal bars with a door for transporting imprisoned people or creatures. Though portable prisons were originally developed by traveling acts to hold ferocious animals, city guards commonly use them to round up criminals, and some bounty hunters hire them to transport large groups of prisoners. Most prisons come with locks; add the cost of the desired lock to the cost of the portable prison. A cage meant for people includes benches and rails for manacles. One meant for animals contains a trough for water and a smaller door for providing food.
