Description

Originally developed by kami-revering priests to write prayer scrolls, this pale ink is now often used by ninjas to mark locations or leave messages. Once spirit-vision ink dries, it becomes completely invisible. To invisible creatures, however, writing in spirit-vision ink shimmers with a rich azure hue.
