Description

This clear liquid glows with pale light. For 4 hours after drinking this tincture, you emit light as a torch. You are constantly dazzled during this time. If any effect would cause you to become dazzled during this time, you are instead blinded. While under the effect of this tincture, you can intensify your glow as a swift action to that of bright light, as per daylight, for 1 round. After activating the bright light effect, you emit only dim light with a range of 10 feet for the remainder of the tincture's duration.
