Description

A miner's bird is a Diminutive, semi-trained animal (typically a canary or other delicate songbird) in a portable cage. The enclosure is most often made of wood or metal. The bird within has 1 hit point, a Constitution score of 3, and a Fortitude save bonus of -2 (otherwise, its statistics are identical to a thrush). When the bird fails its first saving throw against a poison-based effect, it emits a loud chirping, audible within 60 feet.
