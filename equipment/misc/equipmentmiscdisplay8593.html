Description

This is a loaf of bread with a crust that ranges from crisp to soft, depending on the local ingredients and baking methods. Bread may be leavened or unleavened, depending on whether yeast is used to make it rise. Unleavened bread is also known as flatbread, and ranges in thickness from that of a cracker to half an inch thick. Both leavened and unleavened bread may be stuffed with cheese, fruit, olives, meat, or other rich ingredients when prepared for festive occasions. Bread that is left exposed to air become dry and stale in about a day.
