Description

This 100-page book contains face drawings of male and female dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, halflings, and humans. By selecting an appropriate drawing and adding hair, a beard, or other small features such as moles or scars, even a poor artist can quickly create a reasonable likeness of a specific person-for example, an inquisitor making wanted posters of a half-elven witch.
