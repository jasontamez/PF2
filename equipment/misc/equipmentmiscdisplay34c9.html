Description

Loading this long bronze tube with a dose of ingested poison and 10 gp worth of gold dust is a standard action. When you blow on a poison belcher like a blowgun, it sprays the poison out the other end. The poison belcher is a simple weapon that strikes as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet and a maximum range of 30 feet. If hit, the target must save against the poison as if it had been ingested.
