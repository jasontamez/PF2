Description

Renowned for its energizing and defensive properties, dragon's blood has a variety of effects, depending on how it's used. In addition to use in its raw form, it's also valuable as an alchemical ingredient. Below are two common uses for dragon's blood, but clever dragoncrafters may invent new uses as well.

Drinking: When imbibed, a vial of dragon's blood heals 1d4 points of damage. It also grants a +1 alchemical bonus on Will and Fortitude saving throws for 1 minute.

Bathing: Covering oneself in dragon's blood removes 1 permanent negative level. No more than 1 permanent negative level can be removed from a single creature per week using this method. Bathing in dragon's blood requires 3 vials of dragon's blood. Blood used in such a manner is expended, and may not be reused.
