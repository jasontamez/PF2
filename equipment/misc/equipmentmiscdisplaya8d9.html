Description

This clear, viscous oil comes in a squat bottle with a dropper that dispenses one drop of oil at a time. When applied to an early or advanced firearm, it seeps into the weapon's inner workings and protects the gun from powder residue and everyday wear and tear. Applying firearm oil takes 1 minute; once applied, it reduces the misfire value of the firearm by 1 for 1 hour or until the firearm is discharged. Firearm oil can't reduce a firearm's misfire value to lower than 1. A single bottle contains enough oil for 20 applications on one-handed firearms (or 10 applications on two-handed firearms). Crafting firearm oil requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.
