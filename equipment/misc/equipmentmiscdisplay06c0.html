Description

A nurse is a person familiar with healing and medicine. A typical nurse is a 1st-level expert with 1 rank in Heal and the Skill Focus (Heal) feat. An experienced nurse is 3rd or 4th level, has additional ranks in Heal, and is paid two to three times as much; however, these nurses are in high demand and are normally employed full-time by wealthy merchants or nobles to look after children and elderly family members. A nurse generally knows a little bit about what local magical healing can do and where to find it. The listed price is per day.
