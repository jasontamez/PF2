Description

A survival kit provides the necessary tools for day-to-day existence in a temperate wilderness. It typically contains a flint and steel, a mess kit, two waterskins (enough to hold water for 1 person for 1 day), very basic maps showing major landmarks, and a small utility knife.

A masterwork survival kit contains higher quality gear and a guide to identifying flora and fauna. It grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to get along in the wild, deal with severe weather, keep from getting lost, avoid natural hazards such as quicksand, and predict the weather.
