Description

A single tiny religious symbol adorns each ring in this matched pair. If two people each wear one of the rings and clasp hands, a cleric may activate both rings with one use of channel energy. If the person wearing one of these rings dies or removes it, the other ring instantly cracks; the wearer of the broken ring knows if it cracked because the other wearer died or the ring was removed.
