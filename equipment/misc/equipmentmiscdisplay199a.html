Description

At its simplest, a quintain is a swiveling pole with a pair of arms, although permanent quintains are more elaborate and often look like armored mannequins. One arm holds a wooden board shaped like a shield. The other arm has a padded flail attached. In a routine originally used to train knights, a user rides past a quintain and tries to hit the board with a weapon, and then get out of the way before the quintain swings around to strike him with its flail in retaliation. Training with a quintain requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 15 Ride check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Ride checks to stay in the saddle, guide with your knees, and control a combat-trained mount. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until you fail a Ride check.
