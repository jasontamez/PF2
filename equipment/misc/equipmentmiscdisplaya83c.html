Description

This kit covers all the basics for survival on potentially hostile planes. It contains basic written guides to the Outer Planes, phrasebooks for common outsider languages and tips on the ecology of each plane-though these guides sometimes contain a measure of fanciful or dubious advice. While on a plane other than the Material Plane, a planar traveler's kit grants +2 circumstance bonuses on Survival checks, Knowledge (planes) checks, and Linguistics checks made to communicate with outsiders or decipher outsider texts.
