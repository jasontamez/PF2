Description

These oversized shoes are worn over normal footwear. They create footprints or bootprints that look like those left by another creature. Each pair creates a specific type of footprint, such as tiger, orc, goblin, or ogre. When walking with these shoes, you may make a Survival check; the check result is the Survival DC for anyone trying to determine whether the tracks are what they appear to be.
