Description

These tiny rodents are as common in the wild as rats are in cities. They typically eat nuts, seeds, and vegetation. Squirrels have the same statistics as rats (see the Bestiary).

Flying squirrel: These Tiny squirrels use a membrane of skin between their front and hind legs to glide. They sometimes serve spellcasters as familiars. More information on flying squirrels can be found in the Bestiary 3.
