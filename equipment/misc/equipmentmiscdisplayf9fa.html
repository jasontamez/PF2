Description

This framework of interlocking metal arms is used to duplicate drawings, allowing enlarging (up to twice the original size) or shrinking (down to half the original size) of the copy in the process. The pantograph is anchored at one end, then fitted with a stylus and a writing implement such as chalk, an ink pen, or a pencil. As the stylus is traced over the drawing or other item to be duplicated, the pantograph reproduces the motions, creating a copy. While handy for making quick, accurate copies of ancient carvings, runes, and drawings, a pantograph is unable to produce a convincing forgery or duplicate magical writings such as scrolls. More elaborate and expensive pantographs allow even larger or smaller copies to be made, or multiple copies to be made at the same time.
