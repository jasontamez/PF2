Description

A musk kit consists of a dozen vials of concentrated fluids, prepared animal glands, and plant compounds. You can use the distinctly scented musks to mark possessions, locations, and trails which can then be identified or followed by scent. Some hunters dip their arrows or other weapons in the musk in order to use them to mark and track injured prey.

Alternatively, you can use up four vials from the musk kit at once to attract 2d6 Tiny animals to the location you marked with musk. The animals arrive in approximately 1 hour, and the group consists of those animals most common to the immediate area.
