Description

This waxy ball of resin and herbs is stored in a large glass jar or other airtight container. When the jar is opened, it instantly evaporates into a soothing vapor that renders the lungs of any adjacent creatures resistant to inhaled poisons, diseases, and irritants such as choking smoke. Each creature within 5 feet of the jar when it is opened gains a +5 alchemical bonus on saving throws against such effects for the next 10 minutes. If already affected by an airborne affliction, an affected creature can immediately attempt another saving throw against the effect (with the +5 bonus); a creature can attempt only one such additional saving throw in a 24-hour period.
