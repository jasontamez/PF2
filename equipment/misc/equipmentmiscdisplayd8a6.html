Description

This bright pink liquid can be added to the eyes of a willing homunculus as a standard action. If you are the homunculus's master, you gain the ability to see through the homunculus's eyes by closing yours and concentrating, and the homunculus can see through yours in the same fashion. The eye drops also extend the range of the homunculus's telepathic link to 1 mile. The effects of the eye drops fade after 1 day.
