Description

A laboratory-created version of the expensive and infamous Osirian drug mumia (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms 21), synthetic mumia is a mixture of honey, embalming fluids, and various animal organs. The murky liquid comes enclosed in small packets made of intestine. Mumia and synthetic mumia may be taken interchangeably to stave off the effects of addiction to either substance, and is thus used by some mumia junkies hoping to quit their addiction. Crafting synthetic mumia requires a successful DC 14 Craft (Alchemy) check.
