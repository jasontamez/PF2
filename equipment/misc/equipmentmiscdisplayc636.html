Description

Tribal fetishes vary from tribe to tribe, but are generally small, carved wooden or stone religious symbols, luck tokens, or curious naturally occurring objects specially carved to resemble something of significance (such as an acorn with a wolf fangs, a dried mushroom with skull-shaped blotches, or a stone with a lizard carved on it). A goblin divine spellcaster can use a tribal fetish as a divine focus for spellcasting.
