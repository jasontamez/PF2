Description

Used as a replacement for the heel and sole of a shoe or boot, a puzzle heel can be used to secret away items so you can retrieve them when needed. To open the small compartment inside a puzzle heel, you must press, turn, and twist the heel and sole in a particular pattern. The increased complexity of a puzzle heel grants a circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal items, depending on the complexity of the opening process. Opening the heel without knowing the sequence requires a successful Disable Device check. A puzzle heel compartment is roughly 5 cubic inches in volume. <table class="inner"><tr><td>Complexity</td><td>Price</td><td>Sleight of Hand bonus</td><td>Disable Device DC</td></tr> <tr><td>3 steps</td><td>20 gp</td><td>+4</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>4 steps</td><td>40 gp</td><td>+6</td><td>25</td></tr> <tr><td>5 steps</td><td>80 gp</td><td>+8</td><td>30</td></tr> </table>
