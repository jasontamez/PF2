Description

This jar contains 6 ounces of alchemically preserved <a href="monsterdisplay2a84.html?ItemName=Aboleth">aboleth</a> mucus. When 1 ounce of the extract is applied to a living creature's mouth, nose, and throat (a full-round action), the target loses its ability to breathe air but gains the ability to breathe water for 1 hour. An unwilling target can attempt a DC 14 Fortitude save to negate the effect. If additional doses are applied to the same creature, the duration of the effect extends by 1 hour for each ounce used, to a maximum of 3 hours.
