Description

The powder in this minute glass vial is made of caustic soda treated with consecrated ashes, and is harmless to living flesh but dangerous to the deceased. Necrosalt can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 5 feet. On a successful ranged touch attack, 1 dose of necrosalt deals 1d4 points of damage to a struck corporeal undead creature. For 3 rounds afterward, it deals an additional 1d4 points of damage to its victim at the beginning of the victim's turn. Intelligent undead creatures can brush necrosalt off their bodies and end its effect as a move action. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check.
