Description

These faintly glowing lozenges often come in a discrete brown pouch. A single venombane lozenge lasts for 5 minutes after being placed in a creature's mouth. During this time, the user gains a cumulative +1 alchemical bonus on saving throws against poisons every minute for 5 minutes. At the end of the 5 minutes, the lozenge dissolves and its effects end. If at any time the user becomes poisoned while under the effects of a lozenge that has not dissolved, she can crush the lozenge to immediately gain the benefits for 1 round as if it had lasted its full duration. Using a lozenge in this way immediately ends the effect.
