Description

The space at the bottom of this sword scabbard is just large enough to hold a potion flask. Some are accessed from the outside; others open on the inside with a secret catch at the top end. Finding the secret compartment requires a DC 25 Perception check, or DC 20 if you can compare the sword's length to that of the scabbard.
