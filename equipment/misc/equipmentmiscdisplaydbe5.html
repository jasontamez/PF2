Description

These nocturnal hunter-scavengers are found primarily in forested terrains, and are noted for their domino mask-like visages, highly dextrous forepaws (which they rely on for their hyper-sensitive sense of touch), and the strangely anthropomorphic tendency to "wash" their food in water before eating it. Raccoons are sometimes kept as pets and used by some spellcasters as familiars. More information on raccoons can be found in Bestiary 3.
