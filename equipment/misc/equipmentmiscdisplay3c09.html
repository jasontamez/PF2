Description

These boot attachments consist of wide wooden frames, leather straps, and thin leather soles with no distinguishing marks or texture. They distribute your weight over a larger area and obscure the shape of your footprints. The DC to track you increases by 2, but you also take a -2 penalty on Acrobatics and Stealth checks.
