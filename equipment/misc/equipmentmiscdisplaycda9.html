Description

This platform can be secured to a tree in order to elevate you and give you a better vantage point. It takes 1 minute to secure a hunter's stand. Once in the stand, you gain the benefit of higher ground bonus and partial cover from anyone below the stand's height. A hunter's stand can be upgraded with a camouflage blind (5 gp), which allows full concealment, or an all-weather cover (10 gp), which provides a +1 circumstance bonus on saves against dust storms, rain, snow, or other adverse weather conditions.
