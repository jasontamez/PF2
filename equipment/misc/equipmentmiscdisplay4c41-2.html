Description

This kit provides useful tools for bounty hunters. It includes basic maps showing major landmarks, caltrops, common manacles with an average lock, a net, a sap, and a 10-foot chain. Bounty hunters are notoriously individualistic, so variant kits are common. One such variant is the superior bounty hunter's kit, which replaces the common manacles with masterwork manacles and the average lock with a good lock, and includes a footprint book, a tanglefoot bag, and masterwork thieves' tools.
