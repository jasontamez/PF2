Description

Numerous volumes and editions of the Pathfinder Chronicles exist. When used as a reference (an action that takes 1d4 full rounds of searching the text), a Pathfinder Chronicle grants a +2 circumstance bonus on a specific Knowledge check. Each Pathfinder Chronicle grants this bonus to a different type of Knowledge. Regardless of which type that particular chronicle is focused on, the cost of the book remains the same.
