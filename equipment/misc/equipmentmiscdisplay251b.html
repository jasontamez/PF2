Preparation A dose of winterbite must be dried near an open flame in which certain alchemically treated sawdust and wood chips are burned. This requires a successful DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check and 1 hour.
Use When held under the nose and crushed (which takes a standard action), a dose of prepared winterbite releases a pungent, sweet odor that clears the sinuses and sharpens the senses. For the next hour, the user of a dose of prepared winterbite gains a +2 alchemical bonus on scent-based Perception checks.
