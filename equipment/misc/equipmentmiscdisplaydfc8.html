Description

This rare and expensive variant of standard Garundi pesh is produced by introducing a vial of dragon's blood into a dose of pesh during the refining process, and has a noticeable reddish tint. While the drug provides a more potent high and fewer immediate penalties, it is highly addictive, and unless a user has a steady supply of dragon's blood, the cost to her wellbeing can be severe. For more information on drugs and addictions, see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide.
