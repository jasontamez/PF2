Description

Sneaks and thieves know the value of a good disguise. The ability to remove that disguise in a hurry, thus revealing the next layer of disguise, is nearly as valuable. Tear-away clothing is generally loose fitting and allows another layer of clothing to be worn underneath. The seams on this clothing are designed to break easily, making it a simple matter (a standard action) to remove these items and walk away with none the wiser. Any outfit can be crafted as tear-away clothing for an additional price.
