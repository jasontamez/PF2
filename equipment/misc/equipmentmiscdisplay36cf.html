Description

This mixture of seed and dead insects is suitable food for small birds such as ravens, crows, and chickens. Birds of prey such as falcons, hawks, and owls can also sustain themselves on bird feed, though they typically require at least two servings per day. Larger avian creatures such as axe beaks and griffons require larger portions of meat, and cannot survive on bird feed alone.
