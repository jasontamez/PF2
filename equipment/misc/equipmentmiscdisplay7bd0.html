Description

This mask is a representation of Nethys's own. Activating the mask charges it with healing power. If a member of Nethys' faith wears the mask when it is activated, the first time the wearer takes damage, the mask releases the stored energy into the wearer, healing a number of hit points equal to the number of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The mask heals its wearer regardless of the type of channeled energy used and whether the target is living or undead. This healing does not prevent the wearer from dying because of hit point damage, and is mainly used to provide instant healing when a cleric is occupied or can only channel a harmful kind of energy. The mask remains charged until it heals someone or 24 hours pass.
