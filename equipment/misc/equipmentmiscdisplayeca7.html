This decorative set of collars, cuffs, and trim pieces attaches to otherwise plain clothes. Frequent travelers, such as merchants or entertainers, use trim to blend in with the local styles without buying a new wardrobe. A traveling noble keeps extra sets for use by temporary staff and loaned guards.
