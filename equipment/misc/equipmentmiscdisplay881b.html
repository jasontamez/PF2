Description

These clothes are designed specifically to be expensive and gaudy, letting everyone know exactly how expensive they are. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing, along with elaborate embroidery, and some outfits may contain impractical concessions to high fashion. A would-be noble also needs a signet ring and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp) to accessorize this outfit.
