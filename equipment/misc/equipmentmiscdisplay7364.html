Description

This set of belts, buttons, straps, and metal pieces can be disassembled and reassembled with 1 minute of effort to create any light or one-handed melee or martial weapon with which the assembler is proficient (no further Craft check is required). It can be used this way repeatedly. All weapons created with a piecemeal weapon have and cannot lose the broken condition. A piecemeal weapon can be used to create only a single weapon at a time, and it can't be enhanced to create magical weapons. A light weapon created with a piecemeal weapon grants a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to hide it on one's person.
