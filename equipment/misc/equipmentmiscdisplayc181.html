Description

This is a chunk of meat big enough to be a meal. In most temperate locations, it is meat from a fish (or other seafood), pig (bacon, ham, or pork), sheep (lamb or mutton), chicken, quail, duck, goose, goat (chevon), rabbit, deer (venison), cow (beef), or horse. In other climates and cultures it may instead be meat from a moose, seal, whale, walrus, caribou, reindeer, dog, cat, alpaca, snake, rat, guinea pig, lizard, frog, or insect.

Inns with frequent adventurer clientele may have more exotic meats on the menu such as the meat of basilisks, dinosaurs, dire animals, giant scorpions, girallons, hydras, or shocker lizards, costing anywhere from 1-100 gp per meal depending on the danger and rarity of the creature.
