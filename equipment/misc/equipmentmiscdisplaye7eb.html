Description

A fire carrier is a conical device made of thickly insulated leather and wood designed to carry a live coal under a layer of ash. A fire carrier can keep a coal red hot for 24 hours and allows anyone to light a fire in normal conditions without having to resort to Survival checks, alchemical devices, or magic.
