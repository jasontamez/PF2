Description

This thick clay mixture comes in a jar stamped with a silhouette of whatever creature can be created using its contents. By adding a drop of blood to a scoop of homunculus clay, you can create a temporary homunculus that hardens and becomes fully animate in just 1 round. The character whose blood is used is treated as the homunculus's master. After 1 hour, a clay homunculus withers and dies, rapidly decaying into a viscous slime. The listed price is for a jar containing 3 doses of homunculus clay.
