Description

This sealed vial contains a highly potent indigo liquid and is an essential item for Dongun Hold miners, who often keep such vials handy for use against hostile subterranean creatures. The vial can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage; this damage is doubled against creatures made of crystal, earth, or metal. Every creature within 5 feet of the impact takes 1 point of acid damage. Crafting mineral acid requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
