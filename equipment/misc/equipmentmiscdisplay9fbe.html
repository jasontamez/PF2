Description

This lime-green goo turns your saliva venomous. Once during the concoction's duration, as a swift action, you can lick or spit on a held weapon to apply a dose of black adder venom to the weapon. If you are a vishkanya, you instead apply the poison granted by your toxic racial trait; this does not count against that trait's uses per day. The concoction weakens your physical defenses, imparting a -1 penalty on your Fortitude saving throws.
