Description

Originally brewed from waters adjacent to one of the Plane of Water's subaquatic suns, a vial of light of Axtarr glows like a candle until expended. A vial of light of Axtarr that is emptied underwater as a move action forms a small orb that sheds light like a sunrod for 1d6 hours, after which the item is expended. Such an underwater orb remains suspended in place, not sinking, floating, or drifting away unless moved by a creature. Above water, shaking a vial of light of Axtarr as a move action also makes it shed light like a sunrod for 1d6 hours, after which it is expended. Any area of normal light created by light of Axtarr protects creatures within it from cold temperatures as per endure elements. Alternatively, a spellcaster holding an unused vial of light of Axtarr can expend it as a free action to automatically succeed at a caster level check to cast a fire spell underwater. (Fire spells successfully cast underwater produce steam that still deals fire damage; for more details, see page 46 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures.) This alternative use does not cause the light of Axtarr to produce light. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check.
