Description

When applied to your body, this pale grease made from animal fat makes you more difficult to grapple. While covered in the grease, you gain a +4 bonus to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers. Applying the grease takes 1 minute, and once applied, its effects last for 10 minutes. You can't be wearing armor to gain the benefit of grappler's grease. Grappler's grease is usually sold in small clay jars that hold five applications.
