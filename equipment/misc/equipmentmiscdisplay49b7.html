Description

Meant to shelter its flame from both water and wind, this lantern treats severe winds as strong winds, windstorms as severe winds, and hurricanes as windstorms for the purpose of determining whether they extinguish its flame. It holds enough air to burn underwater for 5 rounds before going dark.
