Description

Ancestor worship is common among the peoples of the Mwangi Expanse, and many display wooden planks in their homes that contain depictions of enormous trees with the names of their ancestors carved onto branches. Ancestry planks made of darkwood are much lighter and smaller than their conventional counterparts, which make them appealing to Mwangi adventurers looking to honor their lineages while venturing away from home. Many from the Mwangi Expanse recognize the difficulty in obtaining darkwood and view those who carry darkwood ancestry planks with respect.
