Description

These deadly but majestic fliers are the favored aerial cavalry of many kingdoms. While griffons can be trained, some good deities consider doing so akin to enacting slavery, insisting that a griffon must come to its rider on its own free will. The price listed is for a trained griffon; free will is bought with different currency (determined by the GM). More information on griffons can be found in the Bestiary.
