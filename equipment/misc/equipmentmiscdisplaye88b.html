Description

Made using the choicest, most malleable skin from a dragon's
underbelly, this specialized weapon grip can be added to any
weapon with a hilt or handle. Dragonskin grips may be added to
an existing weapon, or incorporated into a new weapon during
crafting. The skin provides extra grip, granting the wielder a +2
bonus to CMD against disarm attempts.

Producing a dragonskin grip requires the Dragoncrafting feat
and a successful DC 15 Craft (bows or weapons) check.
