Description

This jar of thick, gritty paste is made from coarsely ground plant matter, weak epoxy, and bat  guano. When exposed to air, the moldable substance quickly creates a thin, paperlike surface, which is ideal for creating false earthen walls. Creating a 5-foot-by-5-foot section of paper wall requires a full-round action. Though this false wall is easy to punch through, it requires a successful DC 13 Perception check to identify the wall as a fake. If the creator of the paper wall spends an additional full-round action disguising the wall with dirt and pebbles, the DC increases by 2. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.
