Description

This mixture of scent-gland extracts and aromatic herbs serves as both attractor and olfactory camouflage. It masks the natural scent of a creature with a pungent musk that is alluring to animals. Beast-scent provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Handle Animal and wild empathy checks and a -5 penalty on attempts to track the wearer by his original scent. If the tracking creature is following the smell of beast-scent itself, Survival checks to track gain a +10 circumstance bonus instead.

A single vial of beast-scent masks the scent of one Medium creature or two smaller creatures; larger creatures require proportionally more to gain the benefits. Beast-scent becomes inert after 1 hour of exposure to air. Applying a vial is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
