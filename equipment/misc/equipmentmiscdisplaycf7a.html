This equipment package is appropriate for any lightly-armored combatant in the wild, such as a barbarian, hunter, or ranger. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch and holly and mistletoe. The GM might consider altering which weapon is masterwork, based on the PC's specialization. For example, an archery-focused ranger might prefer a masterwork composite longbow over a masterwork greataxe.
