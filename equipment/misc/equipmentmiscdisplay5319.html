Description

A short whip with a leather loop at the end, this whip can be felt through a horse's armor but does not deal damage to the horse. A rider who uses a horse whip while using the Ride skill to spur her mount does not deal damage to the mount, as opposed to the 1d3 points of damage normally dealt by this action. Using a horse whip does not negate the fatigue that spurring a mount can cause.
