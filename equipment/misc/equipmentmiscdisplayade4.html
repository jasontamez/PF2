Description

This large contraption functions
like a hooded lantern, shedding
large amounts of light in a
single direction. A spotlight also
contains several mirrors which
amplify and aim the light. A
spotlight creates a 5-foot-wide
beam of normal light, which extends to a distance of 90 feet
and continues for another 90 feet as dim light. It does not
radiate any light outside the area of the beam. A spotlight does
not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A
lantern burns for 1 hour on 1 pint of oil, and requires two hands
to move and one hand to aim.
