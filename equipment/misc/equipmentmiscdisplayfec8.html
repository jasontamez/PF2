Description

A small, elliptical metal case containing a small portrait or keepsake, a hypnotist's locket can be attached to a belt or worn as a pendant. When hanging from a metal chain, a hypnotist's locket grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks for the hypnotism occult skill unlock.

A hypnotist's locket can also come in the form of a pocket watch. It can be worn the same way, still includes a space for a portrait or keepsake, and adds the same bonus for hypnotism, but it also functions as a timepiece.
