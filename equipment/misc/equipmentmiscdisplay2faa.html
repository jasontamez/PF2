Gather DC 20; Yield 1d4 doses
Terrain any plains or swamps
Preparation A bloody mandrake must be pulped so that its sticky red sap can be gathered, skimmed, and then refined into an even stickier paste; this process requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check and 1d4 hours of work per yield.
Use One dose of bloody mandrake paste smeared on the lips (this is a free action) during spellcasting can be used as an additional material component when casting spells that remove afflictions and conditions or that provide a morale bonus. Doing so grants a +1 bonus to the spell's effective caster level.

Description

Bloody mandrakes grow from the corpses of intelligent creatures who had supernatural powers in life. This plant's unsettlingly humanoid-shaped tuber-like roots increase fertility and vitality.
