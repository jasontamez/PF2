Description

A ventriloquist's dummy is made of finely sculpted and painted wood, shaped and dressed like a typical humanoid, and sized at roughly 2 feet. An insert in the back of the dummy allows a Small or Medium creature to manipulate it with one arm. When used as part of a routine, a ventriloquist's dummy adds a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform (comedy) checks.
