Description

This volume made quite a stir upon its release because it includes a good hundred pages of collected notes by famed Pathfinder Durvin Gest-who had disappeared over a century earlier. Many of these scraps recount only partial tales of danger and battle with little context, though one surprisingly complete chapter describes Gest's journey to the Crown of the World and his discoveries there. The portion of the book not consisting of Gest's notes features a treatise on negating the effects of magical traps by contemporary Mistress of Scrolls Andirissa Belathax.
