Description

These arrows are tightly wrapped in strands of alchemical glue. Durable arrows don't break with normal use, whether or not they hit their target; unless a durable arrow goes missing, an archer can retrieve and reuse it again and again. Durable arrows can be broken in other ways (such as deliberate snapping, hitting a fire elemental, and so on). A magical durable arrow with an enhancement bonus or magic weapon special ability applies these magical effects only the first time it is used-afterward, the durable arrow becomes nonmagical, and it can be reused or imbued with magic again.
