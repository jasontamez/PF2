Description

This glass vial contains alchemically preserved musk from a single variety of creature. Sniffing bottled musk provides a +4 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to track creatures of the same variety by scent. Additionally, bottled musk can be used as an additional spell component for the following spells to modify the spell's effects.

Detect undead: Functions as written, but detects creatures of the musk's associated creature type.

Locate creature: Detects the same variety of creature as the musk (for example, using bison musk detects only bison, not all herd animals or animals), and provides a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome nondetection.
