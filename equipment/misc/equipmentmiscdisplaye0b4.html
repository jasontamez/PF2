Description

A quick-pack table is a piece of lightweight furniture designed to be both portable and versatile. Street-corner hawkers commonly use such tables to display small goods for sale.

A quick-pack table can be set up in a relatively small area and usually takes up a few square feet. When opened, the table has four legs and a flat top surface, along with a bookcase-style upright display where items such as jewelry can be exhibited. When necessary, the table and its contents can be closed, folded up, and collapsed in a single round, with all the goods safely held in their respective compartments. The owner can carry the folded table under one arm.
