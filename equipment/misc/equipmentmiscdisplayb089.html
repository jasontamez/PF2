Description

This kit for a heavy wagon includes specialized boxes and pots for growing a wide range of plants, in addition to space for a couple of animals, such as goats, and their feed. A traveling garden provides food and healing herbs. It functions similar to a healer's kit, providing up to five uses per day, and is never exhausted. In addition, those who ingest a daily variety of fresh herbs and vegetables from the garden gain a +1 bonus on saving throws against disease.
