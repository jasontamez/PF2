Description

One end of this short length of petrified wood burns with a flame of ever-changing hue, a tiny portion of the fires of the Founder's Flame (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Magnimar, City of Monuments 32). It provides light as per a normal torch but is not consumed, and its fire cannot be extinguished by mundane means (though total immersion temporarily quenches the flame). The torch can be wielded as an improvised light mace that deals an additional 1d2 points of fire damage; in addition, a creature damaged by the torch's fire takes a -1 penalty on saving throws for 1 round against effects that deal fire damage.
