Description

This is a straw-stuffed wire frame of a monstrous creature, wrapped in burlap and coated in the musk of that particular creature. When using the Handle Animal skill to teach the attack trick, having a monster dummy present allows the trainer to add whatever creature type the dummy represents to the list of creatures the animal will attack. The dummy also provides a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks to teach animals to attack all kinds of creatures.
