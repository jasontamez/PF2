Description

This book appears to be the holy text of a particular religion, but it is actually a subtly encoded version of the text of an entirely different faith. Such tomes allow the faithful to keep copies of their holy texts hidden in plain sight-especially when those tomes are outlawed or stigmatized. A creature reading a disguised holy text can notice the irregularities of the text with a successful DC 18 Linguistics check; if the result of this check is 25 or higher, the creature cracks the text's cipher and understands its true meaning. A follower of a disguised holy text's true faith gains a +5 bonus on her Linguistics check to decipher the tome. The typical disguised holy text is of average quality, costs 25 gp, and weighs 2 pounds; cheaper or more extravagant versions are available with varying costs and weights.
