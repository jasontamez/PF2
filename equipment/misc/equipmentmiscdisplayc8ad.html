Description

Clerics of Desna claim that the Great Dreamer planted the first seed of this flower with her own hand. When the orange petals are cured and left to steep in hot water, the leaves of Desna's star make a mild, aromatic tea that facilitates restful sleep. When taken before sleeping, this tea grants the drinker the benefits of a full 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep in only 6 hours. One dose of Desna's star makes enough tea to serve six.
