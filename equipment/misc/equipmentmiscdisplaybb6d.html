Description

The skydragon firework is the apex of the firework artisan's craft. Unlit, a skydragon firework looks like an unassuming tube of thin wood and colored parchment. One round after you light a skydragon firework, the tube takes flight at a speed of 60 feet for 1d4 rounds, traveling in the direction it is pointed for the first round and changing direction randomly each round thereafter. The firework deals 2d6 points of fire damage to any creature within 10 feet of its flight path. If a skydragon's flight path causes it to hit a solid object, the firework continues in a random direction but subtracts 30 feet from its movement for that round.
