Description

Sentry seeds are small, hollow, ovoid glass beads with flat sides. A specially crafted pouch, containing enough seeds to fill eight 5-foot squares, allows the user to evenly scatter these seeds across any flat, hard, mostly level surface. When stepped upon, the glass beads break with audible pops (Perception DC 10), warning of potential intruders. Although they are easy to see in the light (Perception DC 10), sentry seeds are difficult to spot in dim light or darkness (Perception DC 20).
