Description

An efreeti switch is the activation device for efreeti cord; it measures approximately 6 inches in length and is made of a supple, red-brown alchemical compound. It is not consumed when activating a length of cord, and it can be used with any length of efreeti cord. It's possible to key lengths of efreeti cord to a specific switch; however, this doubles the price of both the efreeti cord and the switch.
