Description

This exclusive perfume is produced using dragon musk, which is integral to draconic mating rituals. Dragon musk is secreted in dragons' oil glands, and harvesting it is a very delicate procedure. Though only mildly fragrant, dragon musk can elicit a variety of effects when added to perfume. The effect depends largely on the other ingredients in the perfume, but a single application of draconic perfume lasts only 1 hour, regardless of its specific properties. Some of the more common additives are listed below.

Rosewood and myrrh: This concoction is an aphrodisiac, and any creature wearing this perfume gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks and increases the DCs of any charm subschool spells cast during this time by 2.

Sage, bergamot, and cedar ash: This pungent aroma has an imposing effect. Any creature wearing this perfume gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and does not take any penalties for attempting to Intimidate a larger opponent.

Sulfur and honeycomb: This aroma is sometimes called -Hell's Smell.- Any creature wearing this scent gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks and increases the DC of any compulsion subschool spells cast during this time by 2.

Each vial of draconic perfume contains 1 application of the scent. Producing draconic perfume requires 1 vial of musk, the Dragoncrafting feat, and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
