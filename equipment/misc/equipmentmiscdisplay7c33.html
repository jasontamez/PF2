Description

This clay container resembles a fuse grenade, but trails a pulley and wire rather than a fuse. Pulling the cord (a move action) sparks a flint and steel within the device, causing the grenade to explode. The pull cord can be attached to a door or drawer within 5 feet, or strung across a 5-foot square, causing the grenade to detonate when its tripwire is disturbed. A pull-cord grenade cannot be reused.

This can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check.
