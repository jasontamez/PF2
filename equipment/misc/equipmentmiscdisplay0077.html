Description

Swallowing this pale green tea pill causes your blood to slow and chill, allowing you to ignore the first 20 points of bleed damage you take during the following 8 hours. In addition, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against fire effects during this time. However, you take a -2 penalty on initiative checks. Swallowing a blood-boiling pill while under the effects of a blood-chilling pill negates the effects of both pills.
