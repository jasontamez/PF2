Description

This fine gray powder causes targets to suffer from
uncontrollable itching until they spend at least 1 round
washing it off. Throwing a packet of itching powder is a splash
attack with a range increment of 10 feet. Anyone standing on
the square of impact must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save
to resist the powder, while those in adjacent squares must
make a DC 8 Fortitude save. Creatures that fail the save take
a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and
ability checks until they wash the powder off. This is a poison
effect. Crafting this item is a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
