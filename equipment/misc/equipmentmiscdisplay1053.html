Description

These Tiny birds of prey are mainly nocturnal and are known for their keen eyes and near-silent flight. Owls eat small animals and insects, and can be found in nearly any environment. Some farmers create owl homes near fields and barns to control rodent populations. The smartest owls make excellent familiars. More information on owls can be found in the Bestiary.
