Description

This small box is covered with varying gears, locks, panels, and other mechanisms. Thieves practice their mechanical skills by attempting to undo or unlock the various mechanisms to reach the box's center. The mechanisms shift and rearrange, allowing for a multitude of combinations to keep the box from opening. Once unlocked, the box resets itself and provides a reordered set of mechanisms, starting the process over. Using a thief trainer to improve your skills requires 1 hour and a DC 25 Disable Device check. If you succeed at the check, you reduce the time required to complete a Disable Device check by 2 rounds (minimum 1 round). This bonus lasts for 24 hours.
