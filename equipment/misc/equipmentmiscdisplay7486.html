Description

The tiny compartment in the thick bottom of this cup is an excellent place to store a small item or substance. The most insidious are designed with a weighted catch that opens when the cup is tilted back, releasing the hidden substance into the contents of the cup. Spotting the secret compartment in an empty cup requires a DC 15 Perception check.
