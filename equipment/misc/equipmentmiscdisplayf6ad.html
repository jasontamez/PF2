Description

A concealment coin appears in all respects like a typical coin of the realm and is often crafted from an ordinary coin-though for soft metals like gold, the coin is typically made with an iron or steel interior and then plated with the more valuable metal. Twisting the coin along its edge unscrews the two halves, revealing a thin, hollow space inside. Such coins are often used to hide small messages written on very fine paper for covert delivery. Noticing a concealment coin's true nature requires a successful DC 25 Perception check.
