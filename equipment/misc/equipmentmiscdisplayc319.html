Description

An alchemist with an alchemy crafting kit is assumed to have all the material components needed for his extracts, mutagens, and bombs, except for those components that have a specific cost. An alchemy crafting kit provides no bonuses on Craft (alchemy) checks. (This item was called an "alchemist's kit" in the Advanced Player's Guide, and was renamed to avoid confusion with this book's pre-selected set of adventuring gear called an "alchemist's kit.")
