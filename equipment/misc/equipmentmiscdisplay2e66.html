Description

Subversive vests are tailored to the pinnacle of courtly fashion, yet have strategically placed compartments for hiding thieves' tools. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal thieves' tools within a subversive vest.

A subversive vestment is like a subversive vest, but resembles a clerical vestment and has a greater carrying capacity. In addition to thieves' tools, you can stow two 1-pint flasks in specially designed pockets that conceal the items' bulk from common view, with the same circumstance bonus as a subversive vest.
