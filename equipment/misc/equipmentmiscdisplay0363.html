Description

These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from standard manacles upon inspection (Perception DC 25). A wearer who knows the location of the secret catch can open them as a standard action; otherwise they act like masterwork manacles. Some appear to be of common quality, though false manacles are always masterwork.
