Description

This silvery liquid amplifies magical energies. For 1 hour after drinking this tincture, treat your caster level as 2 higher for the purpose of determining spells' durations and ranges. The liquid unsettles the stomach, imposing a -1 penalty on Fortitude and Reflex saves for the same duration. Whenever you fail a Fortitude or Reflex save while under these effects, you must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated for 1 round.
