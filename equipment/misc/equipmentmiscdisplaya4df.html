Description

This compact trampoline comes apart and rolls up like a tent for easy transport. Setting up or taking apart the trampoline takes 1 minute. When operated by two creatures, the collapsible trampoline confers a +5 bonus on all Acrobatics checks made to jump. If a falling creature lands on the trampoline, it ignores the first 10 feet of falling damage.
