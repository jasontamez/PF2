Description

This oily solution draws water out of living creatures (especially amorphous creatures), simultaneously dehydrating them and drenching their surfaces with a slick, sickly cold sweat. Desiccating lubricant can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A living creature struck by a direct hit from desiccating lubricant takes 1d4 points of nonlethal damage; a -2 penalty on combat maneuver checks to grapple, bull rush, or disarm; and a -2 penalty to CMD against grapple, bull rush, and disarm checks. These penalties last 1 minute. Against ooze creatures and creatures with the water subtype, desiccating lubricant deals 2d4 points of lethal damage and the penalties increase to -4.
