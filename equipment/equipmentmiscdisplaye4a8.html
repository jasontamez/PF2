Description

This simple iron amulet is in the shape of an eye within a helm. It must be worn in plain sight to have any effect. When activated, an iron eye allows its wielder to expend its power to gain a sacred (if activated with positive energy) or profane (if activated with negative energy) bonus on her next Intimidate check. This bonus is equal to the number of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The amulet remains charged until its magic is used or 1 hour passes.
