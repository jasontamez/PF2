Description

Also known as deadly nightshade, this plant, with its distinctive greenish-purple leaves and dull black berries, has served as a cosmetic and medicine for longer than memory despite its toxicity. It can also induce vivid but usually unpleasant hallucinations, particularly ones dealing with flight. Herbalists and others trained to use it safely believe it has numerous applications, including pain relief.
