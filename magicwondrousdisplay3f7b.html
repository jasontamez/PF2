Description

This rolled cloth resembles a rug or sheet. If the cloth is unfurled on a flat horizontal surface and its command word spoken as a standard action, its 10-foot-by-10-foot surface changes to match the coloration of the surrounding ground. The next time a Small or larger creature walks over the portable pit, it transforms into an extradimensional chasm at least 20 feet deep. Creatures that trigger this effect and those adjacent to the portable pit when it transforms must succeed a DC 20 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking damage and suffering additional effects (see below). The extradimensional pit persists for 1 minute before collapsing (harmlessly expelling any trapped creatures into an adjacent space) and becoming inert for 24 hours. If the command word is spoken a second time, a portable pit transforms back into cloth and can be picked up, moved, or stored.

Creatures notice a concealed portable pit with a successful DC 20 Perception check. Those trapped within can attempt to climb out; the Climb DC for the pit's smooth walls is 20.

Acid Pit: Woven from green and yellow fabric, a portable acid pit drops victims 30 feet into a pool of boiling acid. The fall deals 2d6 points of damage and an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, while the acid deals 2d6 points of acid damage every round. The film of slick acid coating the pit walls imposes a -10 circumstance penalty on Climb checks. Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, acid pit.

Blunt Pit: Created in a spiraling weave of blue and brown wool, a portable blunt pit drops the victim 20 feet onto hard-packed earth, and the victim takes 2d6 points of damage from the fall. Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, create pit.

Hungry Pit: Spun from blood-red silk and studded with tiny teeth, a portable hungry pit transforms into a 40-foot-deep pit, dealing 4d6 points of damage to any victims who fall into it. Its ravenous walls then begin to grind like the stomach of a massive beast, dealing 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage every round to any creature in the pit. The convulsing walls impose a -15 circumstance penalty on Climb checks. Moderate conjuration; CL 9th; Craft Wondrous Item, hungry pit.

Persistent Pit: This pit drops victims 20 feet, dealing 2d6 points of damage, and resumes its disguised form (expelling anyone trapped within) after 1 minute like other portable pits, but doesn't become inert once activated. A portable persistent pit continues to activate whenever a new creature walks across it. Faint conjuration; CL 4th; Craft Wondrous Item, create pit. Spiked Pit: A portable spiked pit is woven from cotton fibers and thorns. Once activated, it drops victims 20 feet onto a bed of spikes. Each victim takes 2d6 points of damage from the fall, and lands on 1d4 spikes (Atk +10, 1d4+2 damage each). Faint conjuration; CL 5th; Craft Wondrous Item, spiked pit.
