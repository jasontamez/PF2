Description

A smaller version of the bullseye lantern, a miner's lantern provides normal light in a 30- foot cone and increases the light level by one step in the area beyond that, out to a 60-foot cone (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A miner's lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. It burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. A miner's lantern comes with straps for attachment to a helmet or other piece of sturdy headgear, but it can also be carried in one hand.
