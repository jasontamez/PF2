Description

This spell renders a touched object waterproof for the duration of the spell. The object must be no larger than 10 pounds per caster level. The spell protects the object from any mundane liquids (such as alcohol or oil) but not from magically created liquids. If this spell is cast on a creature, all of that creature's equipment is rendered waterproof as long as it is carried by the target creature. If the creature drops or discards an item, the item is no longer protected by this spell, even if the targeted creature picks it up later.

Mundane combustibles under the effects of this spell still need exposure to air in order to ignite.
