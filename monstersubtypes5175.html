Clockworks are constructs created through a fusion of magic and technology. A clockwork has the following traits unless otherwise noted. <ul><li>Difficult to Create (Ex): The time and gp cost required to create a clockwork is 150% of normal. Construction requirements in individual clockwork monster entries are already increased. </li><li>Swift Reactions (Ex): Clockwork constructs generally react much more swiftly than other constructs. They gain <a href="featdisplay9c1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Initiative">Improved Initiative</a> and <a href="featdisplay7b12.html?ItemName=Lightning%20Reflexes">Lightning Reflexes</a> as bonus feats, and they gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. </li><li>Vulnerable to Electricity: Clockwork constructs take half again as much damage (+50%) from electricity attacks. </li><li>Winding (Ex): Clockwork constructs must be wound with special keys in order to function. As a general rule, a fully wound clockwork can remain active for 1 day per Hit Die, but shorter or longer durations are possible.</li></ul>
