Description

This humble pad of woven river reeds allows its owner
to recover his mental fortitude and ki pool by practicing
breathing exercises and other forms of meditation. Each
hour its owner spends sitting on the mat without taking any
other action, he can attempt to center himself by making a
Wisdom check with a DC of 10 + the monk's current number
of ki points (note that ability checks, like skill checks, do not
automatically succeed on a 20). If the check is successful, the
monk regains 1 ki point.
