Many taverns, and certainly most inns, offer food to their customers. As with drinks, menus typically consist of local fare, although more upscale restaurants, particularly those in urban settings, may offer food from farther away-ranging from mildly unusual dishes from the barony a few leagues away to exotic dishes from the farthest reaches of the globe. See the <a href="equipmentmisc7363.html?Category=FoodDrink">Food/Drink equipment section</a> for different types of common meals and their prices.

Offering exotic or bizarre food on a menu is another great way to make a tavern or inn more memorable. The players will quickly forget the tavern that just serves mutton, but they will probably remember the inn that serves poached drake eggs in firebrandy sauce.
