Description

This slender tube contains an acrid black sludge that feels warm to the touch. When she consumes this elixir, the imbiber is transformed into a gray cat for 1 hour (as beast shape II), leaving behind any worn belongings on the ground. While under the effects of the elixir, the imbiber gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet, and her paw prints leave a trail of scorch marks that smell faintly of sulfur. If the imbiber's original form already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. When the effect ends, the imbiber transforms back into her original form.
