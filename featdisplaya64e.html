You have enough control over your transformations that you can lash out at an opponent while assuming your alternate form.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2310.html?ItemName=Shapeshifter%20Style">Shapeshifter Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayb185.html?ItemName=Shapeshifter%20Twist">Shapeshifter Twist</a>, base attack bonus +8, change shape ability, shapechanger subtype.

Benefit: While you are using <a href="featdisplay2310.html?ItemName=Shapeshifter%20Style">Shapeshifter Style</a>, if you use your change shape or wild shape ability as a standard action, you can also make a single melee attack with one of your natural weapons at your highest base attack bonus against one foe within your reach.

Special: A character with the wild shape class feature counts as having the change shape ability and shapechanger subtype for the purpose of meeting this feat's prerequisites.
