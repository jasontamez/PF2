Your magical connection to nature allows you to entice, fool, and misdirect plants and fungi as though they were people.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (enchantment)</a>, Knowledge (nature) 6 ranks.

Benefit: A verdant spell affects plant creatures (even mindless plant creatures) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but it has no effect on other types of creatures. A verdant spell uses up a spell slot 2 levels higher than the spell's actual level. This feat works only on mind-affecting spells.

Normal: Creatures of the plant type are immune to mind-affecting effects.
