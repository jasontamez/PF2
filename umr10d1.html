The creature perfectly imitates certain sounds or even specific voices. The creature attempts a Bluff check opposed by the listener's Sense Motive check to recognize the mimicry, although if the listener isn't familiar with the person or type of creatures mimicked, it takes a -8 penalty on its Sense Motive check. The creature has a +8 racial bonus on its Bluff check to mimic sounds (including accents and speech patterns, if a voice mimic) it has listened to for at least 10 minutes. The creature cannot duplicate the effects of magical abilities (such as <a href="classdisplayaec9.html?ItemName=Bard">bardic performance</a> or a <a href="monsterdisplaycaac.html?ItemName=Harpy">harpy's captivating song</a>), though it may be able to mimic the sound of those abilities. This ability does not allow the creature to speak or understand languages it doesn't know.
