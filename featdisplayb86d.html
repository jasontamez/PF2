By deepening your connection with your coven members, you have made your coven capable of casting more spells each day.

Prerequisites: Changeling, coven hex or Coven-Touched.

Benefit: Your changeling coven can cast three more spells each day from its list of spell-like abilities. If multiple members of your coven take this feat, the benefits stack.
