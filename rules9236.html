The creator or controller of a mindscape determines whether gravity exists in that mindscape, and if it does, how strongly it exerts its pull.

Normal Gravity: Gravity functions just as it does on the Material Plane.

Light Gravity: Gravity's effect is reduced, and creatures can jump, fly, and lift heavy objects with less effort.

Heavy Gravity: Gravity's effect is increased, and creatures find that jumping, flying, and lifting objects require more exertion.

No Gravity: Gravity does not exist, and objects float in space wherever they are in relation to one another, unless they're set in motion by someone, in which case they travel in a straight line at a constant rate of speed until they collide with another object or a creature somehow changes their motion.

Subjective Gravity: Gravity functions however each individual wishes it, relative to that individual. Thus, if one creature stands on the floor of a parlor, while another envisions the ceiling of that same room as being "down" and stands upon that surface, each would experience gravity differently and see the other as "overhead" and "down"
