You can infuse your kinetic blast with poison. To use this infusion, you must be holding a dose of poison or have at least one use of a feat or racial trait that produces poison (such as the <a href="featdisplaya9c9.html?ItemName=Spit%20Venom">Spit Venom</a> feat or the <a href="racesdisplaye905.html?ItemName=Grippli">toxic skin grippli alternate racial trait</a>). One dose of poison or one use of your feat or racial trait is consumed if applicable, and creatures damaged by the infused blast are affected by the poison. Use the same type, save, save DC, frequency, effect, and cure as the consumed poison.
