Tactics

Before Combat The wizard casts darkvision, endure elements, mage armor, nondetection, resist energy (electricity, fire), see invisibility, and spell turning.
During Combat The wizard uses tactics specific to his quarry, choosing spells with saving throws that target his prey's weakest defenses. When facing a target he knows little about, he casts greater invisibility and then enlarged black tentacles to give him time to find the perfect spell. Against single targets, he casts disintegrate, enlarged maximized scorching ray, or maximized magic missile. He uses telekinesis to hurl boulders if the kill is supposed to look like an accident.
Base Statistics Without darkvision, mage armor, resist energy (electricity, fire), and see invisibility, the wizard's statistics are AC 17, touch 16, flat-footed 13; Senses low-light vision; Defensive Abilities none; Resist none.

The mage sniper kills with spells at extreme range.

Hiroki Darshan

Hiroki is a lethal sniper. He hunts only lawbreakers and rabble-rousers, and is insulted when called an assassin. His magic allows him to kill or capture dangerous people who evade or overcome common soldiers, but he considers preparation his greatest weapon.

Combat Encounters: Hiroki might target a PC who has broken a law or reneged on an oath. He usually sets an ambush, possibly aided by other mercenaries, in an area he has studied carefully.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Hiroki sells his services as long-range spellcasting support, though he must be convinced the purpose is legal and serves the cause of justice.
