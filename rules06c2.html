A character who chooses <a href="classdisplay3fa3.html?ItemName=Wizard">wizard</a> as his secondary class gains the following secondary class features.

School: At 1st level, he chooses a <a href="wizardschools.html">school of magic</a> in which to specialize. For all powers of that school, he treats his character level as his effective wizard level.

Familiar: At 3rd level, he gains a <a href="classdisplay477d.html?ItemName=Familiar">familiar</a>, treating his character level as his effective wizard level.

School Power: At 7th level, he gains the 1st-level powers of his chosen school. If any of those powers grant an extra effect at 20th level, the character does not gain that extra effect.

Cantrip: At 11th level, if he has an Intelligence score of 10 or higher, he chooses a wizard cantrip from his chosen school and can cast that cantrip as a spell-like ability at will. He uses his character level as the caster level and Intelligence as the cantrip's key ability score.

Discovery: At 15th level, he gains an <a href="wizardarcanediscoveries.html">arcane discovery</a> or wizard bonus feat, treating his character level as his effective wizard level.

Greater School Power: At 19th level, he gains the 8th-level power of his chosen school.
