Cunning and manipulative, these dragon disciples trap their foes with schemes and spells before showering them with deadly acid.

Remel Levath

Remel Levath has always craved control. She's certain that if people just did what she wanted them to, there would be peace and order-for her, at least. When the petty motivations and stupid behaviors of the "rabble" get in the way, she has no choice but to magically manipulate them into doing the "right" thing. If they still don't, she unleashes her righteous fury in a spray of purifying acid.

Combat Encounters: Remel sees all altercations as the fault of the other parties, and tends to shout her disappointment throughout the battle, encouraging them to lay down their arms-though not all who surrender receive mercy.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Always arrogant and often argumentative, Remel employs enchantment spells even in casual conversation. Despite her prejudices, she knows that she needs like-minded individuals to aid in enforcing her will. She can be surprisingly flattering and friendly toward those with the good sense to follow her directions in all things.
