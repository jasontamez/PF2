You seek new applications for magical energy.


Prerequisites: You must have created a new spell, or
have The Way Things Work background.

Benefit:  When casting a spell you've created, add 1 to
your caster level. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on
Spellcraft checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in
Spellcraft, this bonus increases to +4.


Goal:  Create a new spell of at least 6th level.


Completion Benefit:  The save DCs for any
spells you create increase by 1 when you cast them.
In addition, when applying metamagic feats
to self-created spells, reduce the total level
adjustment by 1. You can't reduce metamagic
costs to lower than the spell's original level in this manner.


Special:  For a self-created spell to benefit from this
feat, it must be a truly novel spell. Spells slightly altered
from the original (for example, delayed blast fireball as
compared to fireball) gain no benefit. Alchemists can
benef it from this feat as though their formulae and
extracts were spells.
