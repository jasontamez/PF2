Strength Normal
The arcanist can open her eye of the Arclord one additional time each day by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir. She can gain more uses, but each subsequent use costs 1 additional point from her reservoir (2 points for the second additional use, 3 points for the third use, and so on). The arcanist must have the <a href="featdisplay7caa.html?ItemName=Eye%20of%20the%20Arclord">Eye of the Arclord</a> feat to select this exploit.
