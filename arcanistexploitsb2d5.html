Strength Normal
The arcanist can unleash a lance of lightning by expending 1 point from her arcane reservoir and making a ranged touch attack against any one target within 30 feet. If the attack hits, it deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, plus 1d6 points of electricity damage for every 2 levels beyond 1st (to a maximum of 10d6 at 19th level). The target's vision is also impaired, causing the target to treat all creatures as if they had concealment (20%) for 1 round. It can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to negate the impaired vision.
