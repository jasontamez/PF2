Description

These husky, shaggy beasts are sometimes domesticated as pack animals in the Crown of the World. Their statistics are identical to aurochs (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 174), but they are immune to cold weather effects (though not severe cold and extreme cold effects). Domesticated musk oxen have the docile special quality (see horse; Bestiary 177), and treat their gore attack as a secondary natural weapon. In the polar rim mountains of Tian Xia, yaks are used as pack animals and have identical statistics.
