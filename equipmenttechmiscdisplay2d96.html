Description

A skillchip contains a wealth of knowledge and lore concerning a single skill. Skillchips for skills like Craft, Knowledge, Perform, and Profession that have multiple subcategories each encode only one subcategory; a user can have a Knowledge (engineering) skillchip, but there are no general Knowledge or Craft skillchips. In order for a user to access a skillchip's lore, it must be inserted into an active skillslot (see page 38).

The magnitude of the bonus granted by a skillchip varies, ranging from a +2 enhancement bonus to a +10 enhancement bonus, as summarized on the following table.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Model</td><td>Bonus</td></tr> <tr><td>Mark I</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Mark II</td><td>+4</td></tr> <tr><td>Mark III</td><td>+6</td></tr> <tr><td>Mark IV</td><td>+8</td></tr> <tr><td>Mark V</td><td>+10</td></tr></table>
