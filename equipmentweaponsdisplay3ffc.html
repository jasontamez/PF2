Description

A brutally weighted weapon is balanced to put more weight on the striking surface, knocking targets off balance with every blow. Only bludgeoning melee weapons can be brutally weighted. This modification can be added to a greatclub or tetsubo without increasing its weapon's category, but doing so increases the cost of modification by an additional 1,500 gp. A creature hit with a brutally weighted weapon takes a -2 penalty to its CMD against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers until the end of its next turn or until after it is subject to such a maneuver (whichever comes first).
