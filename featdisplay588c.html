Having seen the wonders of the world, you know how to tweak more chaos out of a rod of wonder.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, Wonderseeker faction, gnome.

Benefit: When you activate a rod of wonder, roll d% to determine what effect the rod would create. If you desire to do so, you can roll d% again and use this second result. You can only use this ability once per round.
