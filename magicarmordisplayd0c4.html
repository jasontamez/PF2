Description

This special ability can be placed only on a shield. Once per day, a singing shield's bearer can command the shield to sing for 10 rounds to counter magical effects that depend on sound (as the bard's countersong ability). Once per round during this time, the shield's bearer can roll 1d20+10, treating that as the result of the shield's Perform check for countersong.
