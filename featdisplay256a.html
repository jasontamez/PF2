Shamed (Story)

A past humiliation haunts you to this day.


Prerequisites: You must have been publicly embarrassed, or must have the Bastard Born background. If the
embarrassment didn't cause significant harm to your
personal honor or social standing, it does not qualify for
the feat prerequisites. The humiliation doesn't need to
have been unjustified.

Benefit:  Being observed drives you to excel. When
you're in a conflict that is being observed by others not
involved in the conflict, you gain a +1 bonus on attack
rolls and skill checks.


Goal:  You can complete this goal in one of two
fashions. First, thwart a chosen foe in a fashion that
clearly establishes your superiority to the general public.
Second, prove your worth another way, like gaining a title
or becoming the chosen hero of a region.


Completion Benefit:  Your newfound confidence gives
you temporary hit points equal to your character level.
These temporary hit points last until lost and refresh any
time you rest long enough for natural healing to occur (Core
Rulebook 191), whether or not any healing actually occurs.
