Even your healing is seductive.

Prerequisites: Channel positive energy class feature, worshiper of Calistria.

Benefit:  When you channel positive energy, those you heal can choose to take additional healing equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1), but in return they take a -2 penalty on Will saves against your charms, compulsions, and emotion effects and on Sense Motive checks against your Bluff checks. This penalty lasts for 24 hours. A creature cannot benefit from this feat again for the duration of this penalty.
