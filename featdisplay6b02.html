Stronghold - Feats







Stronghold (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8x64?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Campaign">Ultimate Campaign pg. 72</a>
You seek to build a bastion against which your enemies
shall break like water against the rocks.


Prerequisites: You must have the Leadership feat and
must lead at least 10 combat-capable followers (such as
fighters or rangers).

Benefit:  You can spend a move action to give battle
orders to your troops, granting creatures under your
command within 60 feet your choice of a +1 morale bonus
on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, or a +1 bonus on
a single type of saving throw. All creatures must receive
the same benefit. You can't use this benefit on allies not
under your command. This is a language-dependent,
mind-affecting effect.


Goal:  Build or capture a stronghold capable of housing
a force of at least 200 troops, and staff it with at least
100 combat-capable soldiers (or the equivalent) under
your command. You must also provide food and water
sufficient to survive at least a 6-month siege and a gold
reserve sufficient for at least 6 months of wages if your
troops require pay.


Completion Benefit:  Your battle order bonuses improve
to +2, and the range of your orders increases to 120 feet. In
addition, you can give two different orders to your troops.
For example, you could grant your archers +2 on attack
rolls while your front line gains a +2 bonus to AC.
