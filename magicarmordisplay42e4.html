Description

This jet-black uniform is assigned to top agents in Druma's military-the Mercenary League. Wearers of this +3 armored coat continually benefit from the spell undetectable alignment. When following the orders of a member of the Kalistocracy, the wearer receives a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saves, and skill checks related to completion of her mission.

Anytime the wearer tries to disregard an order given by a member of the Kalistocracy, she must attempt a Will save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the total Hit Dice of the creature giving the order. If she fails, she must follow the order to the best of her ability. If she succeeds, she can remove the armor as a move action to ignore the command.
