You can feed your body when you gather power.

Prerequisites: Gather power class feature, <a href="classdisplayc359.html?ItemName=Kineticist">kineticist level 8th</a>.

Benefit: When you gather power, instead of reducing the burn cost of a blast wild talent, you can send elemental energy flowing through your body to gain a +2 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution until the end of your turn for each point of burn reduction your gather power would grant (to a maximum of +10 when spending a full round plus a move action to gather power with the supercharge class feature).
