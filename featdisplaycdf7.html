Your adulation of death not only shields you from your fears, it allows you to feed on them.

Prerequisites: Wis 19, Deadhand Style-, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks, ki pool class feature, nongood alignment.

Benefit: While using Deadhand Style, as long as you have at least 1 point in your ki pool, your bonus on saving throws against fear effects increases to +4, and the DC of Intimidate checks attempted against you increases by 8.

Additionally, if an enemy targets you with a fear effect, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool as an immediate action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice your Hit Dice.
