The guildmaster manipulates crime and politics-often the same thing-to create wealth and stability for himself and his devoted thieves.

Olenjack the Axe

Olenjack worked his way up through the ranks of the guild he now runs with a patient but firm hand. He has always been unusually tall for a dwarf, and frequently jokes that he's used magic to make himself even taller. He is patient and deliberate, able to keep multiple schemes and long-term plans in mind simultaneously, and never forgets (or lets his acolytes forget) that as his dwarven lifespan is longer than that of his human enemies. He's often able to plan for the future, remain patient, and let his more brash enemies walk directly into the traps he's laid for them. His nickname refers to his habit of taking swift, decisive action after quiet planning, executing his will in one stroke. Yet despite his formidable nature, he's learned the value of spreading the wealth and not preying too heavily on locals. As a result, he remains a pillar of his community, highly respected even by those who suspect his criminal ties. Those living within his territory seek his advice and ask him for favors, most regarding him as a beneficent but firm grandfatherly figure without ever realizing his true hardhearted character.

Combat Encounters: Olenjack and his bodyguards might fight the PCs if a peaceful meeting goes terribly wrong, if the PCs betray him and he wants to personally teach them a lesson, or if they threaten the livelihood of his guild and have already proven themselves capable of overpowering his minions.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Given Olenjack's ties to the community, the PCs may interact with him in a king's court, at a meeting of mercantile guildmasters, or among the patrons of high society.
