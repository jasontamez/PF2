Description

This fist-sized cluster of aggressive fungus grows rapidly when placed against a solid surface and exposed to water, and can quietly bore a 5-foot-tall, 10-foot-deep tunnel in a straight line. The tunnel is supported by sturdy fungal tubes. A tunnel creeper cannot eat through metal or any material denser than common stone. A tunnel creeper takes 10 minutes to carve a tunnel through stone, or 5 minutes to carve through wood, after which the fungus withers and falls to the ground.
