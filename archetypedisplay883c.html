A nature fang is a druid who stalks and slays those who despoil nature, kill scarce animals, or introduce diseases to unprotected habitats. She gives up a close empathic connection with the natural world to become its deadly champion and avenger.

Studied Target (Ex):  At 1st level, a nature fang gains the slayer's studied target class feature. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the nature fang's bonus against her studied target increases by 1. Unlike a slayer, a nature fang does not gain the ability to maintain more than one studied target at the same time. This ability replaces nature sense, wild empathy, and woodland stride.

Slayer Talent:  At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a nature fang selects a slayer talent. Starting at 12th level, she can select an advanced slayer talent in place of a slayer talent. She uses her druid level as her slayer level to determine what talents she can select. This ability replaces wild shape.

Sneak Attack (Ex):  At 4th level, a nature fang gains sneak attack +1d6. This functions as the rogue sneak attack ability. If the nature fang gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Swift Studied Target:  At 9th level, a nature fang can study an opponent as a move or swift action. This ability replaces venom immunity.

Slayer Talents:  The following slayer talents complement the nature fang archetype: foil scrutiny, poison use, ranger combat style.
