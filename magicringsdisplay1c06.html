Description

This mithral ring is engraved with a pattern of rolling waves that encircles the entire band. The saltspray ring is immune to rust, both from natural oxidation and rust caused by magical effects.

Upon command, the ring causes a thick vapor to continuously surround its owner as per <a href="spelldisplay846a.html?ItemName=obscuring%20mist">obscuring mist</a>, except the mist has a 10-foot radius from the wearer and the area of effect moves with the wearer. This mist is exceedingly wet and extinguishes all nonmagical fires within its area. Magical fires and creatures with the fire subtype are not dispelled or adversely affected by the mist, though such creatures find being in the fog to be an uncomfortable experience. The mist does not permit aquatic creatures without the amphibious special quality to breathe out of water, but creatures that must remain wet or suffer a negative effect or condition have that requirement satisfied by the ring's effect. This effect can be dismissed as a standard action. The ring has no effect whatsoever underwater.
