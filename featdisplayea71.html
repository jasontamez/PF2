Beast Speaker Mastery

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 21</a>
Your magical beast has developed abilities that only its wild kin would normally have.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7a53.html?ItemName=Beast%20Speaker">Beast Speaker</a>, character level equal to or higher than that listed in your companion's mastery entry.

Benefit: Your beast companion gains the abilities and bonuses listed in the mastery entry in its stat block. You must be of at least the indicated level for the companion to use these abilities, so if you dismiss a companion and gain a new beast companion of a different type, you retain the feat but might not yet be of sufficient level for the new companion to gain its mastery benefits.

Normal: A beast companion is unable to use its mastery abilities regardless of its advancement.
