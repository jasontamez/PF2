Description

Often crafted by denizens of the First World, this pinecone shaped knot of briars can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The area within a 20-foot radius of where the briar bomb lands erupts with thick, thorny brambles (hardness 5, hp 15) that hinder creatures in the area. The briars extend to 20 feet high, so long as there is vertical space for this growth. The briars do not block vision, but they provide cover against attacks made through them.

A creature moving through the briars takes 1d4 points of piercing damage for every 5 feet of movement through the area. In addition, each creature trying to move through the briars must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or become entangled in place. Entangled creatures can break free of the briars as a full-round action with a successful DC 20 Strength check or Escape Artist check. A creature trapped in the briars can opt to remain motionless in order to avoid taking any more damage. A creature can try to pick its way slowly through a field of briars without taking damage or risking entanglement by attempting a Dexterity check as a full-round action. For every 5 points by which the result exceeds 10, the creature can move 5 feet (up to its normal speed).

Once a briar bomb is thrown, it is destroyed.
