Description

A portable hole is a circle of cloth spun
from the webs of a phase spider
interwoven with strands of ether and
beams of starlight, resulting in a
portable extradimensional space.
When opened fully, a portable hole is 6
feet in diameter, but it can be folded up
to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any
surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to
come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by
simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.
Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole
remains, traveling with the item.


The only air in the hole is that which enters when the
hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth
does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each
portable hole opens on its own particular nondimensional
space. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole,
a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag
and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a
portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a
gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures
within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the portable hole
and bag of holding being destroyed in the process.
