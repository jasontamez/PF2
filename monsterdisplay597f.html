Special Abilities

Dramatic Flourish (Su) As a standard action while its
impossible verisimilitude is active, a seilenos can inspire
strong emotions in all enemies, all allies, or all creatures
(seilenos's choice) within 120 feet that can hear or see it,
replicating the effect of a spell of the seilenos's choice:
charm monster, confusion, crushing despair, fear, good hope,
joyful rapture, reckless infatuation, suggestion, vengeful
outrage, or waves of ecstasy. A creature that successfully
saves against a seilenos's dramatic flourish can't be affected
by that seilenos's dramatic flourish again for 24 hours.
Any save DC is 30, regardless of which effect the seilenos
chooses. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Grace (Su) A seilenos gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to
his Charisma bonus (minimum +1).
Impossible Verisimilitude (Su) As a standard action, a
seilenos can begin telling a story so supernaturally vivid that
the elements described spring to life, replicating the effect
of a spell of the seilenos's choice: screen, shades (can also
mimic summon nature's ally VIII), or veil. It must use a free
action to continue the performance each round; if it doesn't,
the illusion immediately ends. As part of this free action,
the seilenos can add, remove, or change one illusion effect
each round, to a maximum of three simultaneous illusions.
Any save DC is 30, regardless of which effect the seilenos
chooses. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Sustaining Joy (Su) As long as it is within 60 feet of one or
more other creatures that have a morale bonus or are under
a harmless effect with the emotion descriptor, the seilenos
gains regeneration 15.
Thyrsus (Su) Any weapon a seilenos wields functions as a +5
weapon. Whenever the seilenos strikes a foe with a weapon,
he can spend a swift action to use a spell-like ability of 6th
level or lower that can target that foe. Only the creature
struck can be affected by the spell-like ability.
Versatile Performance (Ex) A seilenos can use versatile
performance as a 20th-level bard, using the chosen
Perform modifier for checks with the corresponding skills.

Description

Elder kin to satyrs, seilenoi are primeval fey bound to the
basest emotions, including lust, joy, surprise, aggression,
and fear. These fey wander the world, indulging in any
excuse to experience or inspire passionate feelings.
New spectacles of beauty, physical adventure, and
psychoactive plants and alcohol draw their attention, and
they encourage creatures they encounter to be equally
experimental. Seilenoi particularly enjoy luring stodgy,
honorable, or self-important beings into grandiose acts
of foolishness or indulgence. Although less notorious
than satyrs for sexual exploits, seilenoi possess a rugged
animal magnetism and an appreciation for all sorts of
carnal pleasures. They are particularly renowned for
their insight and skill as storytellers and playwrights.

Like satyrs, seilenoi prefer to keep to untamed wilds
where they revel in the passionate emotions of the fey
and beasts that live, grow, and play there. Creatures of
the forest often f lock to seilenoi in small troupes or even
traveling courts. Satyrs, leanan sidhe, and muses (see
page 179) enjoy the artistry of a seilenos's storytelling.
Centaurs and maenads revere seilenoi for inspiring
irresistibly passionate, ecstatic rage. The seilenos acts
as a mercurial judge, jocular keeper of fey culture and
secrets, and sometimes self-centered celebrity to these
groups. Seilenoi traveling across the ocean often take on
ichthyocentaurs as seafaring guides and
honor guards. Most seilenoi get separated from their
courts eventually, either because their fey followers
move on to more sedate leaders or because the
seilenos feels stif led and drunkenly wanders off
in search of a change of pace.

Seilenoi who do not lead their own fey
courts sometimes serve as jesters, emissaries,
unpredictable generals, or companions for fey
lords, deities, or other mighty beings. Seilenoi
prove surprisingly dangerous on the battlefield,
as they dash about scattering scores of enemies with
every cutting joke and inspiring monologue. When
dealing with more numerous foes, they confound the
battlefield with seemingly natural barriers and illusory
sheets of roaring f lame. Others enjoy deflating the egos
of powerful fey (and, occasionally, mortals) with bitingly
insightful satire.

In their wanderings, seilenoi sometimes seek out new
kinds of indulgence and distraction among mortals, in
which case these fey generally prove themselves amiable,
though gruff. Seilenoi can charm almost anyone with
raucous affection or witty commentary. Those they can't
talk into joining the revelry, they generally ply with
alcohol or psychotropic plants to lower the inhibitions of
civilization and enable a freer expression of raw emotion.
Bored seilenoi occasionally take it upon themselves to
mentor mortals with exceptional self-awareness and
power. Sometimes they do so while disguised with
polymorph magic to avoid undue attention.

Seilenoi are passionate creatures, as thrilled
by the chance to have a drunken brawl with new
opponents as to explore the body of a new lover.
Usually, seilenoi view combat as a sort of hunting or
wrestling game, but if they recognize true hostility, they
become a terrifying force. A seilenos never faces combat
alone; it summons allies to distract foes if necessary and
hides an ever-shifting mirage arcana while rallying allies
and keeping foes off balance by manipulating their
emotions. Its illusions represent the natural elements
with which a seilenos is familiar, from fantastical mazes
of writhing vines to confusing clouds of spores. It is
particularly amused by exchanging the appearances of
enemies and allies. Seilenoi have also been known to
transform especially vexing foes into harmless animals
or useful plants.

Although their wide range of moods tends toward joy
and frivolity, all seilenoi at times indulge in the insidious
thrill of violence, hatred, or madness. When filled with
these dark passions, a seilenos might provoke a battle
among evenly matched friends to watch the tense contest
or dive headlong into the confused heart of a fray.

Seilenoi are about the same size and weight as male
humans, although they tend toward the heavier end of
that range.
