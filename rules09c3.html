Options are the main way to specialize your monster. They represent feats, universal monster rules, magic items, and all the other abilities a monster has at its disposal beyond its statistics. There are a large number of monster options to choose from, especially compared to the number of choices you make during the other steps of the simple monster creation process. Some are active abilities (such as those that give the monster a special attack), others adjust statistics (such as the power attack option, which has the same purpose as the <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a> feat), and still others grant conditional modifiers (such as combat casting's bonus to concentration checks). Unless specified otherwise, saving throw DCs in this section use the Ability DC from the monster's array, modified by the monster's grafts.

Look at the number of monster options you're supposed to choose based on the monster's array and grafts. You should have a list saying how many to pick of each category. When you pick an option, write down the option's name and effects. Adjust any statistics the option's entry tells you to. After you've selected all the monster options you're supposed to, look at the list carefully. Does the monster do everything it needs to do? Does it seem like it has too few or too many options? Using your best judgment, add or remove options as necessary.

Categories: Monster options are divided into four categories: combat, magic, social, and universal.

Combat options are the most numerous, and most monsters the PCs are meant to face in battle should have at least one combat option. These options are subdivided to make them easier to choose based on the monster's theme, though you can choose from any combat option subcategory. Decide whether the monster is primarily cunning, powerful, quick, or tough, and look in that subcategory first. These subcategories correspond roughly to physical ability scores' Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, respectively. One additional category, monstrous, lists options that are rarely appropriate for monsters of PC races, such as energy drain or regeneration.

Magic options benefit monsters that cast spells, and are typically useful only to those with the spellcaster array or the secondary magic universal monster option. They also include some options that mimic PC class features of a magical nature. These options are divided into the creature, offensive, support, and versatile subcategories.

Social options give a monster advantages in interactions with other creatures. These are divided into the inspiration and miscellaneous subcategories. The inspiration subcategory includes mostly effects that bolster morale or cause fear.

Universal options can be chosen as though they were listed in any category. This means you can use a combat, magic, social, or "any" option to take a universal option.

"Any" Options: When a graft or array tells you to choose "any" option, you can take an option from the combat, magic, social, or universal category.

Feats: If you're looking to replicate a certain feat, look for its name in Table 5-7. Note that many monster options use the same names as feats but have different mechanical effects. This is intentional. The power attack option adjusts the monster's statistics once, applying an effect similar to the <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a> feat, but making it simpler to use rather than having you choose each time the monster attacks. In a case like this, if you prefer to have the added complexity and flexibility, you can use the feat's rules instead.

Universal Monster Rules: As with feats, many of these options mimic but simplify universal monster rules. Other monster rules, such as senses, can be used as-is and aren't repeated in this chapter. See the sidebar on page 229 if you're looking for a specific universal monster rule.

Duplicate Options: Generally speaking, you can choose an ability more than once when it makes sense and is useful. For example, you might give a monster the extra attack option twice because it fights with two weapons, one of which is a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay6bb5.html?ItemName=Speed">speed</a> weapon. Use your best judgement to determine whether it's a good idea to do so.

Damage: Many options say to use the high or low attack or damage value from the monster's array. Use the values from the high or low weapon attack and damage columns, not the natural attack values (even if the option is more like a natural attack thematically). You can choose to use a lower value if the ability would deal too much damage otherwise.

Universal Monster Rules

Some options listed in this section grant a monster the use of a universal monster rule. Often these refer to the entry in the appropriate Bestiary volume, sometimes with notes on how to simplify the ability. When a universal monster rule is gained through this system, use the ability DC from the monster's array instead of calculating the DC by the formula listed in the rule's entry in the Bestiary.

If you want to give a particular universal monster rule to a monster, look for it in the lists below. Most universal monster rules that aren't appropriate for player races appear in the section of monstrous combat rules.

Simplified Rules

The following universal monster rules have been recreated as options in this system, typically to simplify them or give concrete values for numbers that aren't defined in the original universal monster rule.

These rules are: bleed, blood drain, breath weapon, channel resistance, constrict, damage reduction, disease, distraction, energy drain, engulf, fast healing, frightful presence, immunity, incorporeal, natural attacks, poison, poisonous blood, powerful charge, rake, regeneration, rend, rock throwing, sound mimicry, spell resistance, stench, telepathy, trample.

Substitutions

Some universal monster rules a re very s imilar to other combat options, but the combat options use a different name because they're meant to be easier to understand with a quick look. The following list describes these, and shows in parentheses the name of the monster option to use instead: ability drain (ability damage), all-around vision (unflankable), blood rage (rage), fear (fear aura/ fear attack), grab (improved combat maneuver), natural invisibility (constant invisibility), powerful blows (power attack), pull (repositioning attack), push (repositioning attack), resistance (energy resistance), rock catching (rock throwing), spell-like abilities (either the spellcaster array or the secondary magic universal option), summon (summon allies).

Unmodified Rules

Most universal monster rules not mentioned elsewhere in this sidebar can be used as written. Unless they have a major effect on the monster's combat abilities, it's not worth counting them against the suggested number of options the monster can take. Senses, for example, are not covered in this section, and can be used as-is without costing the monster any options. Assume that weaknesses (such as light blindness or vulnerabilities) also fall into this category and can be used unmodified.

Other universal rules that can be used without modification, but which should be counted against the monster's number of options are attach, burn, capsize, change shape, curse of lycanthropy, fast swallow, ferocity, fortification, gaze, pounce, web (using the monster's CR as its Hit Dice to determine the web's hit points), whirlwind.

Though these options are geared primarily toward combatants, consider giving every monster at least one combat option, unless you intend the monster to never fight in any battle.

<a href="rulesa981.html?Name=Magic%20Options&amp;Category=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options">Magic Options</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 235</a>
These options are primarily useful to spellcasters, though combatants and experts blessed with magic can take them.

<a href="rulesdb6e.html?Name=Social%20Options&amp;Category=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options">Social Options</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 238</a>
Monsters with the expert array are the most adept with social options, though a charming swashbuckler (combatant) or an inspiring priest (spellcaster) could also benefit from one.

A universal option can be taken in place of any option granted by an array or graft, regardless of the intended option type. These abilities are suitable for multiple arrays and roles.

Athletic: When attempting an Acrobatics, Climb, or Swim check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Flying Acumen: This monster gains hover (as the <a href="featdisplaye621.html?ItemName=Hover">monster feat</a>) and gains Fly as an additional master skill.

Magic Weapon: The monster uses a magic weapon. Choose one of the following benefits to apply to its attacks with that weapon.
Bane: +2d6 points of damage against creatures of a specified type.
Energy: +1d6 points of energy damage (choose one type).
Keen: Double critical threat range.
Returning: Weapon returns if thrown (thrown only).
Seeking: Negates miss chances (ranged only).
Vicious: +2d6 points of damage, and also deals 1d6 points of damage to the monster on a hit (melee only).

If the monster is CR 10 or higher, you can also choose from the following.
Aligned: +2d6 points of damage against creatures of a specified alignment (choose chaotic, evil, good, or lawful).
Energy Burst: +1d6 points of energy damage and an additional 1d10 points of damage on a critical hit (choose one type).

To imitate a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay590b.html?ItemName=SPEED">speed</a> or <a href="magicweaponsdisplay05ea.html?ItemName=Wounding">wounding</a> weapon, use extra attack or bleed, respectively, and apply them only to attacks with the weapon.

Potions: The monster has two <a href="spelldisplaye3d6.html?ItemName=cure%20light%20wounds">potions of cure light wounds</a>, which cure 1d8+1 hit points each. At CR 5, these are <a href="spelldisplayb58c.html?ItemName=cure%20moderate%20wounds">potions of cure moderate wounds</a> healing 2d8+3 hit points, and at CR 10 they're <a href="spelldisplayccb7.html?ItemName=cure%20serious%20wounds">potions of cure serious wounds</a> healing 3d8+5 hit points.

Save Boost: Increase the monster's saving throw bonuses by 1, or increase any one of its saving throw bonuses by 3.

Secondary Magic: Though this monster isn't primarily a spellcaster, it does have several spells or spell-like abilities. Choose any <a href="rulesba5c.html?Name=Step%206:%20Spells&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">spell list</a>. The monster can use each of that list's primary spells of its CR band once per day. This ability can also be used to give a spellcaster extra spell-like abilities to fit its monster type.

Summon Allies: This monster can attempt to summon monsters of the same creature type as itself as a full-round action. Choose either a creature of the same CR as the monster (with a 35% chance of success) or a creature with a CR no greater than the monster's - 5 (with a 60% chance of success). The summoned ally returns to the place from which it came after 1 hour.

Terrain Stride: Choose a type of terrain, such as undergrowth, ice, or rubble. The monster can move through nonmagical terrain of that type without impairing its movement or taking damage.
