Cavalier/Samurai Orders


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide</a>
At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.

A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.

The following orders can be chosen by both samurai and cavaliers, although the former are far more likely to do so. Samurai can also select any of the cavalier orders presented in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide.



Order of Vengeance

Often affiliated with the church of Calistria, those ex- Galtan cavaliers who subscribe to the order of vengeance seek not only to reclaim their rightful homeland, but to punish those who betrayed them.

Edicts: The cavalier must seek retaliation (legal or otherwise) for any unjustified harm to her person or property. She may not forgive even the slightest insult.

Challenge: Whenever a cavalier of the order of vengeance issues a challenge against a creature whose kind she has encountered in the past 24 hours, the cavalier gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made against the target of her challenge. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the cavalier possesses.

Skills: A cavalier of the order of vengeance adds Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (nobility) to her list of class skills. Whenever the cavalier uses Diplomacy to gather information, she receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 her cavalier level (minimum +1).

Order Abilities: A cavalier that belongs to the order of vengeance gains the following abilities as she increases in level.

Air Grievances (Ex): At 2nd level, when the cavalier attempts to demoralize an opponent using Intimidate, the cavalier gains a bonus on her Intimidate check equal to 1/2 her cavalier level. At 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter, the penalties a cavalier's target takes for being demoralized increase by 1.

Eye for an Eye (Ex): At 8th level, the cavalier gains <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a> as a bonus feat. The cavalier can grant a <a href="feats5b67.html?Category=Critical">critical feat</a> (in place of a teamwork feat) to her allies using the tactician ability.

Retribution (Ex): At 15th level, the cavalier gains <a href="cavalierorderscc9e.html?ItemName=Order%20of%20the%20Star">retribution, as the order of the star ability of the same name</a>.
