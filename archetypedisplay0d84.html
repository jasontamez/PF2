Instead of using song and dance, a fortune-teller influences people by divining their fate. Though he learns a great deal about the paths of destiny, his true skill is in making others think he knows more than he truly does.

Fortune-Teller's Divinations: Add the following spells to the fortune-teller's bard spell list. He doesn't automatically gain them and must still select them as spells known if he wants to use them. 0-<a href="spelldisplayebb0.html?ItemName=guidance">guidance</a>;  1st-<a href="spelldisplayaf07.html?ItemName=object%20reading">object reading</a>;  2nd-<a href="spelldisplaybb99.html?ItemName=augury">augury</a>;  3rd-<a href="spelldisplayf363.html?ItemName=analyze%20aura">analyze aura</a>;  4th-<a href="spelldisplaya551.html?ItemName=divination">divination</a>;  5th-<a href="spelldisplaye033.html?ItemName=retrocognition">retrocognition</a>;  6th-<a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a>, <a href="spelldisplay0aab.html?ItemName=vision">vision</a>.

This ability alters the bard's spell list.

Oracular Performance: A fortune-teller can use Perform (oratory) to read a fortune as part of a bardic performance. Once per hour when the bard performs a fortune-telling using a fortune-teller's deck, a crystal ball, or a similar item, he can read the fortune of one subject of the bardic performance. This is part of the same action used to activate the performance. The fortune-teller rolls d%, adds his bard level to the result, and consults the table below. The outcome depends on whether the chosen creature is an ally (for a beneficial performance) or an enemy (for a detrimental performance). <table class="inner"> <tr><td>d%</td><td>Result for Ally</td><td>Result for Enemy</td></tr> <tr><td>1-35</td><td>Woe</td><td>Weal</td></tr> <tr><td>36-65</td><td>Inconclusive</td><td>Inconclusive</td></tr> <tr><td>66</td><td>Weal</td><td>Woe</td></tr></table>  On an inconclusive result, the bard fails to get any information from the reading and the subject is affected by the performance normally. For an ally, on a weal result the subject's bonus from the performance increases by 1, and on a woe result the subject's bonus decreases by 1 (minimum 0). This affects only numeric bonuses. For example, a subject wouldn't gain another Hit Die from inspire greatness.

For an enemy, on a weal result the subject gains a  bonus on its saving throw to negate the bard's performance, and on a woe result it takes a -2 penalty on its save. An oracular performance has no effect on an enemy if the performance doesn't require a saving throw.

All adjustments from an oracular performance on a foe last only for that instance of the bardic performance. All adjustments on an ally last for 1 minute, applying each time the fortune-teller uses that particular bardic performance on that ally but ending when the duration expires, even if the performance continues.

This ability alters bardic performance and replaces countersong and distraction.

Fortune-Teller's Acumen: At 2nd level, whenever he casts a spell from the divination school, a fortune-teller can use a fortune-teller's deck, crystal ball, or similar item instead of the spell's material component, as long as the cost of the material component is no more than 100 gp per bard level. If he chooses to cast the spell using such an item and the spell's normal material component (regardless of that component's cost), he casts the spell at  caster level. This special focus can't be used with other special foci that have a similar effect, but can be used with spells that normally require a focus component (which must also be provided).

This ability replaces well-versed.

Bardic Performance: A fortune-teller gains the following bardic performance.

Transparent Fate (Su): At 8th level, the fortune-teller can cause all enemies within 30 feet to have their near future revealed for all to see. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10  1/2 the fortune-teller's level  the fortune-teller's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability causes any creature attacked by an affected enemy to gain a  bonus to AC and on saving throws against the attack. As a secondary effect, if an affected creature's hit points are reduced to less than its Constitution score, it also sees a vision of its own death and must succeed at another Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A given creature needs to save against this secondary effect at most once per performance of transparent fate, even if its hit points are reduced to less than its Constitution score multiple times. A creature that was targeted by oracular performance when this performance began applies any save DC adjustment to this secondary save as well. At the GM's discretion, the revelation of the creature's fate might have other consequences; for example, a creature's allies might see it was planning to betray them.

This ability replaces dirge of doom.
