Description

This armor's ability functions only if its wearer has the panache class feature. When a melee attack made by an enemy within the wearer's melee reach would reduce the wearer to fewer than 0 hit points, the wearer can spend 1 panache point as an immediate action. This allows her to make a single melee attack against the creature that reduced her to 0 hit points or fewer. This occurs prior to the wearer falling unconscious or dead.
