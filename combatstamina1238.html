When feinting an opponent, you can spend 5 stamina points to have that opponent lose its Dexterity bonus to AC against the next attack made by any of your allies. If the next ally to attack that opponent also has this feat, that ally's attacks do not count as the next attack for the purpose of this combat trick, allowing another ally to gain this benefit.
