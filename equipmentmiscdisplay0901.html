Description

This kit consists of a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a clay
mug, a dagger, two fishhooks, a flint and steel, a sewing
needle, a signal whistle, 50 feet of string, 50 feet of thread,
a week's worth of trail rations, a waterskin, and a whetstone.
For Small creatures, the weight of a Pathfinder's kit is 7-1/2
pounds. Leaving the bedroll and rations at camp or on a mount
reduces the weight by 12 pounds for Medium creatures and by
3 pounds for Small creatures.
