Description

This set of surgical tools includes everything needed to quickly and safely harvest the venom from a dead creature (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Wilderness 142). This kit includes forceps, a pair of surgical retractors, a scalpel, small but sturdy metal containers for the harvested venom, a sponge, a surgical hook, and a tiny mallet, all tucked into a leather pouch with a loop for hooking onto the wearer's belt. A harvester's kit provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to successfully harvest poison from a creature. A harvester's kit is exhausted after 10 uses.
