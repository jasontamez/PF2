1: Pass Freely (Sp) expeditious retreat 3/day, invisibility 2/day, or blink 1/day
2: Planeswalker (Sp) You gain the ability to cast plane shift once per day.
3: Home at the Crossroads (Sp) Once per day, you can cast maze-the resulting extradimensional labyrinth takes the form of an endless network of empty roads running through a lonely forest. Conversely, you can also choose to target yourself with this ability, in which case you travel to the same extradimensional crossroads yourself, along with any willing targets within 100 feet, and can stay there indefinitely without needing food or drink. Anyone brought there by this second method can leave the crossroads at any time by willing it, but cannot return without another use of this ability.
