Description

When this iron medallion is placed between the palms of two persons willingly entering into an agreement via handshake, the accord is enforced by the brand's enchantment. If either person breaks the word of the agreement, a hideous mark appears on the top of the unfaithful creature's hand. The brand marks her as an oath breaker throughout the River Kingdoms, imposing upon her a -8 penalty on Diplomacy and Bluff checks attempted anywhere in the region as long as the brand is visible. This mark lasts for 1 year or until it is removed by break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish, whichever comes first.
