Description

This reinforced wooden box bears the symbol of a specific goodaligned deity, which the buyer may stipulate at the time of purchase. The kit contains 1 dose of abjurant salt, which is used to create good-aligned barriers; 3 vials of holy water, which can be used against undead creatures or evil outsiders; and a pouch of silver dust worth 25 gp, which is a material component of the spell consecrate. An exorcism kit also counts as an altar for the purposes of determining bonuses and penalties for the spell consecrate.
