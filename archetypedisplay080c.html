Figments are born from their masters' imaginations rather than being ordinary creatures that are awakened.

Recurring Dream (Su): A figment has a total number of hit points equal to 1/4 of its master's total hit points. If the figment dies, it vanishes, appearing again with 1 hit point after its master awakens from a full night's sleep. If a figment ever strays more than 100 feet from its master or enters an antimagic field, or if a figment's master is unconscious or asleep, the figment disappears until the next time its master prepares spells or regains her spells per day. Because it is a being of its master's mind, a figment can never serve as a witch's familiar, a shaman's spirit animal, or any other spell-granting familiar, and it can't use any divination spells or spell-like abilities the base creature has.

This replaces improved evasion.

Manifest Dreams (Su): At 3rd level, a figment is shaped by its master's dreams. Each time the master awakens from a full night's rest, he can apply to the figment 1 evolution point's worth of eidolon evolutions that don't have a base form requirement. At 7th level, he can apply 2 points' worth of eidolon evolutions; at 13th level, he can apply 3 points' worth of eidolon evolutions.

This replaces deliver touch spells, speak with animals of its kind, and scry on familiar.
