You can't always count on having a source of positive energy to fight haunts, and have mastered an eerie talent for brief ly focusing your own life energy into your weapons.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 1 rank, Perception 1 rank.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a weapon attack against a haunt. If successful, your attack deals damage equal to your weapon dice plus any enhancement bonus (but not other bonuses, such as those granted by Strength, Weapon Specialization, or class features like sneak attack). You can use any Vital Strike feat in order to enhance this attack.
