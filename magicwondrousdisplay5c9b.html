Description

This telescoping brass spyglass functions as a normal spyglass and allows clear vision to the horizon 3 miles away at sea level. From atop a typical crow's nest or 70-foot-tall tower like Tidewater Rock, this vision extends to over 10 miles. Once per day, the user of a farglass can activate a clairaudience/ clairvoyance effect upon any location seen through the farglass's lens. As long as the location is kept in sight through the lens, the clairaudience/clairvoyance sensor can move with the location. This effect lasts for up to 5 minutes.
