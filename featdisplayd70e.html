Using its powerful tail to charge at an incredible speed, a bunyip can explode through the water's surface and get the jump on terrestrial prey.

Prerequisites: Str 15, bunyip.

Benefit:  While underwater, the bunyip can make a special charge attack against a creature on land. As long as the target is no farther away than half the bunyip's swim speed (25 feet for most bunyips) from the body of water the bunyip is attacking from, the bunyip can break through the surface of the water and continue its charge as it soars through the air and toward the target of its attack. The bunyip can still only move up to twice its swim speed while making a breach attack. This attack otherwise follows all the normal rules for a charge attack.
