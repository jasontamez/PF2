When using the Power Attack feat and wielding a two-handed melee weapon or a onehanded melee weapon with two hands, you can spend 5 stamina points. If you do, each successful attack you make against a target reduces your Power Attack penalty against that target by 1 (to a minimum of 0) until the beginning of your next turn.
