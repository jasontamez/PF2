Description

These goggles come in a variety of colors and shapes, but most are sleek and streamlined in appearance. The primary use for these goggles is to enhance vision via the application of a "vision enhancement module," or "veemod." A pair of veemod goggles can be fitted with only one veemod at a time; attaching a veemod is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.

Veemod goggles consume charges only when a veemod is installed. The rate at which a veemod uses charges depends on the veemod installed.
