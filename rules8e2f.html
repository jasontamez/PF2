Once the character's basic concept has been determined, its ability scores must be assigned. Apply the NPC's racial modifiers after the scores have been assigned. For every four levels the NPC has attained, increase one of its scores by 1. If the NPC possesses levels in a PC class, it is considered a heroic NPC and receives better ability scores. These scores can be assigned in any order.

Basic NPCs: The ability scores for a basic NPC are: 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 8.

Heroic NPCs: The ability scores for a heroic NPC are: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8.

Preset Ability Scores: Instead of assigning the scores, you can use Table 14-6 to determine the NPC's ability scores, adjusting them as necessary to fit. Use the Melee NPC ability scores for characters whose primary role involves melee combat, such as barbarians, fighters, monks, paladins, rangers, and warriors. The Ranged NPC ability scores are for characters that fight with ranged weapons or use their Dexterity to hit, such as fighters, rangers, and rogues. Use the Divine NPC ability scores for characters with divine spellcasting capabilities, such as adepts, clerics, and druids. The Arcane NPC ability scores should be used by characters with arcane spellcasting capabilities, such as bards, sorcerers, and wizards. Finally, the Skill NPC ability scores should be used for characters that focus on skill use, such as aristocrats, bards, commoners, experts, and rogues. Some NPCs might not fit into one of these categories and should have custom ability scores.
