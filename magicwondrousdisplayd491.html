Description

At first glance, there is nothing at all unique about this length of woven brown wool; however, in the hands of a spellcaster it can be a devious resource. The wearer of a diminishing sash can tear off a piece of the item and use it as a substitute for spell components worth up to 50 gp. Each piece torn from a diminishing sash (an action subsumed in the casting of a spell) provides components for one spell, and multiple pieces cannot be combined to provide more expensive components. After providing the components for 50 spells, a diminishing sash becomes a nonmagical piece of cloth.

If the sash is used to generate material components for a spell that normally uses no components or components that cost 1 gp or less, the wearer casts the spell at +1 caster level.
