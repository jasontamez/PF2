Description

The eyes of those who chew these pale white flowers widen and turn a milky white. The flowers send the user into a furious rage similar to that of a barbarian, granting a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a -2 penalty to AC. These effects remain active for as long as she chews the flower, up to 1 minute. A creature can begin chewing ghostblossom as a move action and can continue to chew as a free action every round.

A ghostblossom vine flowers once daily through a single 13-week growing period every summer.
