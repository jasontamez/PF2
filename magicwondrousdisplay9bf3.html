Description

The wearer of this rough, gray cloak can, as a move action,
grasp the garment's edge and cause it to harden. The wearer
can use the hardened edge it as if it were a masterwork light
wooden shield. Using the cloak in this fashion imposes no
armor check penalty, but does impose a 5% arcane spell
failure chance. The edge of the cloak can be dropped and
made pliant again as a free action. Shield enhancement
bonuses and special abilities can be added to the cloak as if it
were a masterwork shield.
