Description

This bifurcated mithral rod resembles an oversized tuning fork. The forked rod acts as a focus for <a href="spelldisplaycee0.html?ItemName=Plane%20Shift">plane shift</a>, but the plane to which it is attuned to can be adjusted as a standard action-a forked rod can be attuned to any plane that a common tuning fork (see <a href="spelldisplaycee0.html?ItemName=Plane%20Shift">plane shift</a>) can be attuned to. Once per day, a forked rod can be used to cast <a href="spelldisplaycee0.html?ItemName=Plane%20Shift">plane shift</a> to the plane it is currently attuned to. Three times per day as a standard action, the user can attack a creature or object with a forked rod as if it were a +1 light mace. On a hit, the forked rod deals no damage, but affects the target with <a href="spelldisplay923b.html?ItemName=Dimensional%20Anchor">dimensional anchor</a> for 9 minutes. As long as a target is affected in this way, the forked rod is inert and cannot be used to cast <a href="spelldisplaycee0.html?ItemName=Plane%20Shift">plane shift</a>, as a focus for <a href="spelldisplaycee0.html?ItemName=Plane%20Shift">plane shift</a>, or to affect another target with <a href="spelldisplay923b.html?ItemName=Dimensional%20Anchor">dimensional anchor</a>.
