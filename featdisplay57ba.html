When your ally is in the area of effect of a harmful spell, your foes are caught off guard.

Benefit: When an ally who also has this feat fails her saving throw (including voluntarily failing the save) against a spell that would harm her with an area of effect that includes her, intelligent enemies within the spell's area take a -2 penalty on their saving throws to resist the spell's effects.
