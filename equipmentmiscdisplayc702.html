Description

This large leather wrap contains a foldable wooden framework that sits on stilts, pliable slats of birch bark, additional leather rolls, and consecrated stones. When assembled, the resulting hut is a small dome, suitable as a tent shelter and large enough to fit two crouching Medium humanoids or four Small humanoids. When the stones are heated and water is poured over them to create a thick steam, the hut becomes a sweat lodge for healing ceremonies, and provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks for the faith healing occult skill unlock.
