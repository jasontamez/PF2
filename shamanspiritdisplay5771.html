A shaman who selects the flame spirit has a radiant light behind her eyes and the faint smell of smoke about her. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, a hungry spectral flame dances around her body.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Flame spirit can select from the following hexes.

Cinder Dance (Ex): The shaman's base speed increases by 10 feet. At 5th level, the shaman receives Nimble Moves as a bonus feat. At 10th level, the shaman receives Acrobatic Steps as a bonus feat. The shaman doesn't need to meet the prerequisites of these feats.

Fire Nimbus (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to gain a nimbus of fire. Though this doesn't harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benef it from concealment or invisibility. The target also takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells or effects that deal fire damage. The fire nimbus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's level. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Flame Curse (Su): The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to become vulnerable to fire until the end of the shaman's next turn (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 305). If the creature is already vulnerable to fire, this hex has no effect. Fire immunity and resistances apply as normal, and any saving throw allowed by the effect that caused the damage reduces it as normal. At 8th and 16th levels, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Gaze of Flames (Su): The shaman sees through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty as long as there is enough light to otherwise allow her to see normally. At 7th level, the shaman can gaze through any source of flame within 10 feet per shaman level, as clairvoyance. The shaman can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to her shaman level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Ward of Flames (Su): The shaman touches a willing creature (including herself ) and grants a ward of flames. The next time the warded creature is struck with a melee attack, the creature making the attack takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. This ward lasts for 1 minute, after which it fades away if not already expended. At 8th and 16th levels, the ward lasts for one additional attack. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal is surrounded by a nimbus of flame that gives off light like a candle. This nimbus is warm to the touch, but doesn't cause any damage. The animal is immune to fire damage, but is vulnerable to cold damage (Bestiary 305).

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Flame spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Touch of Flame (Su): As a standard action, the shaman can make a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point for every 2 shaman levels she possesses. A shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a flaming weapon.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Flame spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Fiery Soul (Su): The shaman gains fire resistance 10. In addition, as a standard action she can unleash a 15-foot cone of flame from her mouth, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage per shaman level she possesses. A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between each use.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Flame spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Elemental Form (Su): As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) fire elemental, as if using elemental body IV with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of flame. The shaman gains fire resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any fire spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. She doesn't need to possess these feats to use this ability.
