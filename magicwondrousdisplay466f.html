Description

This crimson devil talisman once belonged to the diabolist Sheel Leroung, a conjurer who aided Daidian Ruel in investigating the ways of Hell. The wearer of this talisman gains a +3 profane bonus to Armor Class and a telepathic bond with the bearded devil bound within. Once per day, the wearer can attempt an opposed Charisma check against the barbazu's +0 modifier to summon him forth for 8 rounds, as per the spell summon monster. The barbazu bound within this talisman is known as Lodveyn the Wizened. Rather than Weapon Focus (glaive), Lodveyn has Throw Anything-preferring to fling his polearm, then following it into the fray with his vicious claws. He claims to have been a servant of both Leroung and the ice devil Voulgarghas, and remembers much of the early days of the Hellknights' founding.
