Description

On a successful critical hit, this +1 kukri deals 2 points of bleed damage, which stacks with any bleed damage already caused by the attack. Each time the wielder strikes a blow that deals bleed damage with this weapon, he gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of bleed damage dealt. No temporary hit points are gained if the target was already bleeding, even for a lesser amount. Temporary hit points bestowed by Balgorrah last for 1 minute.

Balgorrah can cast bleed at will (and does so automatically if it notices any dying creature within 30 feet), and can cast death knell once per day.
