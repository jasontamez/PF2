Ninja Tricks


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat</a>
As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.

Tricks marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a ninja's sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.



Sneak Attack Talents


<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Bleeding Attack* (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 14</a>): A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the ninja's sneak attack. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any DR the creature might possess.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Deadly Range (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 15</a>): A ninja with this ninja trick increases the range at which she can deal sneak attack damage by 10 feet. A ninja can take this trick more than once. Its effects stack.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Ki Block* (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 15</a>): A ninja with this trick can prevent a creature from using its ki pool. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, the target must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool for a number of rounds equal to the ninja's Charisma modifier. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The number of points in the target's ki pool is unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki still function.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pressure Points* (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 15</a>): A ninja with this trick can strike at an opponent's vital pressure points, causing weakness and intense pain. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she also deals 1 point of Strength or Dexterity damage, decided by the ninja. Unlike normal ability damage, this damage can be healed by a DC 15 Heal check. Each successful check heals 1 point of damage caused by this trick. A ninja with this trick receives a +10 insight bonus on this Heal check.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Slow Reactions* (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 16</a>): Opponents that are damaged by the ninja's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round. </td>

When the ninja intercepts an attack using this feat, she can spend 1 ki point to impose a blood debt on the aided ally. The ninja's ki pool is reduced by 1 until she ends this effect, which she may do as an immediate action. If the ninja ends the blood debt in response to a successful attack against her by a creature the indebted ally threatens, the ally (who must be willing) takes full damage from that attack and any associated effects instead of the ninja.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Breath of the Ancestors (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nfl?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-Dragons">Legacy of Dragons pg. 22</a>): The ninja chooses one imperial dragon type (forest, sea, sky, sovereign, or underworld; Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 92-103) when she gains this trick, and the choice can't be changed. She can use supplies similar to those used for ninja smoke bombs to produce an alchemical breath weapon that deals the same kind of damage as the selected dragon (piercing damage for forest dragons, fire for sea dragons, and so on). The breath weapon deals the same amount of damage as the ninja's sneak attack, with a Reflex save allowed for half damage. The breath weapon is a 15-foot cone (or a 30-foot line if the underworld dragon is selected). The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's class level + the ninja's Intelligence modifier.

Creating ki venom is a full-round action that costs 1 ki point. The poison lasts for 24 hours before becoming inert. The poison deals either Strength or Dexterity damage, chosen when the venom is created. The ninja can spend additional ki as part of the process of creating the ki venom to improve the venom in one or more of the following ways: spend 1 ki point to increase the damage die to a d6, spend 1 ki point to change the ability damage dealt to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage, or spend 1 ki point to increase the number of saves required to cure the poison by 1.

This poison affects all creatures in the smoke and lasts as long as the smoke lasts. She must pay for the poison normally. The ninja must have the smoke bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Redirect Force (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy93nc?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Champions-of-Balance">Champions of Balance pg. 18</a>): If the ninja has a feat that allows her to attempt a combat maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity, she can choose to provoke them anyway when she performs that maneuver. If she does so and takes damage from the attack of opportunity, the ninja adds the damage as a bonus on her attack roll instead of as a penalty.</td>

She can hold her breath for twice as long as normal before needing to make Constitution checks (four times her Constitution score). In addition, whenever the ninja is poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison's frequency) is doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of -1/round for 6 rounds' would instead be -1/2 rounds for 12 rounds.-</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Smoke Bomb (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 16</a>): This ability allows a ninja to throw a smoke bomb that creates a cloud of smoke with a 15-foot radius.

<tr>
<td>Assassinate (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 16</a>): A ninja with this master trick can kill foes that are unable to defend themselves. To attempt to assassinate a target, the ninja must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action.

<td>Deadly Shuriken (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 17</a>): As a full-round action, a ninja with this master trick can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shuriken throw. When she does this, she throws a single shuriken at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the attack hits. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the ninja increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0).</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>Evasion (Ex) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 17</a>): A ninja can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ninja is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ninja does not gain the benefit of evasion. </td>

The shadow clones move up to the ninja's speed at her will each time she uses a move action to move. Shadow clones separated in this way are not considered part of the shadow clone trick until they return to the ninja's square, though they can still be destroyed while separated. Shadow clones separated from the ninja have an AC equal to the ninja's AC - 5 and cannot take any actions, though they can provide flanking. Shadow clones do not occupy any space and a creature can freely enter a shadow clone's square. The ninja must have the shadow clone ninja trick to select this trick.</td>

<td>Shadow Split (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 17</a>): This trick allows the ninja to create an illusory double of herself that moves away from her, allowing the ninja to create a distraction. When she uses this ability, an illusory double appears and moves away from the ninja, heading in one direction. The double climbs walls, jumps pits, or simply passes through obstacles, moving at twice the ninja's speed in the direction indicated by the ninja when the ability is used. Its course cannot be changed. The double persists for 1 round per level of the ninja. Those who interact with the double receive a Will saving throw to recognize that it is fake. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.
