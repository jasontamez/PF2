You gain greater skill with the natural power of your blows.

Prerequisites: Str 16, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay29b3.html?ItemName=Wilding">Wilding</a>, <a href="featdisplay5997.html?ItemName=Wilding%20Strike">Wilding Strike</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit: The damage die of your unarmed strikes increases to 1d8 (or 1d6 if you are Small). This does not stack with any other effects that increase the damage die of your unarmed strikes, including levels in classes such as monk. Increases to your actual size category (such as enlarge person) still increase your damage die as normal.
