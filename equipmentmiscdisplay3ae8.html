Description

This holy symbol has a small nail or spike somewhere along its length, allowing it to be hammered it into a wall, tree, floor, or any hard surface. Once fixed in place and activated, it stores channeled energy until it is touched by a creature of at least Small size or 24 hours pass. If touched, the focus releases the stored power as if you used channel energy, though it only heals or deals half the normal damage (including all feats and abilities that affect the DC and damage). Good clerics use these items to provide healing in large battles where a cleric may not be nearby; evil clerics often use them as traps.
