Description

This heavy black cloak is trimmed with silver brocade and jingles ever so slightly when disturbed. The wearer of a cloak of daggers can draw daggers as a free action as though she possessed the Quick Draw feat; if she already has the Quick Draw feat, drawing a single hidden dagger becomes a free action. Once per day, the wearer can perform a cartwheel as a standard action at any point during a move action, creating a 15-foot cone of daggers that deals an amount of piercing damage equal to the wearer's sneak attack damage (minimum 1d6). A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + the number of the wearer's sneak attack dice + the wearer's Intelligence modifier) halves the damage. The daggers disappear immediately.
