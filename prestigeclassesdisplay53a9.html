Golden Legionnaires are members of the Eagle Knight branch known formally as Eagle Knights of the Golden Legion. The foremost protectors of Andoran and its populace, the Golden Legionnaires primarily guard Andoran's borders and watch over the country's untamed rural areas.

Within Andoran's borders, Golden Legionnaires operate independently alongside the nation's armed forces as members of elite military units. These highly capable field commanders and training officers adjust to suit the needs of a particular region, often developing specialized talents to counter specific threats found nearby. Angry fey in the Verduran Forest, tricky kobold traps near the Candlestone Caverns, and dangerous werewolves in Darkmoon Vale all threaten the Golden Legionnaires and their mission to safeguard their homeland. In Andoran's towns and cities, teams of Golden Legionnaires work to thwart spies and sinister agents of foreign powers, such as devious Taldan poisoners, Chelish diabolists, and Okeno bounty hunters.

Above all else, the Golden Legion's duty is domestic security; the Legion extensively trains its soldiers in defensive tactics and strategies that ensure the protection of both Andorens and other members of the Legion. That said, a typical Golden Legionnaire exhibits audacious courage and unflinchingly puts himself between those he protects and possible threats. An ambush or unprovoked attack incenses a Golden Legionnaire and propels him to acts of selfless bravery and daring prowess. Even when they are hundreds of miles away from their homes, Golden Legionnaires use their skills and combat prowess to protect their allies and Andoran's ideals.

While a large proportion of Golden Legionnaire candidates enlist from within the ranks of the Andoren military, the Legion recruits a number of nontraditional soldiers for their special skills. Applicants must demonstrate their devotion to the Andoren ideals of equality, freedom, and justice, as well as obtain a written recommendation from a senior Eagle Knight-or, under unusual circumstances, the personal recommendation of a member of the People's Council, Andoran's legislative body.

The following are class features of the Golden Legionnaire prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A Golden Legionnaire gains proficiency with all simple weapons and all martial weapons, and gains proficiency with all forms of armor and shields.

Authoritative Command (Ex) As a move action, a Golden Legionnaire can issue orders to a number of allies up to half his character level who are within 30 feet and can see, hear, and understand him. As long as at least one selected ally obeys the Golden Legionnaire's orders during that round, the Golden Legionnaire and each compliant ally gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws and to Armor Class for 1 round. Affected allies are not under any obligation to obey these commands, but do not gain the bonuses if they ignore the commands. At 6th level, this bonus increases to +2. At 8th level, a Golden Legionnaire can use authoritative command as a swift action.

Defy Danger (Ex): A Golden Legionnaire gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against one of the following dangers: charms and compulsions, curses, diseases, fear, poisons, traps, or the innate magical powers (spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities not gained from class levels) of one creature type (and subtype, if applicable) chosen from the ranger favored enemy list. At 5th level and again at 9th level, a Golden Legionnaire gains an additional +2 bonus against a different danger; alternatively, he can increase the bonus against a previously selected danger by 2.

Legion Feats: A Golden Legionnaire gains the following bonus feats at the prescribed levels, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites: 2nd level'Stand Still, 4th level- Bodyguard, 6th level-In Harm's Way, 8th level- Swift Aid. If he already has the feat for a given level, he can instead take any other combat feat whose prerequisites he meets.

Intercept (Ex): At 2nd level, a Golden Legionnaire gains a bonus equal to half his class level on combat maneuver checks when using the Stand Still feat, and gains the same bonus to his CMD when an opponent attempts an Acrobatics check to move through a square he threatens.

United Defense (Ex): At 2nd level, a Golden Legionnaire can select one ally as a swift action. While he is adjacent to this ally, the Golden Legionnaire takes a -1 penalty to his Armor Class and the selected ally receives a +2 dodge bonus to his Armor Class for 1 round. At 6th level and again at 10th level, the Golden Legionnaire's AC takes an additional -1 penalty and the dodge bonus increases by an additional 2.

Allied Retribution (Ex): At 3rd level, if a Golden Legionnaire sees a creature within 60 feet of him attack an ally or any friendly creature, including himself, he can select that attacker as a designated adversary. When a Golden Legionnaire does this, he gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against the designated adversary for a number of rounds equal to his class level. A Golden Legionnaire can have a number of designated adversaries up to one-third his class level. If he already has his maximum number of designated adversaries selected, he can end the effects of his allied retribution against one of his previously designated adversaries and select a new one. The Golden Legionnaire can reselect a creature that is already a designated adversary if it attacks an ally or a friendly creature again, allowing him to restart the effect's duration. At 7th level, the morale bonus increases to +2.

Improved Aid (Ex): At 4th level, when a Golden Legionnaire successfully uses the aid another action in combat, the bonus on the ally's attack roll or to its Armor Class increases by 1. At 9th level, the bonus increases by an additional 1.

Hold the Line (Ex): At 5th level, if a creature takes a 5-foot step out of an area both adjacent to and threatened by a Golden Legionnaire, or if a creature withdraws from that area, it provokes an attack of opportunity from him.

Preemptive Strike (Ex): At 7th level, a Golden Legionnaire can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square the Golden Legionnaire threatens, regardless of whether or not this movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. He can use this ability against each opponent once per day, and no more than once per round.

Retaliate (Ex): At 9th level, once per round when a creature threatened by a Golden Legionnaire attacks and hits an ally adjacent to the Golden Legionnaire, he can make an attack of opportunity against that creature.

Guardian of Liberty (Ex): At 10th level, once per day as an immediate action a Golden Legionnaire can reroll a single attack roll or saving throw, or force an enemy to reroll an attack roll made against the Legionnaire or an adjacent ally, after the result of the attack roll is revealed.
