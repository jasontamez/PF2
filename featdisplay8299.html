You were marked from birth with the gift of magic.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, stone giant.

Benefit:  You have a distinguishing feature such as small stature, odd coloration, or crystalline growths on your skin that mark your sorcerous potential. You gain a +1 racial bonus to your caster level when casting sorcerer spells with the earth descriptor. For every 3 sorcerer levels you attain, you add a new spell known of a spell level you can cast. This spell must either be from the abjuration or divination schools or have the earth descriptor.
