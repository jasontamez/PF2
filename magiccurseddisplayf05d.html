Description

This shortbow is beautifully made and inlaid with iridescent
designs, appearing to be a +2 shortbow. When it fires its arrows,
though, it does it with so much force that the arrows are always
broken on either a hit or a miss. This bow must be used as its
owner's primary ranged weapon and can only be discarded after
the owner is subject to a remove curse spell or similar effect.
