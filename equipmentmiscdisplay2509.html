Description

This amulet is made of a dulled dagger wrapped with feathers. When activated, it protects the wearer against undead creatures. The first time the wearer is subject to an attack from an undead creature that requires a saving throw (such as disease, paralysis, or energy drain), the amulet gives the wearer a sacred (if activated with positive energy) or profane (if activated with negative energy) bonus on her saving throw against that attack. This bonus is equal to the number of dice of the activating cleric's channel energy ability. The amulet remains charged until its magic is used or 1 hour has passed.
