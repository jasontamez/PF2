Your phantom is a deadly foe of incorporeal adversaries.

Prerequisites: Phantom class feature, phantom with the magic attacks ability.

Benefit:  Your phantom's natural weapons are treated as having the ghost touch property. In addition, when you cast a touch spell to be delivered by your phantom, you can modify the spell as if you possessed the Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat.
