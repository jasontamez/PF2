You're able to discern subtle and ineffable flaws in a
creature's defenses.


Prerequisites: Knowledge (arcana, dungeoneering, local, nature, planes, or religion) 3 ranks.

Benefit:  After identifying an individual creature with a
successful Knowledge skill check, you can spend a move
action to adapt your tactics to reduce that individual's
natural defenses. Choose one of the following abilities that
you identified: damage reduction, energy resistance, or
spell resistance. For the next 24 hours you treat the selected
ability as if it were 2 lower, to a minimum of 0 (for instance,
you would treat DR 5/magic as if it were DR 3/magic). You
can only benefit from this feat against one single creature
at a time. If you use this feat to adapt your tactics to
another individual before 24 hours have passed since you
last adapted to a creature, the benefit provided against the
first individual ends and is replaced by the benefit against
the second individual. You can switch which identified
creature you have adapted your tactics to (including which
special ability you wish to treat as lower) as a move action.
