Description

A more advanced version of the clockwork prowler, this device is more metal than wood. It moves at a speed of 20 feet and can be programmed with up to four right-angle turns. Each turn requires 1 round to program along with a DC 15 Disable Device check. If this check is failed, roll d% each time the prowler attempts to turn. On a result of 1-10, it fails to turn. On a result of 11-20, it instead turns on the next round. An advanced clockwork prowler can carry up to 60 pounds of weight at full speed, or up to 120 pounds at a speed of 10 feet. It has hardness 10, 150 hit points, and when in motion has AC 15 (a motionless advanced clockwork prowler has AC 8).
