Lengthy Potion

When you brew spells with brief durations into potions, you can extend them to last a full minute.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2e88.html?ItemName=Brew%20Potion">Brew Potion</a>, caster level 10th.

Benefit: When you brew a potion using a spell with a duration of 1 round per caster level, you can increase the spell's duration to 1 minute for the purposes of the resulting potion's effects on the imbiber. This does not stack with any other effect that would increase the duration of the potion, such as the Extend Spell metamagic feat. A spell brewed into a potion this way uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for the purposes of crafting and its cost.


Versatile Brewing

The above feat allows potion brewers to concoct unusual variations in their potions, altering the potions' effects in strange and useful ways. This feat functions similarly to metamagic feats, though it affects the creation of potions instead of the normal casting of spells. Level limits for potions apply to their level after the application of any relevant metamagic feats (if the feat affects the component spell's level).
