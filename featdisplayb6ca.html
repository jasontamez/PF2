You and your allies can quickly jog each other's memories
to remember essential facts.


Benefit:  When an ally who also has this feat attempts a
trained Knowledge skill check while within 30 feet
of you, you may attempt an aid another check
as a free action to improve that ally's skill
check. You must have at least 1 rank in the
Knowledge skill to be aided in order to
use this feat. If you succeed at the aid
another check, you automatically know
any information your ally gains from
the Knowledge check as if you had
rolled the Knowledge check. Whether or
not your aid another check is successful,
you cannot attempt a Knowledge check
to determine the same information as your
ally after using this feat.
