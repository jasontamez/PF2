Description

This musket has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be shot independently as separate attacks, or both can be fired at once as a standard action (the attack action). If both barrels are fired at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the gun becomes wildly inaccurate, taking a -4 penalty on each shot. Each barrel of a double-barreled musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.
