Stone to Flesh Savant

You can use your mercies to transform petrified victims back to flesh.

Prerequisites: Paladin level 12th, lay on hands class feature, mercy class feature.

Benefit: You gain a unique mercy, which aids victims of petrification. Whenever you use your lay on hands ability to heal damage, you can emulate stone to flesh on the target, using your paladin level as your caster level. This functions only on a creature that has been petrified, and it has no effect on other stone.
