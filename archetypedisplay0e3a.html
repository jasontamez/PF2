Though most shamans dole out banes and boons equally, a benefactor seeks to improve the lives of others by primarily offering powerful supportive abilities and magic to her allies and others she deems worthy.

Benefactor Ethos: Benefactors cannot cast shaman spells with the curse descriptor; for the benefactor's purpose, they are considered not on the shaman spell list. A benefactor can't use spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items that use shaman spells with the curse descriptor unless she succeeds at a Use Magic Device check.

This alters the shaman's spellcasting.

Benefactor Hexes: A benefactor adds the following hexes to the list of shaman hexes she can choose from whenever she gains a new hex or a wandering hex. A benefactor cannot gain a hex that is a curse effect or that has the word "curse" in its name as a hex or a wandering hex.

This ability alters hexes.

Boon Reservoir (Su): Once per day, a benefactor can perform a 10-minute ritual with one of her allies, plus one additional ally for every 3 shaman levels she has. All creatures that participate in the ritual (including the benefactor) gain a boon reservoir with a number of points equal to 1/2 the benefactor's shaman level (minimum 1) for 24 hours. As an immediate action, a creature can spend 1 point from its boon reservoir to gain a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws it attempts until the start of its next turn. Boon reservoir points that are not spent within 24 hours are wasted.

Expanded Boon (Su): When a benefactor gains this hex, she chooses one of the following: ability checks, attack rolls, or skill checks. Instead of gaining an insight bonus on saving throws, any creature with a boon reservoir granted by the benefactor can spend 1 point as an immediate action to gain a +2 insight bonus on rolls or checks of the chosen kind until the start of its next turn. This hex can be chosen multiple times. Each time, it applies to a different roll or check. A benefactor must have the boon reservoir hex before choosing this hex.

Suppress Curse (Sp): As a standard action, a benefactor can attempt to suppress one curse effect that is affecting a creature or object with a touch. This functions as per remove curse, except the curse's effects are suppressed for 1 hour, even if it is a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor. This allows a creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove or get rid of it. The benefactor uses her shaman level as her caster level for the purpose of this hex.
