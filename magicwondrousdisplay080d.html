Description

This pointed metallic piton bears a ring the size of a gold piece. A ranged piton is sized and designed so that it can be launched as easily as an arrow. When fired from a bow as a standard action at an object or empty square, the wielder makes a ranged attack against AC 5 to determine whether the piton hits the intended target. Range penalties apply as normal. On a hit, the piton attaches to the point struck, cleaving to vertical and horizontal surfaces alike. An attached ranged piton can be recovered only by speaking a command word while pulling on the piton's ring. Light rope, such as silk rope, can be threaded through the piton's ring before it is fired to rapidly place rope lines.
