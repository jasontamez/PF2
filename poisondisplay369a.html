Description

The putrefying essence of a violet fungus must be harvested with great care from a living specimen and processed quickly before it loses potency. Numerous kinds of subterranean creatures harvest this toxin to help them in their hunts for food, and they coat their weapons in the poison to help defend their underground settlements.
