Description

The call of this hollowed-out animal horn rallies nearby
creatures to battle. When the horn is blown, all creatures
within 60 feet who have not yet acted in combat are no
longer considered flat-footed. The horn has no effect
on other conditions or abilities that treat a creature as
flat-footed.


A barbarian who sounds a horn of battle clarity may spend 2
rounds of rage to act as if she had the superstition rage power for
the remainder of that battle.
