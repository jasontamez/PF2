Coral witches inhabit shallow coasts and reefs where great masses of coral grow. They use their magic to fashion familiars from living coral and emulate the unyielding tenacity of these durable marine organisms. Many coral witches actively patrol and protect their home reefs from predators and help to rebuild the reefs after natural disasters. Although most coral witches are aquatic creatures such as gillmen and locathahs, surface creatures with a deep connection to the sea sometimes become coral witches as well.

Patron: A coral witch's patron is normally endurance, healing, or water, although a coral witch can select any patron other than those associated with fire.

Coral Familiar (Ex): A coral witch crafts her familiar out of living coral, coaxing the tiny organisms to grow in the shape of a larger animal or vermin. The coral witch chooses a familiar as normal, but its type changes to vermin (aquatic) and it gains the amphibious special quality. The coral witch's familiar has an Intelligence score as normal for the witch's level, but it has immunity to mind-affecting effects. When underwater near a coral reef of any size, a coral witch can spend 8 hours to restore her familiar to full health at no cost, unless the familiar is killed, in which case she must follow the usual rules for replacing her familiar. A coral witch can never gain an improved familiar.

This ability alters witch's familiar.

Waves Spirit Hex: A coral witch can select hexes from the shaman's waves spirit (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Class Guide 45) as if they were witch hexes. She uses her witch level as her shaman level to determine the effect of the hex and Intelligence instead of Wisdom to determine its DC.

This ability alters hex.

Immovability (Ex): At 8th level, a coral witch can naturally emulate coral's ability to affix itself in place. At the end of any round in which the coral witch did not move from her space and is standing on solid ground, she adds her class level to her CMD against any bull rush, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers, grapple attempts to move her, and attempts to pull or push her. This bonus lasts until the start of the coral witch's next turn.

This ability replaces the hex gained at 8th level.

Hexes: The following witch hexes complement the coral witch archetype: evil eye, feral speech, water lung.

Major Hexes: The following major hexes complement the coral witch archetype: beast eye, hag's eye, weather control.

Grand Hexes: The following grand hex complements the coral witch archetype: life giver.
