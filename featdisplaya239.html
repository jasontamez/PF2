When making a mounted charge, you can spend a number of stamina points up to your Strength bonus. If your charge attack hits, you deal an amount of extra damage equal to the number of stamina points you spent. This additional damage is doubled by this feat (or tripled if you're using a lance).

Mythic Spirited Charge

Your mounted charge knocks the wind and wits from those foolish enough to stand against you.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya239.html?ItemName=Spirited%20Charge">Spirited Charge.</a>

Benefit:  When you hit an opponent with a mounted charge, that opponent must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If you use a lance with this attack, increase the saving throw DC by 2. As a free action before you make the attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to daze your opponent on a failed saving throw instead of staggering it.
