Description

These steel and brass pauldrons feature two brass lion heads,
one on each shoulder. Twice a day as an immediate action
when a creature successfully makes an Acrobatics check to
move through the wearer's threatened area or its space without
provoking an attack of opportunity, a shadowy lion can animate
from one of the pauldrons and attack that creature. The attack
uses the wearer's base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier and
attacks the target's touch AC. On a hit, the lion deals 2d6 points
of piercing damage (??2 critical).
