Some curses function in an unusual fashion compared to others. The following section presents several templates that can be applied to any curse to represent variants of that curse. These templates function similarly to templates that can be applied to creatures, and you could potentially apply several templates to the same curse to create a truly horrifying effect.

Contagious Curse

Effect In addition to the curse's normal effect, the curse is transmissible to other creatures by a particular means. This could be similar to transmission methods for a disease, or it could be something more esoteric, such as by song or love.

Cure The accursed creature's attempts to remove its own curse with magic automatically fail, though other creatures can do so as normal. Whatever its other means of transmission, a creature attempting to cure the original creature's curse with magic is automatically exposed to the curse and must succeed at a saving throw to avoid being afflicted by it.

Death Curse

Effect A death curse usually occurs upon the deaths of <a href="monsterfamilies1955.html?ItemName=Linnorm">linnorms</a>, some fey, or hags, but other creatures can also curse their killers. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the creature's Hit Dice + the creature's Charisma modifier, rather than the curse's normal DC. A death curse's effect is the same as the original curse, and the effect tends to vary based on the cursing creature's HD.

Cure In addition to the standard cures, the first time that the creature who placed the death curse returns to life, the accursed creature receives a new saving throw to break the curse. If the accursed contributes to this resurrection, she receives a +4 bonus on this saving throw.

Generational Curse

Effect In addition to cursing the original target creature, this curse continues to curse the target's children, and their children, and so on across multiple generations. It is possible it might carry on only to certain children (such as daughters or firstborn children).

Cure Generational curses can usually be cured only by special means, though the extinction of a family line also is able to end its threat. Even if <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> can cure the curse on an individual target, it doesn't stop the generational curse from affecting future generations, which must deal with the curse in their own manner.
