Description

An implant mesh is a cybernetic augmentation that enhanced other cybernetic implants, notably those that heighten their wearers' physical abilities. If used to enhance cyberfiber muscles, a thoracic nanite chamber, or wirejack tendons, an implant mesh must be installed on that piece of cyberware before the item is implanted in a body. If the check to implant the mesh into the other cybernetic item fails, the implant mesh is destroyed.

Once a piece of cybertech has been augmented by an implant mesh, that cybertech implant no longer counts as taking up a body slot for the purposes of installing other cybernetic devices into that slot. Enhancing a cybernetic device with an implant mesh doesn't alter the device's install DC, but does increase its implantation value by 2. For example, a mark II thoracic nanite chamber enhanced with an implant mesh could be implanted in a creature that already has cyberfiber muscles or dermal plating, but the augmented thoracic nanite chamber's implantation value increases to 6.
