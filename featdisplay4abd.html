Blighted Critical (Critical)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 143</a>
With a critical hit from a spell or spell-like ability, you give the target a minor spellblight.

Prerequisites: Caster level 5th.

Benefit:  Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a touch spell, ranged touch spell, or spell-like ability against an opponent, the victim gains a random minor spellblight (see page 95).

Special:  You can apply the effects of only one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess Critical Mastery.
