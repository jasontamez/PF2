Icy Stare

Your eyes burn like ice, allowing you to freeze and weaken foes with a glance.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc6f5.html?ItemName=Born%20of%20Frost">Born of Frost</a>, frost giant.

Benefit:  As a standard action, you can direct your icy stare against a single creature or object within 10 feet. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 1d6 points of cold damage. Unattended objects cannot attempt a saving throw. Creatures damaged by the spell must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage.

This feat doesn't grant an actual gaze attack-foes and allies are not in danger simply by meeting your gaze.
