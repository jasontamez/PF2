Description

Crafted from a single piece of iron, a kunai has a leaf-shaped blade and a ring for a pommel. Adapted from the common trowel, the kunai has a thick blade that is sharpened only near the tip. Unlike finer weapons, the kunai can readily substitute for a crowbar or piton without being damaged in the process.
