Description

This viciously barbed +1 spiked chain consists of a jagged hook at the end of a length of rusty chain. It twitches of its own accord, as if it had some semblance of cruel intelligence. As the wielder swings it, the chain contracts and expands with a seemingly endless supply of new links. As a free action, the wielder can cause the chain to expand, giving the weapon reach for 1 round. The weapon doesn't threaten adjacent squares when it's expanded. The wielder can't reverse this change manually; he must wait for it to expire.

If the wielder of a hooked massacre uses it for a drag or reposition combat maneuver that brings the target adjacent to him, he can make an attack against the target at his highest base attack bonus as an immediate action.
