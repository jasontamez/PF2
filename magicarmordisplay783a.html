Description

The following suit of armor is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

A suit of gnome scrap armor protects its wearer as +2 studded leather armor, but myriad metal trinkets festoon it in place of studs. A number of these badges bear a special dweomer; each such badge can be removed as a move action, at which point it turns into a full-sized version of the trinket. The wearer automatically recognizes which badges have this property, and only the wearer can detach them.

A fully stocked suit of gnome scrap armor holds 20 badges representing the following gear: a flask of acid, two flasks of alchemist's fire, a block and tackle, a buckler, a crowbar, a heavy pick, a folded net, a potion of invisibility, a potion of lesser restoration, a shovel, two lit sunrods, two tanglefoot bags, a throwing axe, a thunderstone, a warhammer, a bottle of fine wine, and a winter blanket. When the armor has 10 or fewer badges remaining, it is reduced to +1 studded leather armor until sufficient badges are returned. If all the patches are removed, the armor becomes nonmagical masterwork studded leather armor.

While the armor retains any magic, the wearer can return badges to the armor by casting shrink item on the appropriate object while wearing the armor and touching the object to the armor. This can even convert appropriate potions into badges, despite shrink item not normally working on magic items. Only items exactly corresponding to missing badges can be merged with the armor. Merging a potion reduces the potion's caster level to the minimum caster level for that spell. Items produced by gnome scrap armor match the size of the armor, so the typical gnome-sized version of the suit produces items sized for Small creatures.
