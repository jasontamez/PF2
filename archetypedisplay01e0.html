Some kineticists have such a powerful personality that they can seize control of their element with their minds alone, without endangering their bodies.

Mind Over Matter (Ex):  An overwhelming soul uses her Charisma modifier instead of her Constitution modifier to determine her damage with wild talents, the DCs of Constitutionbased wild talents, the duration of wild talents with a Constitution-based duration, her bonus on concentration checks for wild talents, and the other Constitution-based effects of all her wild talents. She adds Bluff and Diplomacy to her list of kineticist class skills. This ability alters the kineticist's class skills and the key ability score of wild talents.

Mental Prowess (Su):  An overwhelming soul's mind is strong enough to protect her body from the stress of channeling the elements. However, in exchange, she is unable to push her limits quite as far as other kineticists. She can't choose to accept burn, though she can use wild talents with a burn cost if she can reduce that cost to 0 points with abilities such as gather power and infusion specialization. If she would be forced to accept burn against her will (for example, if she fails a concentration check), instead of taking burn she takes 1 temporary negative level, which never kills her and can't be removed with restoration or greater restoration, but which disappears automatically after 24 hours. At 6th level, once per day, she can reduce the total burn cost of any wild talent by 1. She can use this ability an additional time per day at 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This ability alters burn and replaces internal buffer.

Overwhelming Power (Ex):  At 3rd level, an overwhelming soul gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls with her kinetic blasts. The damage bonus doesn't apply to kinetic blade, kinetic whip, or other infusions that don't apply the damage bonus from elemental overflow. This bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. This ability replaces elemental overflow.
