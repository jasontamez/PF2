Description

The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

Ulfen raiders traditionally fight carrying a shield alongside a battleaxe or sword, leading to an arms race between armorers who seek to produce unstoppable weapons and those who seek to make impenetrable shields. Shields' bane is a long-bearded +1 battleaxe that ignores all shield bonuses to the target's AC. Additionally, the wielder gains a +4 competence bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder or disarm a foe of equipment that grants a shield bonus.
