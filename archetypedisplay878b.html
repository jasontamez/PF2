Sunriders help their allies, be they fellow tribe members or fellow adventurers, to survive in harsh desert terrain, while simultaneously making it even harsher for their foes. They seem to share a single mind with their loyal steeds, and companions who ride with them become an eerily wellcoordinated cavalry unit that traverses the treacherous desert sands with ease to wreak havoc upon invaders. Sunriders almost never leave their tribal homelands; those found outside Al-Zabrit are usually either exiles or emissaries sent to deal with issues that can't be addressed from their holds.

Class Skills: A sunrider gains Knowledge (local) as a class skill, but does not gain Profession as a class skill.

This alters the druid's class skills.

Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: A sunrider gains proficiency with the shortbow, but not with the scythe, sickle, or quarterstaff.

This alters the druid's weapon and armor proficiencies.

Nature Bond (Ex): A sunrider must use this ability to bond with a horse or a pony as an animal companion; she cannot choose a different animal or choose a domain instead of an animal companion.

This alters nature bond.

Born to the Saddle (Ex): At 2nd level, while wearing light or no armor, a sunrider does not need to attempt Ride checks for any task listed in the Ride skill with a DC of 15 or lower. She does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding her mount.

This ability replaces woodland stride.

Mounted Advantage (Su): At 3rd level, any allied mount within 30 feet of a sunrider can ignore the effects of rocky or sandy difficult terrain.

This ability replaces trackless step.

Desert Born (Ex): A sunrider is at home in the desert. At 4th level, she gains a  bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks while she is in desert terrain. Mounted allies traveling with her likewise gain a  bonus on initiative checks and Perception and Survival checks while in desert terrain, as long as they are within 30 feet of the sunrider.

This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Concerted Effort (Ex): At 4th level, a sunrider can extend the bond she shares with her horse to other nearby mounted companions, forming them into a fighting force that seems to share a single mind. Allied mounts within 60 feet of the sunrider gain evasion as per the animal companion special ability. At 6th level, the range expands to 90 feet and allied mounts gain a foot enhancement bonus to their speed. At 8th level, the range expands to 120 feet and allied mounts gain devotion as per the animal companion special ability. At 10th level, allied mounts gain multiattack as per the animal companion special ability. At 12th level, allied mounts gain a  bonus on saving throws. At 14th level, allied mounts gain a foot enhancement bonus to their speed. At 16th level, allied mounts gain improved evasion as per the animal companion special ability. At 18th level, allied mounts gain a  dodge bonus to their Armor Class and a  bonus on attack rolls. At 20th level, allied mounts gain DR 5/- and energy resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. These abilities function only while allied mounts are within range of the sunrider (her own mount always counts as an ally).

This ability replaces wild shape.
