Description

This belt is worked with images of horses stampeding across
a barren, windswept plain. The belt's wearer automatically
succeeds at any check to guide with the knees, stay in the
saddle, fight with a combat-trained mount, control a mount in battle, or make a fast mount or dismount, as long as the belt's
wearer is wearing medium, light, or no armor. Furthermore,
the belt grants a +4 competence bonus on all other Ride checks,
including ones made while the wearer is in heavy armor.
