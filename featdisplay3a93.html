You gain the powers of undeath when you feed upon their kind.

Prerequisites: Nabasu, Con 23

Benefit:  As a full-round action, you can consume the animating force of any undead creature you have created with your death-stealing gaze. This immediately destroys the undead creature, but grants you one of that creature's special attacks or supernatural abilities (chosen from one of the following abilities possessed by the undead: Constitution drain, disease, energy drain, or paralysis). The ability granted persists for 24 hours or until the next sunrise, whichever comes first.
