Strength Greater
Whenever the arcanist uses the lightning lance exploit, she can expend 2 points from her arcane reservoir instead of one. If she does, all creatures adjacent to the target take an amount of damage equal to half the amount of electricity damage rolled. Adjacent creatures can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve this damage. Whether or not the target makes its saving throw has no effect on adjacent targets. The arcanist must have the lightning lance exploit to select this exploit.
