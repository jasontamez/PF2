Through training and persistence inspired by the Great Purge of Stavian I, you have learned to detect the sources of divine magic in such effects' auras.

Prerequisites: Ability to cast <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> as a spell or spell-like ability.

Benefit: When you use <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> to determine the strength and location of the aura of a functioning spell, if that spell's caster used a holy symbol as a divine focus to cast the spell, you see a ghostly image of the deity's holy symbol as part of the spell's aura. Effects that block divination spells or effects also block the effects of this feat.
