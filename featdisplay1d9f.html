Fearless Zeal (Story)

You're willing to lay down your life for your faith.


Prerequisites: You must be ordained as a sacred (or
profane) champion of your faith by a high-ranking
member of its clergy, or have the Devoted, Faith-Bringer, or Moral Debt background. Such an honor goes above and
beyond the normal oaths required of a cleric or paladin.

Benefit:  Once per day, you can add a +2 bonus on any
single attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill
check. You must choose to add this bonus after the die has
been rolled and success or failure determined, but before any results (such as damage) are rolled and applied. If you
have 10 or more levels or hit dice, this bonus increases to +4.


Goal:  Die in pursuit of your faith's goals and be brought
back to life. If you die in circumstances that don't involve
your faith, you gain no benefit. If your GM permits, you
can instead remain dead and create a new PC inspired by
your heroic sacrifice.


Completion Benefit:  If you died and came back, you
become a living symbol of faith. Once per day as a standard
action, you can inspire those who share your faith to great
effort, granting them a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls
and saving throws for 1 minute. This is a mind-affecting,
language-dependent effect. If you create a new character
inspired by your previous character, the new PC receives a
+2 bonus to a single ability score. This ability score can't be
one that already has a racial bonus. The new PC can later
take this feat if he meets the prerequisite.
