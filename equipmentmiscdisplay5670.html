Description

This alchemically concocted black ink can be attuned to a standard sheet of parchment. Anything inscribed using the ink (anywhere on the same plane of existence) appears on the attuned parchment in a sparkling blue script that lasts 1 hour. There is enough ink in one vial to fill one sheet of parchment. The ink cannot duplicate any written magical effects, such as a symbol of death (as per the spell of the same name). Crafting a vial of ink of stolen secrets requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check.
