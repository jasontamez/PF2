Description

Metal armor can be polished to reflect light in your enemies' eyes. In areas of bright light, all enemies within 30 feet that can see you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or be dazzled for 1 round. Regardless of the result of its saving throw, a target may only be affected by this armor modification once per day.

Drawback

Polished armor imparts a -10 penalty to Stealth checks made in areas of bright or normal light.
