When you channel positive energy, you can also channel ki.

Prerequisites: Channel positive energy class feature, worshiper of Irori.

Benefit:  When you channel positive energy to heal living creatures, any creature that could be healed by the channeled energy can choose to regain ki from it instead. Affected creatures regain a number of ki points equal to the number of dice healed by the channel. A creature regaining ki in such a way must either regain ki or be healed by the channel (it cannot gain both).
