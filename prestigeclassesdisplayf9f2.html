The empyreal lord Vildeis doesn't demand acts of self-mortification. Nonetheless, some devoted turn their own skins into scarred manuscripts of noteworthy deeds and unforgettable failures. Those who wholly embrace these rites of scarification are known as scar seekers. There is no formal order of scar seekers. Instead, the path is a personal journey guided by the practitioner's convictions and experiences. Even when two scar seekers meet, they rarely remain together longer than it takes to compare their wounds or thwart a nearby fiend, as such disciples too often attempt to outdo one another's pain.

The following are the class features of the scar seeker prestige class.

Enduring Scar (Su): As a scar seeker gains levels, he accumulates scars of supernatural significance. He can activate his enduring scars abilities in any combination a number of times per day equal to half his class level plus his Charisma modifier. At 1st level and every 2 class levels thereafter, the scar seeker awakens a new enduring scar selected from the list below.

Blood: As a swift action, the scar seeker can imbue a melee weapon he wields with the vicious weapon special ability for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). At 5th level, he can select this scar a second time to increase the extra damage to 2d8 and the damage received to 1d8. At 9th level, he can select the scar a third time to increase the extra damage to 2d10 and damage received to 1d10.

Healing: When the scar seeker uses his lay on hands ability to heal another creature, the scar seeker can use this scar to heal double the normal amount of damage; however, the scar seeker immediately takes damage equal to half the amount he healed, and this damage cannot be reduced or otherwise prevented in any way.

Martyr: When the scar seeker is brought below 0 hit points, he can expend all his remaining uses of lay on hands (minimum 1) as an immediate action in order to heal his allies and harm evil enemies in a 30-foot radius. He restores or deals an amount of damage equal to 4d6 plus his level, and the damage increases by 1d6 for each use of lay on hands he expends; a creature takes half damage if it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + the scar seeker's level + his Charisma modifier). The damage dealt by this ability comes from holy power and is not subject to damage reduction, energy immunities, or any energy resistances. The scar seeker must be 5th level in order to select this scar.

Mercy: When the scar seeker uses his lay on hands ability, he can use this scar to apply the benefits of a paladin mercy he doesn't have but for which he qualifies. A scar seeker's class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the mercy ability. The scar seeker must be 3rd level to select this scar.

Sacrifice: As an immediate action, the scar seeker can share the damage taken by one ally he can see within 30 feet. This functions as per shield other, but lasts only until the end of his next turn or until his ally moves farther than 30 feet from the scar seeker. The scar seeker must be 3rd level to select this scar.

Suffering: As a swift action, the scar seeker's skin and nerves harden until the beginning of his next turn, granting him DR 2/- and a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects with the emotion or fear descriptor. At 7th level, he can select this scar a second time to increase the damage reduction and saving throw bonus to half his class level.

Tenacity: When a scar seeker is struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, the scar seeker can gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier as an immediate action. If the scar seeker already receives a morale bonus on one or more of these rolls, the morale bonus increases by 1 while this ability lasts.

Painful Purification (Su): A scar seeker can relive his past sacrifices in order to activate an enduring scar's ability, even if he has expended all his daily uses of the ability. Rather than expend a daily use of enduring scars, he can activate a scar by taking 1 point of damage per Hit Die he has. This damage can't be healed by any means other than getting a full night's rest, which removes all damage dealt in this fashion. This damage cannot be ignored, reduced, or redirected.

Lay on Hands (Su): At 2nd level, a scar seeker gains the ability to lay on hands. This ability functions as the paladin ability of the same name. For the purpose of this ability, a scar seeker's class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the lay on hands ability.

Smite Evil (Su): At 4th level, a scar seeker gains the ability to smite evil. This ability functions like the paladin ability of the same name, but the scar seeker's effective paladin level equals his class level - 3 (minimum 1). For the purpose of this ability, a scar seeker's class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the smite evil ability. He gains another use per day of this ability at 8th level.

Sanguine Sacrifice (Su): At 6th level, when a scar seeker uses the painful purification ability, he gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 hour. Multiple uses of this ability increase the morale bonus by 1 (maximum one-third his class level).

True Martyr (Su): At 10th level, a scar seeker can embrace death in a final act of defiance. As an immediate action, he can take half the damage dealt to all allies within 60 feet by a single effect, such as a breath weapon, melee attack, or cave-in. If this damage would kill the scar seeker, his blood coalesces in his space in the form of a lawful good monadic deva (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 27) that fights in his place for 1 minute before dissipating. A scar seeker can use this ability once per week.
