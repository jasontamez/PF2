Description

This bolt-action rifle is
the mainstay of Russian military forces. It is similar to the
advanced firearms rif le with the following differences. It
uses the same 7.6254mmR ammunition as the Madsen
machine gun, and is fed from a 5-round internal, nondetachable
magazine that is typically loaded with 5-round
stripper clips (loading it is a move action). Without stripper
clips, you may only reload up to 2 rounds of ammunition
as a move action. Ammunition is typically sold in groups
of 5 rounds. The rifle has a lug for the
attachment of a socket bayonet, and
can be equipped with a unique sidemount
scope system (see below).
