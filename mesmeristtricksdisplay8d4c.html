While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject's forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect.

This is a masterful trick.
