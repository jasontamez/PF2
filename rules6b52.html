Armor pieces fitted for Small characters weigh half as much, and armor pieces fitted for Large characters weigh twice as much.
2 When running while wearing this armor piece, you move only triple your speed, not quadruple.
3 These armor pieces are considered to be one weight category lower when worn with no other armor pieces. A chain torso armor piece worn alone is a chain shirt (light armor), and a plate or agile plate torso armor piece is a breastplate (medium armor).

Agile Plate Torso Armor Piece: This breastplate is designed to allow its wearer extra flexibility. When worn alone, the wearer's armor check penalty for the Climb and jump checks is only -1 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty).

Alternatively, when worn with an agile lamellar arm armor piece and a chain leg armor piece (or lighter armor), the armor check penalty for Climb and jump checks is only -4 (masterwork and mithral versions of this armor and the above armor piece combination reduce this penalty as well as the normal penalty). Furthermore, when an agile plate torso armor piece is worn alone, it is considered to be medium armor instead of heavy armor except when creating special material versions of this armor.

Armored Coat: This sturdy leather coat is reinforced with metal plates sewn into the lining. While more cumbersome than other torso armor pieces, and less effective, it can be donned or removed with a move action (there is no "don hastily" option for the armored coat). This torso armor piece can be worn with other armors, but the wearer takes the best armor bonus instead of adding up all the armor bonuses.

Banded Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece is a shirt of overlapping metal plates reinforcing leather.

Chain Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece is a shirt of chain mail. When worn alone, it is counted as light armor and acts as a chain shirt.

Do-Maru: This light-weight armor piece wraps around the body like a short armored coat made of lamellar.

Four-Mirror Armor: This cuirass consists of four plates harnessed together with leather shoulder straps. It includes a helmet.

Haramaki: Also called a belly-warmer, a haramaki is a simple silken sash lined with chainmail or articulated metal plates and tied about the stomach to protect it.

Hide Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece is a shirt, wrap, or jacket constructed of the tanned and preserved skin of a thick-skinned beast.

Horn Lamellar Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece consists of a shirt constructed of a number of horn plates that are laced together in parallel rows and reinforced with leather.

Iron Lamellar Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece is a shirt constructed of a number of iron plates that are laced together in parallel rows and reinforced with bits of chainmail.

Kikko Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece is a shirt of hexagonal iron plates sewn into cloth or leather.

Kusari Gusoku Torso Armor Piece: This chain jacket is worn in place of heavier chest armor.

Lamellar Cuirass: This cuirass is made of lacquered leather plates bound together and fitted over a silk shirt. It is sometimes worn alone, especially during ceremonial occasions when wearing other armor is frowned upon.

Leather Lamellar Torso Armor Piece: This shirt or cuirass is constructed of a number of discrete hard-boiled leather plates laced together in parallel rows.

Leather Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece is a shirt or jacket constructed of hard-boiled leather carefully sewn together into one piece.

Mountain Pattern Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece is a shirt of a number of interlocking steel pieces riveted onto cloth or leather.

O-Yoroi Torso Armor Piece: This complicated and multipart cuirass also includes a kabuto helmet and a ho-ate mask for further protection.

Padded Torso Armor Piece: This shirt or jacket is made of heavy or quilted cloth.

Plate Torso Armor Piece: This is a breastplate made of steel. When worn in conjunction with other armors, it also includes a helmet. When worn alone, it counts medium armor, acts as a breastplate, and does not include a helmet.

Quilted Cloth Torso Armor Piece: This shirt or jacket is made of heavy quilted cloth specially designed to trap arrows and other ranged piercing weapons. When worn alone, or with only other quilted cloth pieces, you gain DR 3/- against ranged piercing weapons.

Scale Torso Armor Piece: This shirt or cuirass is made up of dozens of small overlapping metal plates.

Silken Ceremonial Armor: Used primarily for ceremonial displays and sometimes worn over heavy armor, these robes consist of several layers of cloth over an outer layer of embroidered silk further reinforced with leather studs. It can be worn over other torso armor pieces, but does not grant any extra armor bonus, and increases the weight and cost of such armor.

Splint Torso Armor Piece: This shirt or cuirass is constructed of metal strips reinforced with chain mail.

Steel Lamellar Torso Armor Piece: This armor piece consists of a shirt or cuirass of steel plates laced together in parallel rows. A steel lamellar torso armor piece includes a helmet.

Stone Coat: This weighty cuirass consists of lamellar crafted from alchemically treated stone. If worn with other armor pieces, this torso armor piece gains no armor bonus from the other armor pieces, and all of the added hindrances.

Studded Leather Torso Armor Piece: This shirt or jacket is constructed of hard-boiled leather carefully sewn together and reinforced with metal studs.

Tatami-Do Torso Armor Piece: A lighter version of a o-yoroi torso armor piece, this piece is constructed of a lighter lamellar shirt. It includes a collapsible kabuto helmet and an armored hood.

Wooden Torso Armor Piece: This shirt or cuirass is constructed of fire-treated wood sewn over leather.
