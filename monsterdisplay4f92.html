Special Abilities

Death Dive (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a marine crocodile can perform a deadly dive upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it uses the force of its powerful tail to propel it downward in the water, allowing it to use both the move and damage actions as part of its grapple attempt. If successful, the marine crocodile maintains its grapple.

Hold Breath (Ex) A marine crocodile can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 8 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.

Description

The marine crocodile resembles its land-based cousins in general body shape and size, though its legs are a hybrid of webbed feet and nascent fins. Its long tail is thinner and flatter than those of traditional crocodilians, allowing the marine crocodile to swim with alarming speed as it whips its tail back and forth.

Marine crocodiles generally remain in warm, shallow oceans and seas. They spend most of their time at sea hunting fish, sea mammals, aquatic humanoids, and monstrous humanoids like merfolk, sahuagin, and locathahs. Only when breeding and laying eggs do marine crocodiles venture onto land (where they are slow and clumsy), before returning to the sea.
