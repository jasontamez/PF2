Description

This altar consists of a large, 6-foot-tall golden statue of Sarenrae as she is represented in her holy symbol. The altar is typically illuminated by a sacred brazier lit beneath the towering statue, causing it to cast a looming, solemn shadow on the ceiling overhead. Praying at the altar grants a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves and increases the benefits of any healing effects that target the worshiper by +1 caster level.
