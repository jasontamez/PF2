Description

These gauntlets perform according
to their appearance until the wearer
finds herself under attack or in a lifeand-
death situation. At that time,
the curse is activated. The wearer
becomes fumble-fingered, with a
50% chance each round of dropping anything held in either
hand. The gauntlets also lower the wearer's Dexterity score by 2
points. Once the curse is activated, the gloves can be removed
only by means of a remove curse spell, a wish, or a miracle.
