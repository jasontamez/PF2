Description

You infuse the target with the blood used as a material component, imparting malicious power. As long as the hat is worn (occupying the wearer's head slot as though it were a magic item), it grants its wearer a +2 bonus on damage rolls and causes the wearer to regain 1d4 hit points whenever they deal the killing blow to a living creature.
