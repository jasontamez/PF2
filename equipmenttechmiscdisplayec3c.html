Description

A trauma pack plus functions as a trauma pack, except that it's advanced chemicals and tools allow someone to restore a recently slain creature to life if the healing provided by the trauma pack plus is administered within 1 round of the target's death, as breath of life. A trauma pack heals 2d8+2 points of damage on a successful DC 15 Heal check. For every 5 points by which the result exceeds the DC, the pack provides an additional 2d8+2 points of healing.
