Destruction

The Tarnhelm can be destroyed by being struck by a succession by hammer blows from a dwarven smith wielding an adamantine hammer, a human smith with a steel hammer, and an elven smith using a hammer of spun glass. Each must succeed at a DC 30 Craft (armor) check when landing the blow. Failure destroys the hammer, disrupts the attempt to destroy the Tarnhelm, and deals 12d6 points of damage to the smith.
