In the shadowy land of Nidal, the influence of Zon-Kuthon and the Midnight Lord's favored servants-the kytons' taints the land and its inhabitants. Just as an eclipse drives animals wild, so too does the darkness unleash a madness from deep within you.

Bloodline Powers: The sadistic power of the kytons flows through you, twisting you into a creature of pain and darkness when you bloodrage.

Painful Strike (Su): At 1st level, when you confirm a critical hit, the target is sickened for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your bloodrager level (minimum 1). During this time, the creature must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + the spell's level) in order to cast a spell.

Grasping Chains (Su): At 4th level, chains cover your body and extend from your arms, grasping at the air around you and granting you a +4 bonus on Climb skill checks. At 9th level, this bonus increases to +8 and you gain a Climb speed equal to 1/2 your base speed.

Armor of Chains (Su): At 8th level, you gain resistance 5 to cold and the chains covering your body provide a +4 armor bonus to AC with no armor check penalty, maximum Dexterity bonus, or additional weight. At 16th level, the resistance increases to 10 and the armor bonus increases to +8.

Agony's Embrace (Su): At 12th level, whenever you're hit by a critical hit, your morale bonus to Strength from your bloodrage increases by 2 for 1d6 rounds or until your rage ends. The bonus to Strength instead increases by 4 at 16th level and by +6 at 20th level.

Unnerving Gaze (Su): At 16th level, your foes begin to see flashes of the faces of dead loved ones when they look at your face. You gain a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet. All foes who fail a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Charisma modifier) become shaken for 1d3 rounds.

Kyton Immunities (Su): At 20th level, you gain immunity to cold and DR 10/good and silver. You have this benefit constantly, even when not bloodraging.
