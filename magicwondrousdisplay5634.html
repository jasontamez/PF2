Description

A deathbalm talisman grants its wearer a +5 resistance bonus on Fortitude saves against disease or poison, and if placed around the neck of an individual already suffering the effects of poison or disease, it allows a new save (with no additional bonus from the deathbalm talisman) to immediately remove the affliction. Whenever a wearer successfully saves against the effects of disease or poison while wearing a deathbalm talisman, it becomes dormant for 24 hours. After this time has passed, it refreshes and functions again. A character who wears a functioning deathbalm talisman for a period of 24 hours heals 1d4 points of ability damage to any one ability score currently suffering ability damage.
