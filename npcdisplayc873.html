Tactics

Before Combat The druid casts liveoak and shambler on a regular basis, and always has a retinue of 1d4+2 advanced shambling mounds and a treant with her.
During Combat The druid detests trespassers. She begins combat by sending her shambling mounds and treant into melee and summoning a storm giant. She then summons a tyrannosaurus and casts animal growth on it, and spends the next few rounds buffing her summoned creatures with barkskin, mass cat's grace, and greater magic fang. She then casts offensive spells and drinks her potion of haste before wild shaping into a Huge elemental and moving into melee.

These dark nature priests do not nurture their home, but rather spread disease, filth, and hate throughout humanoid communities on behalf of an enraged and exploited landscape.
