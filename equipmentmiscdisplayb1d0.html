Description

These thick, fur-lined gloves have several internal pockets containing segmented packets of alchemical reagents that produce heat for 4 hours when broken and mixed. The wearer can massage the gloves to activate these heat packets as a full-round action. While the heat packets last, the wearer ignores the Strength and Dexterity penalties from the fatigued condition when performing Climb, Disable Device, and Sleight of Hand checks. Replacement heat packets cost 1 gp, and the heat packets in the gloves can be replaced with 1 minute of uninterrupted work.
