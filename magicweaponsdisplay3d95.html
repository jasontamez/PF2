Description

This special ability can only be added to a melee weapon. A courageous weapon fortifies the wielder's courage and morale in battle. The wielder gains a morale bonus on saving throws against fear equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus. In addition, any morale bonus on saving throws against fear the wielder gains from any other source is increased by half the weapon's enhancement bonus (minimum 1).
