Description

This narrow vial holds 5 doses of viscous liquid. When dripped
onto a willing creature's eyes, it gives the creature low-light
vision for 1 hour. The affected creature takes a -2 penalty on
saves against light-based spells and effects and gains the light
sensitivity weakness. A dose affects one creature, regardless of
how many eyes it has.
