Space-rending Spell - Phrenic Amplifications - Psychic







<a href="phrenicamplificationsdisplay899d.html?ItemName=Space-rending%20Spell">Space-rending Spell</a> (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 63</a>): The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as dimension door). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.

This is a major amplification.
