Most bards are inspired by the art of civilization, yet the voice of the wild's muse is the grandeur and beauty of nature. The voice of the wild has discovered some of nature's magical secrets, and can use his performance to bring out the bestial side in his allies.

Wild Knowledge (Ex):  At 1st level, a voice of the wild adds 1/2 his level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge (nature) checks. He can use Knowledge (geography) and Knowledge (nature) untrained. This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

Nature Magic:  At 1st level, a voice of the wild can select a 1st-level <a href="spellsa2e5.html?Class=Druid">druid</a> or <a href="spells9d8d.html?Class=Ranger">ranger</a> spell as a bard spell known instead of a spell from the bard spell list. The voice of the wild can select another druid or ranger spell (of any bard spell level he can cast) at 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels. If he chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, he can exchange a druid or ranger spell for another. This ability replaces countersong, all instances of versatile performance, and jack-of-all-trades.

Bardic Performance:  Voices of the wild gain the following bardic performance.

Song of the Wild (Su): At 3rd level, the voice of the wild can use bardic performance to grant an animal aspect to an ally, as if using the <a href="classdisplaye64c.html?ItemName=Hunter">hunter's animal focus class feature</a>. The ally must be able to hear or see the performance. The voice of the wild uses his bard level as his hunter level for determining the effect of the animal aspect. The bard can affect a second ally with this performance at 10th level and a third at 17th level. Song of the wild relies on audible or visual components. This ability replaces all increments of inspire competence, dirge of doom, and inspire heroics.
