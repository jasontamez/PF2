Dispelling Fist

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 97</a>
By focusing on your knowledge of magic and spells that negate its powers, you use your bare hands to rip magical defenses from your enemy.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +11, ability to cast dispel magic, caster level 7th.

Benefit:  If you have dispel magic prepared or can cast it spontaneously, you can cast it as a swift action after hitting an opponent with an unarmed strike. Treat this as a targeted dispel against the opponent you hit.
