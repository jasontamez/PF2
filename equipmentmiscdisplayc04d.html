Description

Sun cinder is a fine powder that glows faintly when exposed to light. One bag of this alchemically created talc contains 5 uses. When opened, it shines like a candle. If sprinkled on a torch or similar flame, 1 dose of sun cinder increases the light level of the area that flame illuminates by one additional step, up to bright light. This increased illumination lasts for 1 minute. Multiple doses of sun cinder can be used to further increase the light shed by the same source. A single dose of sun cinder does not affect flames larger than a torch. Sun cinder doesn't affect a light source's ability to penetrate magical darkness. Crafting 5 doses of sun cinder requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
