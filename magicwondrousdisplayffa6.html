Description

This item appears to be an unremarkable mesh bag with many small openings, but it is stuffed to overflowing with hay. It can be hung from a line, post, or tree limb and used to feed horses and ponies. It produces enough fresh feed for a number of horses or other similar mounts each day, as shown in the table below. <table class="inner"> <tr><td>Satchel Type</td><td>Satchel Weight</td><td>Mounts Fed/Day</td><td>Market Price</td></tr> <tr><td>I</td><td>15 lbs.</td><td>4</td><td>2,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>II</td><td>20 lbs.</td><td>10</td><td>4,000 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>III</td><td>25 lbs.</td><td>25</td><td>7,500 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>IV</td><td>30 lbs.</td><td>50</td><td>15,000 gp</td></tr></table>
