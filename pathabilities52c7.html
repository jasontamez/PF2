Mythic Path Abilities










1st-Tier Hierophant Path Abilities


When you ascend to mythic power with the Starstone, you most likely gain tiers of the hierophant path and can entreat a deity for aid, swearing to further her goals in return for a measure of her power. The deity might immediately accept or reject you. If you're accepted, you can take the 1st-tier divine patron hierophant path ability below. If you're rejected, after 24 hours you can petition a different deity or chose a different ability (or even a different mythic path, if you wish).

<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Divine Patron (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy90q7?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Mythic-Realms">Mythic Realms pg. 16</a>): When you encounter a creature who serves your sworn deity, treat its attitude as one step better. When you cast divine spells upon yourself or another creature who serves your deity, treat your caster level as 2 higher.

In addition, every deity grants a modified version of a 3rd-tier hierophant ability (see following page). You must select this path ability in order to gain the additional benefits; it is not automatically granted. If you already have mythic power and the listed ability upon taking divine patron, the other ability immediately turns into its modified version. In addition, a deity grants access to an ability from another path that ref lects its interests and power.</td>
