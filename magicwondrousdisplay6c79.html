Description

The traditional robes of the runelord of greed are known as the robes of Xin-Shalast. Rarely, a runelord would grant a favored apprentice a set of these robes. Woven of the finest of silks and accented with precious gemstones and gold, the robes are surprisingly light and easy to move in. Robes of Xin-Shalast aid and accentuate their wearer's spellcasting ability. They grant a +6 armor bonus and spell resistance 24, but also cause the wearer to cast all spells at +1 caster level. Two of the robe's pockets function as handy haversacks. The wearer of these robes is immune to the effects of the occluding field that surrounds the Spires of Xin-Shalast, and can exist comfortably in all high altitudes, including within the death zone at altitudes of 26,000 feet and higher.
