You create a terrifying display of elemental power. This ability functions as <a href="featdisplay9665.html?ItemName=">Dazzling Display</a>, except you can use this ability as a standard action and you add half your kineticist level as a bonus on your Intimidate check if you've used gather power during the same round; doing so expends the gathered power. This ability otherwise counts as the <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a> feat; feats and other effects which affect <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a> (such as <a href="featdisplaybc83.html?ItemName=Shatter%20Defenses">Shatter Defenses</a>) apply to it, and it counts as <a href="featdisplay9665.html?ItemName=">Dazzling Display</a> for the purpose of meeting combat feat prerequisites.
