Carrion Sense (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have a natural ability to sniff out carrion. This functions like the scent ability, but only for corpses and badly wounded creatures (creatures with 25% or fewer hit points).

Darkvision 60 Feet (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

Darkvision 120 Feet (3 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race can see in the dark up to 120 feet.

Deepsight (2 RP): Prerequisite: Amphibious racial trait; Benefit: Members of this race are specially adapted to the lightless depths of the oceans, but not to air-filled environments. They can see in the dark up to 120 feet while underwater, but do not gain this benefit out of water.

Low-Light Vision (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race can see twice as far as a race with normal vision in conditions of dim light.

Minesight (2 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have darkvision 90 feet; however, they are automatically dazzled in bright light and take a -2 penalty on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor.

Water Sense (1 RP): Prerequisite: Outsider (native) with ties to the Plane of Water or amphibious racial trait; Benefit: Members of this race can sense vibrations in water, granting them blindsense 30 feet against creatures that are touching the same body of water.

Scent (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race gain the scent ability (Bestiary 304).

See in Darkness (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by spells such as <a href="spelldisplay6b85.html?ItemName=deeper%20darkness">deeper darkness</a>.

All-Around Vision (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have some way of seeing all around them, granting them a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks and making them immune to flanking.

Blindsense 30 Feet (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Using nonvisual senses such as acute smell or hearing, members of this race notice things they cannot see. Members of this race usually do not need to make Perception checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within 30 feet, provided they have line of effect to that creature. A creature that members of this race cannot see still has total concealment against individuals with blindsense, and members of this race still have the normal miss chance when attacking creatures that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of members of this race. Members of this race are still denied their Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks from creatures they cannot see.
