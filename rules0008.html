Not all fleshwarping is intentional. On occasion, creatures are exposed to environmental hazards that replicate the adverse results of fleshwarping with less grace and precision than the alchemical and magical process of true fleshwarping. Areas of intense magical radiation, alchemical pollution, wild magic, and corrupted ley lines all might cause spontaneous fleshwarp mutations, and in the presence of supremely alien creatures such as the <a href="monsterfamilies287c.html?ItemName=Great%20Old%20One">Great Old Ones</a>, the laws of reality can break down and sometimes create a similar effect, resulting in severe mutation and disfigurement.

Fleshwarp mutations come at an even higher cost to the target's health, sanity, and life span than intentional fleshwarping. Fleshwarp mutations become more severe with greater exposure. Early mutations are typically cosmetic and act as a sign of something unnatural. Advanced fleshwarp mutations are always detrimental, causing physical and mental trauma to the creature.

Fleshwarp mutations progress similarly to <a href="rules04d3.html?Name=Corruptions&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">corruptions</a>, so at the GM's discretion, spells or effects that help against corruptions might also apply to them.

Acquiring Fleshwarp Mutations: Any long-term magical hazard can potentially carry the risk of fleshwarp mutation. Exposure to polluted alchemical labs, vile curses, bizarre rituals, wild magic zones, and cursed magic items are all good examples of fleshwarp mutations sources. A source of fleshwarp mutation is a hazard and is assigned a corresponding CR that reflects its relative severity.

For every hour a living creature is exposed to a fleshwarp mutation source, that creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + the CR of the corruptive source). Success means the creature has fought off the fleshwarping effects for the time being. On the first failed save, the exposed creature immediate gains an early fleshwarp mutation (see Table 5-1) and takes 1d3 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d6 points of sanity damage, if using the <a href="rules0b4f.html?Name=Sanity&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">sanity system</a>) due to the sudden and horrific nature of the metamorphosis. The second failed saving throw while the creature is within the same area increases the severity of the mutation. The creature gains an advanced mutation (see Table 5-2), and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (or 2d4 points of sanity damage). Once a creature has at least one advanced mutation, further exposure within the same area causes another advanced mutation on a failed save. However, this level of physical deformity is extremely taxing on a mutated creature, and each subsequent new mutation imposes a cumulative -2 penalty to the creature's Constitution score as long as the fleshwarped creature has the mutation. If the total penalties from mutations are greater than or equal to a character's normal Constitution score, its body can't support all the conflicting mutations, and it either dies or spontaneously warps into a mad, horrific creature.

Fleshwarp mutation effects are transmutation effects, and may also be poison effects based on the nature of the corruption causing the mutations. All mutations are extraordinary abilities. Fleshwarp mutations can be healed with curative magic. <a href="spelldisplayc2fb.html?ItemName=restoration,%20lesser">Lesser restoration</a>, <a href="spelldisplay1364.html?ItemName=restoration">restoration</a>, or greater healing magic can remove all early fleshwarp mutations. <a href="spelldisplay7255.html?ItemName=restoration,%20greater">Greater restoration</a>, <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a>, or <a href="spelldisplay1364.html?ItemName=restoration">restoration</a> can remove all advanced fleshwarp mutations.
