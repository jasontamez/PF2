Description

This 5-foot-square cloth canopy is brightly colored with gold fringe around the edges, something a slightly foppish sultan might use while resting on the seashore. When you speak the command word, the canopy unfolds and floats 3 feet above your head, positioning itself to keep you shaded. The travel canopy cannot hold any weight. It reverts to its 1-foot-square folded form at your command, or automatically when it is out of the sun for more than 1 minute.
