Description

Crafted from brass and polished quartz, these expensive bifocals grant the wearer a +5 bonus on Appraise checks, and on Linguistics or Perception checks to detect a forgery. However, after they have been worn for 1 week, they begin distorting the wearer's perception of value, replacing this bonus with a -10 penalty on the same checks. This penalty persists even when a victim is not wearing the spendthrift spectacles. Whenever the wearer is making a purchase that costs more than 10 gp, he must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be compelled to make extravagant offers and pay outrageous prices (1d10 ?? 10% more than the asking price) for the item, paying with coin and valuables if available, or bartering with other equipment if not.
