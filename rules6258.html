The passage of time is always subjective for the viewer. This subjectivity applies to various planes: travelers may discover that they gain or lose time while moving between planes, but from their point of view, time always passes normally.



Normal Time

This is the baseline for time flow, and describes the passage of time on the Material Plane; 1 hour on a plane with normal time equals 1 hour on the Material Plane.



Erratic Time

Some planes have time that slows down and speeds up, so an individual may lose or gain time as he moves between such planes and any others. To creatures present on such a plane, time flows normally and the shifts are unnoticed. The following is provided as an example of how time on a plane with erratic time might compare to time on the Material Plane.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>d%</td><td>Time on Material Plane</td><td>Time on Erratic Time Plane</td></tr> <tr><td>01-10</td><td>1 day</td><td>1 round</td></tr> <tr><td>11-40</td><td>1 day</td><td>1 hour</td></tr> <tr><td>41-60</td><td>1 day</td><td>1 day</td></tr> <tr><td>61-90</td><td>1 hour</td><td>1 day</td></tr> <tr><td>91-100</td><td>1 round</td><td>1 day</td></tr> </table>



Flowing Time

On some planes, the flow of time is consistently faster or slower. An individual may spend a year on such a plane and then return to the Material Plane to find that only 6 seconds have elapsed. When indicating how time works on planes with flowing time, the Material Plane's flow of time is listed first, followed by the flow in the other plane.



Timeless

On planes with this trait, time still passes but the effects of time are diminished. How the timeless trait affects certain activities or conditions such as hunger, thirst, aging, afflictions, and healing varies from plane to plane. The danger of a timeless plane is that once an individual leaves such a plane for one where time flows normally, conditions such as hunger and aging apply retroactively. If a plane is timeless with respect to magic, any spell cast with a duration other than instantaneous is permanent until dispelled.
