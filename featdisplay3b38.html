You intimidate weaker allies into reckless ferocity.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayebdb.html?ItemName=Demoralizing%20Lash">Demoralizing Lash</a>, Intimidate 5 ranks, hobgoblin.

Benefit:  As a standard action, you spur an ally, who must have fewer Hit Dice than yourself, to reckless effort. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves against mind-affecting effects. However, the ally also takes a -2 penalty to AC and on skill checks. To affect an unwilling ally, you must succeed at an Intimidate check with the same DC used to demoralize your ally.

Special:  If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, the morale bonus increases to +2.
