Description

This +2 shock musket is inscribed with imagery of storms and plagues, glorifying the daemonic harbinger Cixyron. When a bullet fired from a withershot strikes a good- or neutral-aligned target, it burrows into the target's flesh and infects the target with cackle fever (Core Rulebook 557). Infected creatures can resist the disease normally, but can't be cured or recover lost ability damage until the cursed bullet is removed (this requires a successful DC 15 Heal check or a restoration spell). Additional bullet impacts do not increase the effects, but each bullet must be removed before the target can be cured of its disease.
