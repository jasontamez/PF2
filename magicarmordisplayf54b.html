Description

This +1 chainmail looks like something a talentless dwarven apprentice would make-ugly, asymmetrical, and finished quickly rather than with care. The wearer gains a luck bonus or penalty equal to 1d6-3 on Craft checks to make armor or weapons while wearing it. This bonus or penalty is determined the first time the wearer attempts such a Craft check to determine a day's progress. If the wearer removes the armor, this bonus or penalty persists for an additional 24 hours. Once per day, the wearer can use magic weapon.
