Description

These vambraces are constructed of polished steel. When a
paladin wears these vambraces, engravings of the holy symbol
of a paladin's deity and other religious iconography mystically
appear upon the metal's surface. Once per day, when the
paladin uses her lay on hands ability, she can choose to apply
an additional mercy to that use of lay on hands that she did not
already select. She must be of sufficient level to use that mercy.
