Description

The oaken plates of this +1 wild wooden armor are rough with untreated bark. The wearer can activate the armor with a command word, causing her flesh to become treelike in appearance and resilience. This grants the wearer a +4 enhancement bonus to her existing natural armor bonus and removes her need to breathe, but reduces her speed by half and imposes a -2 penalty on Reflex saves. This effect remains until dismissed as a free action. The wearer can use this ability for up to 10 rounds per day, though the rounds need not be consecutive.
