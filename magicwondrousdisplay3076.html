Description

This amulet features a large, ragged stone that was harvested from highly radioactive regions of the Darklands and that glows with a faint green light. The wearer is rendered immune to the effects of all forms of radiation. Additionally, for each minute the wearer is exposed to radiation, the amulet absorbs 1 charge of radioactive energy. The amulet can hold up to 5 charges. Charges naturally dissipate at a rate of 1 charge per 24 hours. As a standard action, the wearer can expend 1 charge in order to fire a ray of concentrated radiation from the amulet. Treat this as a ranged touch attack with a range of 60 feet. The wearer can choose any one of the following effects, as outlined below.

Blightburn: The target takes 6d6 points of fire damage.

Caphorite: The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.

Lazurite: The target takes 2d6 points of negative energy damage, and if it dies in the next hour, there is a 50% chance it rises as a ghoul 1d4 rounds later.

Surface: The target takes 1d2 points of Strength and Constitution damage.
