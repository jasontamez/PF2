You can change shape more quickly than most kitsune.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, base attack bonus +6, kitsune.

Benefit:  You can assume human or kitsune form as a swift action. If you have the Fox Shape feat, you can assume fox form as a swift action as well.

Normal:  A kitsune's change shape ability is a standard action.
