Some monsters are best used in groups or with other creatures that complement or augment their abilities. A single derro probably has a hard time using its sneak attack, but a group of them can easily set up flanking situations. Tieflings have fire resistance 5, making them handy allies for a fire priest with <a href="spelldisplay3e9a.html?ItemName=burning%20hands">burning hands</a> or a fire mephit; alternatively, a tiefling cleric controlling a gang of burning skeletons is all but immune to their area damage. Creatures with spell-like abilities can cast them on minions or on a leader. For example, a dark naga or spirit naga can cast <a href="spelldisplayfa8f.html?ItemName=cat%e2%80%99s%20grace">cat's grace</a>, <a href="spelldisplay749c.html?ItemName=invisibility">invisibility</a>, or <a href="spelldisplayf8fb.html?ItemName=displacement">displacement</a> on its allies; a spirit naga can even turn itself invisible and cast cure spells on its allies. Given time, a succubus's profane gift ability can bolster every single guard, priest, and lieutenant in an evil fortress.

Monster abilities can also complement hazards or traps; a flying monster ignores difficult terrain, floor pits, or patches of green slime. Monsters with damage reduction are immune to arrow traps and most spear traps; those immune to poison can ignore the danger of poisonous traps or even rooms with inherently toxic air, such as a sulfurous volcanic vent. Using monsters intelligently like this helps create fun and memorable encounters, as well as challenges PCs to try new tactics.
