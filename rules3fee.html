At these levels, your fear begins to overwhelm you.

4. Frightened: You are so afraid that you must flee from the source of your fear. On your turn, you must move away from any source of fear you perceive. Once you can no longer perceive any source of fear, you can act as normal, but you still take all the penalties of the shaken condition. You can use special abilities, such as spells and equipment, to flee and must resort to such abilities if they seem like the only way to escape. If you flee from the source of your fear and it later reappears while you are still frightened, you must immediately begin fleeing again. If unable to flee, you can fight.

5. Panicked: This functions as the frightened condition, but you drop anything held whenever you are forced to flee and you flee in a random direction. In addition, you treat all sources of danger as fear sources and must flee from them as well. If unable to flee, you cower in fear.

6. Terrified: This functions as panicked, but you do not treat any other character as an ally and thus must attempt saving throws against spells that allow them, even if the spells are beneficial. If unable to flee, you cower in fear. In addition, once you have fled from fear, you do not act as normal. Instead, each round you roll on the following table to determine your course of action.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>d%</td><td>Result</td></tr> <tr><td>01-25</td><td>Continue to flee, moving away from any known source of danger.</td></tr> <tr><td>26-50</td><td>Find a place nearby to hide, using Stealth as normal. You do nothing until you are discovered (and forced to run again) or you are no longer terrified.</td></tr> <tr><td>51-75</td><td>Lash out at the nearest creature, even an ally, attacking it with whatever weapon is available.</td></tr> <tr><td>76-100</td><td>Do nothing. If you get this result in two consecutive rounds, you no longer need to roll on this chart starting on the third round and can act as normal unless you encounter a source of fear or danger, in which case you are still terrified and act accordingly.</td></tr> </table>

7. Horrified: You are transfixed with fear and can take no actions. You take a -2 penalty to your AC, are flat-footed (even if you normally cannot be), and are considered helpless.
