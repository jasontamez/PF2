Description

This platinum key can open nearly any lock or door with a mere
touch. With a touch of the key, a lock of DC 40 or lower unlocks.
When a creature holding the key attempts to break down a
door with a break (locked) DC of 28 or lower, the door is broken
and opened. In all other cases it grants the creature possessing
Perfection's Key a +10 bonus on Disable Device checks to pick
locks, and a +10 bonus on attempts to break down doors.

Destruction

Somewhere in the planes there is said to be an Impossible
Lock-a mechanism so perfect that only this key can thwart it. If
Perfection's Key is inserted into the Impossible Lock, the key is
destroyed, but unlocks the Impossible Lock.
