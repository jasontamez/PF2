You can overwhelm large foes with sheer numbers.


Benefit:  You are considered to be flanking an opponent
if at least one ally who also has this feat is threatening that
opponent and the opponent is at least two size categories
larger than the larger of you or your ally, regardless of your
actual positioning.


Normal:  You must be positioned opposite an ally to
flank an opponent.
