Description

Not all underwater creatures use sight as their primary means of reading text, so underwater paper is significantly thicker than surface paper, allowing the writer to carve the letters into the sheet. This lets creatures with blindsight see the textured writing from afar as well as allowing others to read it by touch, or sometimes from a short distance if they have unusually precise tremorsense. For underwater societies where vision is more prominent, the writer can fill the carved grooves with colorful ink (and potentially bioluminescent ink) and then adhere a transparent waterproof sheet on top to prevent the ink from washing away. This transparent sheet costs an additional 4 sp.
