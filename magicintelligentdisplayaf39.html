Description

This intelligent item is called a lightning bow by mortals, a
name is seen as a slight to the lightning elemental trapped
within it-a creature honor-bound to serve in the bow for no
less than 100 years. Each of these +3 adaptive composite
longbows is a haughty and often highly intelligent member
of its race, who chides those who don’t know its true name-
which is often a complicated series of high pitched squeaks,
like live wood burning on a pyre. The elemental in a lightning
bow only speaks Auran. Lightning bows will not fire on other
outsiders with the elemental subtype. Some are also bound
not to attack other individuals, based on their history. For
instance, one of these bows might be foresworn not to attack
the Sultan of Fire, fire giants, or red dragons. Additionally,
lightning bows have the following powers.
<ul><li>A lightning bow needs no ammunition. With the pull of a
string, it creates a +3 shock arrow or a +3 brilliant energy
arrow (the wielder’s choice with each shot).
</li><li>Three times per day, the wielder can cast true strike as a
swift action. The true strike can only be used with attacks
made with the lightning bow.
</li><li>Three times per day, the wielder can use lightning bolt as a
spell-like ability.</li></ul>
