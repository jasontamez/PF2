The creature (which must be at least Large) can catch Small, Medium, or Large rocks (or similar projectiles). Once per round, a creature that would normally be hit by a rock can attempt a Reflex save to catch it as a free action. The DC is 15 for a Small rock, 20 for a Medium rock, and 25 for a Large rock. (If the projectile provides a magical bonus on attack rolls, the DC increases by that amount.) The creature must be aware of the attack in order to use rock catching.
