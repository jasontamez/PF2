Sometimes a player may split off from the group, or you might want to give information secretly to a certain player because of a successful Perception check. Perhaps an NPC only trusts one character enough to impart her dangerous secret, or the players suspect a traitor in their midst. Similarly, sometimes a player may seek to give you information privately, especially if she's working on her own secret agenda or a rogue attempting to steal from her companions. In instances where you need to box out most of your party, there are several options.

Simply taking the player aside and leaving the room, or passing a note, is perfectly adequate, but knowing another player is getting secret knowledge often eats at other players and can tempt even the most steadfast gamer into metagaming. Talking to the player in question between game sessions is a far safer option, but isn't always possible. Though there are any number of sneaky ways to let a player know something important without alerting the rest of the party-for instance, covertly sending them a text message if you allow cell phones at the table-in general the best way to handle secrets is to either flat-out ask your players to respect the fact that they don't know a given piece of information, or-better still-manipulate the game to avoid the need for intraparty secrets altogether. And remember that any time you spend with one player is time you aren't spending with the rest.
