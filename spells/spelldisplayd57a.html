Description

By performing part of the Chelish opera Victory of the Hellknights, you call forth spectral illusions of mounted Hellknights to trample your foes under the hooves of their glorious steeds. The shadowy knights appear in an adjacent 10-foot square and ride forward in the direction you indicate, dealing 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all creatures in their path. Half of this damage is cold damage, while half results directly from arcane power and is not subject to cold resistance or immunity. The knights cannot pass through force effects or barriers that block incorporeal creatures or undead.

Mythic Dirge of the Victorious Knights

The damage increases to 1d10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 20d10). Any creature that fails its Reflex saving throw is knocked prone, and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.

Augmented (7th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the area increases to a 240-foot line 20 feet wide. All cold damage dealt by the spell ignores cold resistance and cold immunity.
