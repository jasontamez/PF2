Longstrider, Greater

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 186</a>
School <a href="spelldefinitionsfc86.html?ID=8">transmutation</a>; Level druid 3, hunter 3, ranger 3

Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (a pinch of dirt)

Effect

Range personal
Target you
Duration 1 hour/level (D)

Description

This functions as longstrider, except it gives you a foot enhancement bonus to your base speed and a foot enhancement bonus to your other modes of movement (burrow, climb, fly, swim, and so on). It does not affect movement modes you do not actually have-for example, if you do not have a swim speed, this spell does not grant you a swim speed.
