Description

With a touch, you cause the victim of this spell to suffer a painful curse that causes it to grow hideously disfigured. The physical appearance of the deformity is subject to the caster's whim (most demon worshipers choose deformities that reflect their Abyssal patron's shape or form). The target takes one of the following penalties.  <ul><li>-2 decrease to an ability score (minimum 1). </li><li>-2 penalty on attack rolls or saving throws. </li><li>Land speed reduced by 5 feet. </li></ul> You may also invent other effects, but they should be no more powerful than those described above.

Mythic Disfiguring Touch

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 91</a>
The target takes two different penalties (chosen from the same list) instead of one.

Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target also gains the fatigued condition because of its painful disfigurement. If this fatigue is negated without removing the curse, it returns after 1 hour.
