Description

You are able to harness the power of the storm to transport yourself a short distance, by taking the form of a furious, sizzling bolt of elemental electricity. You must either have line of sight to your destination or you must specify a direction and distance within range. Creatures and objects in the path of your passage take 1d8 points of electricity damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8). A successful Reflex save halves the damage.

If your path intersects with a solid object, you damage the barrier accordingly. If the damage is enough to break through the barrier, you continue beyond the barrier as long as the spell's range permits; otherwise, your movement stops in the square adjacent to the barrier and the effect ends.
