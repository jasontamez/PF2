Description

Created by Ghorus when he was working to create the <a href="racesdisplaya15c.html?ItemName=Ghoran">ghorans</a>, pinecone bomb infuses a small pinecone with power, causing it to detonate with explosive force when thrown. You throw the pinecone at a target or point within range and it detonates immediately upon landing, dealing 1d6 points of piercing damage per 2 caster levels you have (maximum 5d6) to each creature caught in the spread.
