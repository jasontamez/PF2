Description

The object becomes flawed and prone to failure. The effects of this spell depend on the nature of the object.

Magic Item: The item functions intermittently, gaining either an unreliable curse or a random dependent curse (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 536).

Nonmagical Armor or Shield: The item gains the fragile armor quality (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 8).

Nonmagical Weapon: The item gains the fragile weapon quality (Ultimate Equipment 22).

Tool: The item gains the broken condition if a creature rolls a natural 1 while making a skill check with the tool.

Other Item: Each day it is used, the item has a 5% chance of gaining the broken condition.

This spell does not affect artifacts. The item can be sold or discarded as normal (the bearer is not compelled to keep it). If a cleric of Groetus is using an item that is affected by this spell, he or she may make a DC 20 Will saving throw to override the item's curse for 1 day (using it as if the item were not cursed).
