Description

By magically altering the way your vocal cords create sounds,
you can emulate the vocal inflections of dragons. This grants
a +6 circumstance bonus on Charisma checks and Charismarelated
skill checks when dealing with dragons.

In addition, your voice is much louder than normal, halving
the penalties to others' Perception checks to hear you due to
distance, intervening doors, and so on.
