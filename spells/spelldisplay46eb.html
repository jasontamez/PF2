Description

The spell forces the target to believe that nothing in its hoard
is missing or has been disturbed. This spell fools all the senses,
convincing the target that its hoard feels and behaves as it
should. Only if the target tries to use an item from this illusory
hoard for some other purpose does it receive another saving
throw to disbelieve the effects of the spell (a wizard trying to
use an illusory wand or a dragon trying to unlock a door with
an illusory key). For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any
amount of treasure that is too big to be carried by the treasure's
owner without magical tools such as bags of holding or portable
holes, such as a dragon's hoard, a king's treasury, a merchant's
strongbox, or a thief's hidden cache.

The material component is any item worth 10 gp or more taken
from the original hoard. This item is consumed by the spell.
