Description

You push your hand into the subject, then withdraw an affliction from the body of the sufferer as a tangible object. This extraction appears as a slimy mass of flesh. The target creature is cured as if affected by remove disease, remove curse, or neutralize poison.

In addition, this slimy mass allows you to deliver the affliction to another as a touch attack, as if holding the charge for a touch spell. It has the same effect as the original affliction, with the same saving throw and DC.
