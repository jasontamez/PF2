Description

This spell functions as symbol of death, except that, when triggered, it creates a scrying sensor linked to you and centered on the symbol, even if you are on a different plane than the symbol. You are immediately aware that the symbol has been triggered if you are conscious, and are awakened from normal sleep if sleeping. The symbol does not otherwise disturb your concentration. You may observe the area through the symbol as if using a scrying spell with the sensor as the target creature. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

Unlike symbol of death, a symbol of scrying is not considered a magical trap. Symbol of scrying can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 13th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.
