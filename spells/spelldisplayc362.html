Description

You implant a mental mine within your psyche that triggers against anyone attempting to manipulate your thoughts. Any creature that uses a mind-affecting effect against you triggers the mine, causing psychic backlash against the offending creature. This backlash deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) and staggers the target for 1d4 rounds. If the target succeeds at a Will saving throw, it takes only half damage and negates the staggered effect. The mine does not disrupt the mind-affecting effect that triggered the spell. You can use a swift action to suppress the trigger of your mine for 1 round to allow someone to use a mind-affecting effect on you. You can have only one mental mine active at a time.

Effect

Duration 1 hour/level or until discharged
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance no

Description

This functions as per animus mine, except the triggering creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds instead of staggered. If the target succeeds at a Will saving throw, it takes only half damage and negates the stunned effect. If the target fails this Will saving throw, you automatically succeed at any saving throw against the mind-affecting effect that triggered the mine.
