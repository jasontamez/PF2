Description

When you cast this spell, a wind spirit envelopes you and carries you with it at your direction. You gain a foot enhancement bonus to your base speed and fly speed while this spell is in effect. If you don't have a fly speed, you instead gain a fly speed of 10 feet with poor maneuverability. If your caster level is 10th-14th, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is  feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 20 feet with average maneuverability). If your caster level is 15th or higher, the enhancement bonus to these speeds is  feet (if applicable, your temporary fly speed is 30 feet with average maneuverability).
