Description

You gain a brief but incomplete understanding of one book's
contents, equivalent to having skimmed its pages for 1
hour. This insight is not sufficient to translate unknown
languages, decipher codes, or memorize text, but it
does allow the caster to learn what topics the book discusses'
invaluable to a Pathfinder who must make a snap decision when
performing research or deciding whether or not to abscond with
a volume. In addition, you instantly benefit from any bonuses or
effects the book would normally grant to anyone who reads it for
1 hour (such as the bonuses gained from reading volumes of the
Pathfinder Chronicles; see pages 26-27).
