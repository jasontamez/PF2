Description

You emit a calming subsonic drone that allows the targets to temporarily refocus and restore their balance when they're suffering from debilitating conditions. A target with the dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition ignores the penalties of those conditions for the duration of this spell. A target with one of the following conditions is treated as having the associated lesser condition for the duration of the spell, as shown by the following table.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Condition</td><td>Lesser Condition</td></tr> <tr><td>Blinded</td><td>Dazzled</td></tr> <tr><td>Exhausted</td><td>Fatigued</td></tr> <tr><td>Frightened</td><td>Shaken</td></tr> <tr><td>Nauseated</td><td>Sickened</td></tr></table>
At the end of the spell's duration, the targets are again subject to the appropriate penalties if the original conditions affecting the target are still in effect.
