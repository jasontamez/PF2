Description

You imbue your armor with a righteous aura. It gains a +1 enhancement bonus per four caster levels (maximum +5 at 20th level). When using your judgment or smite ability, you gain DR 5/evil.

An outfit of regular clothing counts as armor that grants no AC bonus for the purpose of this spell.

You gain DR 5/evil while wearing the target armor. While you're using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/evil.

Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a sacred bonus.
