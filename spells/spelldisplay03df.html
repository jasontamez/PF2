Description

Followers of <a href="deitydisplayea52.html?ItemName=Arazni">Arazni</a> have made use of this litany since her days as a crusader and herald. Each time the target creature takes piercing or slashing damage, it takes 1 point of bleed damage; this bleed damage stacks with itself. While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.
