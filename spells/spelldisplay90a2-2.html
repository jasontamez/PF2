Description

You imbue the target with an army special ability (see page 242
of Ultimate Campaign) possessed by the army's commander.
The army is treated as if it consists of units who all possess
the chosen special ability. This special ability is in addition to
any special abilities the army inherently possessed prior to the
casting of the spell.
