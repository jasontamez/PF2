Description

Each round you can roll an inspiration die without expending a use of inspiration and gain the result as a dodge bonus to AC for that round. You are immune to precision damage (including the extra damage from the precise strike deed, sneak attack, studied combat, and studied strike).

If a critical hit is confirmed against you, you can dismiss this spell as an immediate action to negate the critical and make the attack instead deal normal damage.
