Description

With a tirade against deceit, you strip the target of any illusions cloaking it. Any illusion spells or effects affecting the target are suppressed for the spell's duration. In addition, the target can't benefit from concealment.

While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.
