Description

Upon casting this spell, you conjure forth one or two balls of flame, each resting in a free hand. As part of casting this spell or as a standard action, you can throw one flame ball a maximum of 300 feet, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level you have (maximum 10d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius spread.

So long as the spell's duration lasts, you can channel your anger as a full-round action to create one new ball of flame, which can be thrown as a standard action. You cannot create additional balls of flame while you are under the effects of a calm emotions spell or are otherwise unable to feel anger or outrage.
