Description

You send out a magical message to any eldritch entities of a particular kind within a 100-mile radius, which can be delivered to up to 20 such creatures, starting with the nearest creatures until the limit has been met. This spell can't contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can't send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar contact entity spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don't know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn't call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.

How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn's overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like scrying, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.

Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table.<table class="inner"><tr><td>Contact Entity I</td><td>Material Component</td></tr><tr><td>Cerebric fungus</td><td>Scholarly tome</td><tr><tr><td>Deep one</td><td>Engraved stone tablet</td><tr><tr><td>Grioth</td><td>An eye struck blind during an eclipse [evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Nightgaunt</td><td>Sculpture of an animal with the face filed smooth [chaotic]</td><tr><tr><td>Ratling</td><td>Spell scroll of 1st level or higher [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Voonith</td><td>Bundle of cattail plants [chaotic]</td><tr><tr><td>Contact Entity II</td><td>Material Component</td></tr><tr><td>Colour out of space</td><td>Shard of a meteorite</td><tr><tr><td>Denizen of Leng</td><td>Painting of a memory from a dream worth 1,000 gp</td><tr><tr><td>Elder thing</td><td>Magic item or piece of technology worth 2,000 gp</td><tr><tr><td>Hound of Tindalos</td><td>Exotic, trance-inducing elixir worth 500 gp</td><tr><tr><td>Leng ghoul</td><td>Skull of a dead scholar</td><tr><tr><td>Mi-go</td><td>Fresh brains of an intelligent creature [evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Neh-thalggu</td><td>Vial of cerebrospinal fluid from a creature that still lives [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Rhu-chalik</td><td>Brain of a creature that had 16 Int or higher [evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Shantak</td><td>A shard of rock harvested from another world [chaotic]</td><tr><tr><td>Yangethe</td><td>Scroll of an emotion spell of 4th level or higher</td><tr><tr><td>Contact Entity III</td><td>Material Component</td></tr><tr><td>Aatheriexa</td><td>A swatch of flesh recently damaged by magic [evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Deep one elder</td><td>Engraved stone tablet</td><tr><tr><td>Flying polyp</td><td>Eerie music played upon a wind instrument carved from the bone of a living creature [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Gug</td><td>Fresh flesh of a creature of 5 HD or more [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Leng spider</td><td>Head of a denizen of Leng [evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Moon-beast</td><td>Intelligent humanoid sacrificed while dreaming [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Spawn of Yog-Sothoth</td><td>All blood drained from a sacrificed intelligent humanoid [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Wendigo</td><td>Must devour the flesh of sentient creatures with 8 HD total [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Yithian</td><td>Quartz geode</td><tr><tr><td>Contact Entity IV</td><td>Material Component</td></tr><tr><td>Bhole</td><td>Jar of slime created by a bhole's breath weapon</td><tr><tr><td>Bodythief</td><td>Chunks of brain from a lobotomy subject [evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Neothelid</td><td>Ruby worth 3,000 gp [chaotic, evil]</td><tr><tr><td>Shoggoth</td><td>Art object worth 3,000 gp recovered from the bottom of a sea [chaotic]</td><tr><tr><td>Star-spawn of Cthulhu</td><td>Sacrificed humanoid of 10 HD or more [chaotic, evil]</td><tr></table>
