Description

You instantly teleport a building in a settlement you control to
another lot or series of lots in the same settlement district. The
building to be teleported must be unoccupied, and the area
to which you wish to move the building must be cleared and
unoccupied during the casting of this spell. A building cannot be
teleported to an area it would not normally be able to occupy,
such as an area adjacent to a prohibited building type. If you
don't wholly own the structure, all of the structure's owners
must consent to the structure's teleportation before the spell is
cast; otherwise, it fails immediately.


This spell only functions on buildings that occupy a number
of lots equal to one-fourth your caster level (so, for instance, a
16th-level caster could use this spell on a building that occupies
up to 4 lots).
