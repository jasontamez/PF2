Description

You blur the lines between mind and body, reassigning ability damage or drain your target has taken to a corresponding ability score, as per the following table.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Physical Ability Score</td><td>Mental Ability Score</td></tr> <tr><td>Strength</td><td>Intelligence</td></tr> <tr><td>Dexterity</td><td>Wisdom</td></tr> <tr><td>Constitution</td><td>Charisma</td></tr></table>
The transfer of damage can go either way-you can convert Intelligence damage to Strength damage and vice versa. You can transfer any number of points of damage or drain in a single casting, though only from one ability score to the corresponding ability score. You cannot transfer enough ability damage or drain to reduce an ability score to 0.
