Description

This spell causes any existing wounds that the target possesses to bleed profusely. If the creature's current total hit points are less than its maximum, this spell causes the creature to take 1 point of bleed damage each round and become exhausted for the duration of the spell. A successful DC 15 Heal check or any spell that cures hit point damage negates the effects of this spell.
