Description

You gift the target with the ability to perfect its actions via mental clarity. On the next attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check the target attempts, it rolls twice and takes the more favorable result. For every 5 caster levels you have, the target can roll twice on an additional attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check (to a maximum of 5 rolls at 20th level).

Hermean potential is countered and dispelled by ill omen, but does not itself counter or dispel ill omen.
