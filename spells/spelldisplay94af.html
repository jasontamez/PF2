Description

Upon casting this spell, you permanently rearrange and resize the
rooms in a building you constructed as a downtime activity (see
page 84 of Ultimate Campaign). You may reorganize and remap
the building however you please, as if each room had just been
constructed and is being positioned for the first time. You cannot
make any changes to a building that changes how much a room
would cost to create or that alters the benefits a room provides.
The structure also must remain in the same general position
within the district. If you don't wholly own the structure, all of
the structure's owners must consent to the changes being made
before the spell is cast; otherwise, it fails immediately.
