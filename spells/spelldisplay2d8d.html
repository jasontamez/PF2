Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance  no


Description

This spell functions like lesser angelic aspect, except you gain lowlight
vision; darkvision 60 feet; DR 10/evil; immunity to acid, cold,
and petrification; resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10; a +4 racial
bonus on saves against poison; and protective aura and truespeech
as supernatural abilities for the duration of the spell. Also, your
wings give you a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability.

Protective aura provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4
resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects
created by evil creatures to anyone within 20 feet. Otherwise,
it functions as a magic circle against evil and a lesser globe of
invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet.

Truespeech allows you to speak with any creature that has a
language, as though using the tongues spell.
