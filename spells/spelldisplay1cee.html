Description

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount's abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

8th Level: The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

10th Level: The mount can use water walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

12th Level: The mount can use air walk at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

14th Level: The mount can fly at its speed with a bonus on Fly skill checks equal to your caster level.

Mythic Phantom Steed

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 103</a>
The steed's rider automatically succeeds at Ride checks to remain mounted. The mount's hit points increase to 10 plus 2 per caster level, and its speed increases to 30 feet per 2 caster levels (maximum 150 feet).

Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the phantom steed is incorporeal, but its rider can interact with it normally.

Effect

Range 0 ft.
Effect one quasi-real creature suitable for a mount
Duration 1 hour/level (D)
Saving Throw none, see text; Spell Resistance no

Description

You conjure a Large, quasi-real creature made of flame. It functions like phantom steed, except as follows.

The flame steed is immune to fire and has acid, cold, and electricity resistance 10. If it or its rider is attacked, it automatically exhales a 15-foot cone of smoke and ash on your turn as a free action. Anyone in the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC equal to the spell DC) or become sickened for 1d6 rounds after leaving the area. This smoke acts as <a href="spelldisplay846a.html?ItemName=obscuring%20mist">obscuring mist</a> for the purpose of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round.
