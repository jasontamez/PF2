Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

Effect

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one creature
Duration 24 hours
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)

Description

The subject is protected from all devices and spells that gather information about the target through divination magic (such as detect evil, locate creature, scry, and see invisible). This spell also grants a +8 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. Mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle, and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the target. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as arcane eye, the spell works but the creature simply isn't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work at all.
