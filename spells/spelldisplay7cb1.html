Description

You banish psychic impressions from the object touched, rendering it devoid of recent history. You choose how much time to erase, up to a maximum of 1 day per caster level. You must erase impressions from the present time back; you cannot choose to leave recent events untouched. Impressions erased in this manner cannot be recovered via object reading, legend lore, or similar measures.

Casting erase impressions on a corpse removes recent psychic impressions from when the creature was alive as well, making those memories unavailable to speak with dead. For example, a 5th-level caster casting the spell on a 2-day-old corpse could erase the past 2 days of psychic impressions from the corpse and 3 additional days of information from just before the creature died.
