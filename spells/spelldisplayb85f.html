Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

Effect

Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect fog spreads in 20-ft. radius
Duration 10 min./level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no

Description

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The spell does not function underwater.

Mythic Fog Cloud

The radius of the fog increases to 50 feet.

Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the fog's radius changes to 500 feet, and its height changes to 100 feet. Winds can't dissipate the fog unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of the augmented mythic fog cloud. If you're at least 6th tier and instead expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the fog's radius changes to 1 mile, and its height changes to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind as the 3rd-tier augmented version.

Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M (small drop of poison)

Effect

Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
Effect cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
Duration 1 round/level
Saving Throw Fortitude negates; see text; Spell Resistance no

Description

Poisonous cloud creates a bank of fog like that created by fog cloud, except that the vapors are toxic. The cloud deals 1d2 points of Constitution damage per round to living creatures that fail their Fortitude saves. A creature that succeeds at its save but remains in the cloud must continue to attempt a new saving throw each round on your turn.

Poisonous cloud can be made permanent with a permanency spell cast by a caster of 13th level or higher, at a cost of 12,500 gp. A permanent poisonous cloud dispersed by wind re-forms in 10 minutes.
