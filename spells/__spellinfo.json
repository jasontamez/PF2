The shards deal an amount of slashing and piercing damage equal to 1d4 points + 1 point per shard beyond the first, and have a threat range of 19-20. They are considered magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Additionally, if your shield is made from a special material (such as adamantine), the shards penetrate damage reduction and hardness as if they were weapons made from the same material.",

Whether or not the touch attack hits, the force hook drags you in a straight line to a square adjacent to the target. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The pulling hook keeps you from falling as part of this movement; therefore you can use it to cross a pit or chasm, or reach a higher or lower elevation. If the line of effect from you to the target passes through an area that is too small to fit your body (such as a portcullis or arrow slit), the hook pulls you to that location and you take damage as if you had fallen the distance from your starting point to that location. If you are restrained, such as being chained to a wall, the hook pulls you to the maximum extent of your restraints but does not break the restraints.",

After 2 consecutive rounds of concentration, you learn the approximate distance to the detected life forms from your current location. After 3 rounds of concentration, the rain and winds allow you to determine the approximate direction of each life form. Once you've concentrated in this way for 3 rounds, you gain a bonus equal to half your caster level on your next initiative check during the spell's duration."

Its carrying capacity changes to reflect its new size. The creature's equipment and weapons, if any, also increase in size. Any enlarged item that leaves the creature's possession returns to its original size (though thrown weapons and ammunition deal damage at their enlarged size before returning to their true proportions).",

A successful Fortitude save each round negates the Dexterity damage but not the cold damage. Any creature that doesn't move on its turn becomes encased in a sheath of ice equivalent to wall of ice, is helpless, and cannot breathe. Corpses in the area for longer than 1 round are transmuted into solid ice; reviving the icy corpse requires true resurrection, miracle, or wish.

			"Draconic reservoir functions as protection from energy, absorbing 6 points of one type of energy damage per caster level (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, maximum 60 points). Each round, as a swift action, the subject can release 1d6 points of the absorbed energy and apply it to any melee attack, as if using an acidic, flaming, frost, or shock weapon. The first creature the subject strikes with this attack takes the energy damage in addition to any other consequences of the attack. Releasing energy in this way does not \"free up\" space to absorb still more energy; the maximum amount of energy the spell can absorb remains fixed. The subject cannot release more energy than he currently has absorbed. Once the subject has absorbed all the energy allowed by the spell, he takes damage as normal from that energy type. Once the energy has been released, the spell is discharged.",

The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. Augmented boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.",

			"This spell etches the symbol of a nation, organization, or order on the target, dealing 1 point of damage. The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. While branded in this way, the recipient loses the ability to speak or understand its racial language and the language of its homeland or primary culture (if these are different). For example, an elf raised among the Shoanti would lose Elven and Shoanti (if she knew both those languages), while a halfling raised among dwarves would lose both Halfling and Dwarven (if she knew both those languages). A gnome raised among gnomes would lose Gnome, but no other language. This spell never suppresses Common or Undercommon, nor does it prevent spellcasting, though it may prevent a target from speaking intelligibly if it suppresses all of the target's languages. A brand of conformity can be hidden beneath clothing or removed by scraping it away (the latter deals 1d6 points of damage, though the brand returns if that damage is healed). In any event, the language-suppression element of a brand of conformity continues to function even when hidden or scraped away."

While subject to this spell, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for casting spells, even from creatures with the Disruptive feat. Creatures with the Spellbreaker feat can easily bypass this defensive property, though they still take damage from the spell. Your casting (even failing to cast defensively) still provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures with that feat.",

No matter the modifications made to the focus weapons, they must always be mithral daggers. No other type of weapons can serve as a focus for this spell."

Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the haunt is angry and vindictive.",

A haunt's Bluff modifier equals its CR (minimum +0) or might be determined by the GM based upon the original victim. The haunt can speak only about what it knew in life and the circumstances by which it became a haunt. It cannot answer any questions that pertain to events that occurred after it was created. A neutral or good haunt might cooperate with similarly aligned creatures in order to end its suffering.",

			"You blast your enemies with blinding rays of sunlight. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit. If a ray hits, it explodes into powerful motes of light, and the target must save or be blinded for 1 round. If the target has light blindness, light sensitivity, or is otherwise vulnerable to bright light, it instead must save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4). Any creature blinded by a ray sheds light as a sunrod for the duration of its blindness. The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all rays must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.",

			"Description",
			"You create an immersive mindscape (see page 235) that the minds of both you and another creature enter together. You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it's harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can't make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.",
			"You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don't need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can't see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it's relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don't realize they're in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.",
			"More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the mindscape door spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape, but you're able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.",
			"As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.",
			"If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it's within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn't free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.",
			"This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.",
			"Create mindscape can be made permanent with a permanency spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp. You and other creatures aware of a permanent mindscape can come and go using the mindscape door spell.",

Each round in the haunt's clutches reduces the duration the victim can hold her breath by 2 rounds (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445). A victim can make a single move or standard action each round while in the haunt's grasp if she succeeds at a Will save; on a failed save, she can only struggle helplessly against the haunt. A victim cannot use her actions to swim toward the surface while the haunt is active. If the haunt reaches the bottom of its body of water, it pounds its victim against the bottom, dealing 2d6 points of nonlethal damage per round to the victim and reducing the duration the victim can hold her breath by an additional round. This continues until either the haunt is neutralized (in which case the victim must still swim to the surface) or the victim drowns.",

Furthermore, the spell's haunt-like manifestation is active throughout the spell's duration, rendering it vulnerable to effects that damage haunts.

Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.",

However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned-the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.",

			"By speaking the name \"Xhamen-Dor,\" you infuse yourself with the essence of the Inmost Blot and gain a +3 profane bonus on Will saving throws for the spell's duration. When you prepare what grows within for the first time, or the first time you use it via a spell-completion or spell-trigger item, you can thereafter be targeted by Xhamen-Dor's infected dreams ability (see page 86). As long as you are under the effects of what grows within, your mind-affecting spells carry this supernatural taint within them and can infect those who succumb to those effects. Whenever you successfully affect a creature with one of your mind-affecting spells (this requires the target to fail its saving throw against the spell if the spell allows a save, but automatically affects a target if the spell does not allow a saving throw), that target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against what grows within or it immediately becomes afflicted by a lesser version of Xhamen-Dor's seeded infestation. This infestation does not expose the victim to Xhamen-Dor's infectious dreams, but it can ultimately result in that creature's transformation into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature with what grows within in this manner, the remaining duration of what grows within is reduced by 1 round. If you affect multiple creatures in a round, you choose the order in which they must save against the effects of what grows within, and reduce the spell's remaining duration by 1 round each time one of them is affected by the infestation.",
			"Lesser Seeded Infestation'save Fortitude DC = spell's save DC; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Constitution drain; cure none. This infestation can be cured by magic alone. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 by this infestation dies and rises from death in 1d4 rounds as a seeded creature (see page 90). This is an infestation effect."

A teleporting creature that is affected by a teleport trap can resist the effect with a Will save-if the save is successful, the creature simply doesn't teleport at all (but the use of the teleport effect is still consumed)-either to the intended location or the teleport trap's actual destination. A DC 27 Knowledge (arcana) allows such a creature to recognize the teleport trap's presence, but does not reveal the trap's linked destination.",

You select this option and the conditions at the time you cast the spell. Overly complicated conditions may cause the spell to fail entirely. Multiple castings of teleport trap can be linked to cover a larger area, allowing teleported creatures to be directed to a single point within the combined area of the spells.",

At least one crypt of the Whispering Tyrant makes use of the spell as well, trapping grave robbers in coffin-sized stone cysts, there to die a slow and agonizing death from thirst and starvation."

It deals 1d6 points of damage with a slam attack, and it can wield any light or one-handed weapon. The ectoplasmic hand threatens and can flank targets.",

It can pull levers, open unstuck doors, or knock over objects. If the ectoplasmic hand must attempt a Strength check, it uses your spellcasting ability score as its Strength score. Using the ectoplasmic hand in this way requires you to concentrate and spend any actions you would normally need to use to manipulate the object yourself.",

			"Investigations into the ancient and mysterious traditions of the seven virtues of rule of the lost human empire of Azlant, which were later corrupted by the runelords into the more familiar seven deadly sins, inspired the Cyphermages to develop the runes of rule. This spell allows you to place a rune upon another creature that can then be used to aid it at a later time. You determine the spell's effect at the time of casting by using your finger to paint a specific rune on the recipient's body with a dose of specially prepared paint worth 25 gp. The inscribed rune lasts for 24 hours or until the spell is activated. Unless otherwise noted, the creature upon which the rune of rule has been inscribed can activate it at any time as a swift action. If the spell effect isn't used, all markings associated with the rune disappear and the effect fades. You can never place the spell upon yourself-it must be bestowed on someone else. The seven runes of rule, along with their specific effects when the user activates them, are listed below. A creature can bear only one rune of rule at a time.",
			"Charity: A creature bearing this mark gains a +5 insight bonus on a single attack roll or skill check attempted at the request of another creature, provided the creature bearing this mark does not gain any immediate benefit or reward for making the roll or attempting the check.",
			"Generosity: A creature bearing the rune of generosity can activate it as an immediate action, but it must do so as another creature within 30 feet activates a consumable magic item such as a potion or scroll that was given to it at some point within the last 24 hours by the creature bearing the rune. When the rune is activated, the effects of the consumable magic item resolve at a caster level that is 2 higher than the item's actual caster level.",
			"Humility: When a creature activates the rune of humility, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity for 1 round.",
			"Kindness: A creature must be using the aid another action or casting a healing spell in order to activate a rune of kindness. If the creature activates the rune while using the aid another action, the bonus imparted on a success increases to +5. If the creature instead activates the rune while casting a healing spell, the effective caster level of the spell increases by 2.",
			"Love: When a creature activates the rune of love as he casts a spell with the charm descriptor, the save DC of that spell increases by 1. Alternatively, a creature can activate the rune of love after he rolls damage for a weapon or spell attack, causing the damage dealt to become nonlethal damage.",
			"Temperance: A creature bearing the rune of temperance can activate it as an immediate action immediately upon failing a saving throw against a poison, disease, drug, or similar effect. The creature can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the effect and can use the result of that second saving throw as the actual result.",
			"Zeal: A creature that activates the rune of zeal gains a +3 bonus on Will saves, and the save DCs of all language-dependent effects created by the creature increase by 1; these effects last for 1 round."

When the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and must be awoken normally. While sleepwalk allows an unconscious creature to move, it does not awaken the creature, nor does it stabilize or otherwise heal them. A disabled creature that moves about while under the effects of this spell does not start dying again as a result of this movement."

The first time the target sees the Red Mantis reflection, it must succeed at a Will save be or shaken and take a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects for as long as it can see the altered image and for 3 rounds thereafter. A new save must be attempted each time the creature views its reflection during the spell's duration. Once a creature successfully saves, it becomes immune to being shaken by the caster's mirror mantis spell for 24 hours, though it will still see the Red Mantis reflection until the spell ends."

This chance is 5% for every full round that shadow invasion was active. If the caster level of shadow invasion is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutor kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of shadow invasion would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors."

			"This spell covers the floor, the ground, or some other calm horizontal surface (such as a placid lake or a gentle river) with a sheet of slowly growing ice. The initial sheet of ice cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. The ice is hard, strong, and opaque, and is 1 inch thick per caster level. The ice is strong enough to support the weight of a typical horse, making it possible for creatures to cross a body of water.",
			"Each 10-foot square of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the ice automatically. A section of ice whose hit points drop to 0 is destroyed, leaving an area of ice chunks, slush, and snow that counts as difficult terrain. If a creature tries to break through the ice with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + your caster level.",
			"Each round on your turn, the sheet of ice grows 1 foot in all directions except toward you. This growth is slow enough that any creature in the area has time to move out of the way or step onto the ice. If the growing ice completely covers a creature's square, the creature must choose whether it moves onto the sheet of ice, is knocked prone on the sheet of ice, or is bull rushed into an adjacent square."

If the host succeeds at a saving throw against a spell that you cast in this way, it immediately becomes aware that it is possessed, and if it was already aware, it receives another saving throw against riding possession.

Each rune illuminates a 5-foot cube, preventing any spell you cast of up to 3rd level and that has a defined area (as opposed to targets or an effect) from entering or affecting the 5-foot cube. For example, creatures and items within any square affected by peace bond take no damage from a fireball you cast. However, if you cast stinking cloud, the noxious vapors are an effect and enter such cubes normally. This spell does not break line of effect within any other spells you cast; it simply negates all effects of your 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-level area spells within the peace bond's area. Peace bond offers no protection against your spell-like abilities or supernatural area effects."

You can't choose triggering conditions that rely on unobservable information, such as having it triggered when creatures of a certain alignment enter the area, nor could you have the alarm be triggered by \"something worth more than 5,000 gp\" entering the area, or even \"a weapon\" entering the area, because an item's value and classification as a weapon is subjective, and might vary from one person to the next."

Unlike with summon monster or similar spells, the caster has no control whatsoever over the called creature. The spawn immediately heads in a random direction or toward an obvious target such as a population center, destroying anything in its path, yourself and your allies included.",

However, if such an attempt fails, it draws the spawn's attention, and the monster immediately tries to destroy the creature that attempted to control it.

In order to do so, you must expend one use of mythic power plus three additional uses of mythic power per point of Challenge Rating the specified spawn represents above CR 20.

			"When you cast earthquake, an intense but highly localized tremor rips the ground. The powerful shockwave created by this spell knocks creatures down, collapses structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures in the area. The specific effect of an earthquake spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.",
			"Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel: The roof collapses, dealing 8d6 points of damage to any creature caught under the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half) and pinning that creature beneath the rubble (see below). An earthquake cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris and rubble.",
			"Cliffs: Earthquake causes a cliff to crumble, creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).",
			"Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 40 feet deep. At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut. Treat all trapped creatures as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche, trapped without air (see Environment for more details).",
			"Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 100 points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry. Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).",
			"River, Lake, or Marsh: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell, sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.",
			"Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned beneath rubble takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.",
			"Mythic Earthquake",
			"Source ~`Mythic Adventures pg. 92`~",
			"Increase the damage dealt to structures by 10 points of damage per tier. Increase the damage dealt by cave-ins and landslides to 10d8 points of damage. Increase the damage dealt to those pinned beneath rubble to 1d10 points per minute. Add your tier to the DC of concentration checks and Constitution checks attempted as a consequence of this spell.",
			"Augmented (8th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell lasts for an additional round and the spread's radius increases by 20 feet. Each round this spell is in effect, on your turn you may expend one use of mythic power to continue its duration for 1 round and increase its radius by another 20 feet."

Your scouts must spend 1d6 hours investigating the target location, but need no oversight. When done, they return unerringly to you with their findings, traveling up to 1 mile per caster level you have to rejoin their master. Each insect's size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can't attack. Because of their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can attempt Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level.",
			"Each scout that returns passes along memories of specific structural flaws, defenses, and alarms, granting you the ability to reroll one failed skill check per scout, as long as the skill check involves that specific location's layout, such as a Stealth check to sneak in, a Disable Device check to silence an alarm, or a Perception check to notice a trap. If even one scout returns, you also gain a rough understanding of the building's layout (at least, any portions your scouts could access). All insight (and the associated rerolls) fades 1 hour per caster level you have after the scouts return. Your insects remember nothing about creatures, and so provide no information about guardians or any conversations they may overhear."

			"A weapon made of force appears and attacks foes at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, + 1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.",
			"Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.",
			"A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weapon's AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).",
			"If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.",
			"The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).",
			"Mythic Spiritual Weapon",
			"Source ~`Mythic Adventures pg. 109`~",
			"The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic weapon special abilities: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering. Before or after the weapon attempts all of its attacks for the round, you can redirect it to a different target as a swift action instead of a move action"

			"You direct spirits into the shadows of creatures. The shadows of creatures that fail their Will saving throws appear slightly different for the duration of the spell, bearing small horns, unusually long and slender arms, or other small discrepancies. This spell does not work on creatures that do not cast shadows or reflections. At will as an immediate action (but no more often than once every 10 minutes), a mischievous shadow can interfere with its host's actions or the actions of adjacent creatures by interacting with their shadows in ways that affect their physical counterparts, such as grabbing the shadow of a crossbow to redirect the physical weapon's aim. Each disruption either imposes a -8 penalty on a single attack roll, combat maneuver check, or Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, or requires a spellcaster to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) or lose a spell being cast. If you are within range of the spell effect, you can decide how these shadows interfere; otherwise, their actions are timed and decided by the GM as needed, typically manifesting during important or crucial roles. Each time a mischievous shadow makes such a disruption, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.",

			"Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration. A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.",
			"The table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering's equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of planar ally. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of miracle or wish. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature's choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.",
			"You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain 2 permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus, nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 Hit Dice worth of creatures to pay for a 10-HD creature's service.",

			"You can discharge this spell in order to make an especially powerful attack with the spear. The spear's critical range becomes 18-20 and its critical multiplier becomes ??3. If you make this attack as part of a charge action, you gain an enhancement bonus of +30 feet to your base speed while performing the charge. If you throw the spear as part of this attack, its range increment increases to 80 feet. If you cast this spell on a masterwork spear, it also gains the bane special ability against the selected creature type and automatically bypasses any damage reduction (except DR/-) regardless of the creature's type. After resolving the attack, the spear is completely destroyed in a burst of energy.",
			"Any creature other than you treats the spear as a normal weapon of its type. You can have only one huntmaster's spear in effect at a time. If you cast the spell again, any previous instance of the spell immediately ends. If you expend a monster trophy of the type selected as an optional material component for this spell, you reduce the casting time to 1 round."

Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your Combat Maneuver Bonus, and you add your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. No save is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it ends if you cease concentration.",
			"Violent Thrust: Alternatively, the spell energy can be spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects. You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).",
			"You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in this manner).

Any magic item or magical spell or effect of your caster level or lower that passes through the wall is suppressed for 1 round per level. Spells or effects with durations expire normally, even while thus suppressed. A spell or effect with a duration greater than that of the suppression effect resumes functioning normally when the suppression ends. The wall affects all magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, magical items, and any effects stemming from them that pass through the wall. The wall does not suppress a creature's ability to cast spells, use spell-like abilities, or any other sort of limited-use abilities even if the wall suppresses a particular application of those abilities. However, if a creature with magical abilities that are constant or otherwise always active passes through the wall, those abilities are suppressed for the normal duration.",

Magic items or spell effects with a higher caster level than yours are unaffected by the wall of suppression.

You can place the object in the open or inside a container, a pocket, or even someone's hand. If there isn't room in the space you select (either because the space chosen is too small or because there is already something else there), or if the person doesn't want or isn't expecting the object in his hands, it appears on the ground within the target's square instead. You can transport the object to an elevation above the floor as long as the destination is within the spell's total distance limit.",

You don't need line of sight to the object to apport it to you, but the object must be within a distance equal to 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels. Completing the spell is a swift action that has the same restrictions as a thought spell component. You can apport an object in this way even if someone holding the object is unwilling to let you take it. Once you apport the object, the spell ends.",

Objects secured to a nonmetallic fixture remain where they are unless a forceful tug would be enough to detach them. Loose objects weighing more than 500 pounds are not affected. If the magnetic field would cause a dangerous metal object such as a sword or anvil to intersect a square occupied by a creature, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save or take damage as if from an improvised weapon of the object's size (or smaller or larger, at the GM's discretion).",

A creature can drop a metal object it's holding as a free action to avoid the effect if it's not wearing metal armor; a creature being dragged by its shield can loosen it as a move action and drop it as a free action. Creatures made entirely or mostly of metal take a -2 penalty on their Reflex saves. Creatures that fail their saves by 5 or more are pulled an additional 5 feet closer for every increment of 5 by which they failed their saves."

You take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain when you begin the speech and can't reduce or prevent this damage in any way. Each intelligent creature in the spell's area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell's duration.

Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a -4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can't force beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.",
			"If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), your sanity score decreases by 2 (and thus your sanity edge decreases by 1) instead of taking Wisdom drain each time you cast this spell. Only greater restoration, miracle, or wish can remove this decrease. A single casting of greater restoration removes one decrease of sanity from casting borrow corruption, while a casting of miracle or wish removes them all. Affected targets take sanity damage equal to half your caster level (maximum 10) instead of Wisdom damage. The targets might actually change alignment and beliefs if their loss of sanity afflicts them with an appropriate madness, in which case those effects last even after the spell's duration has ended."

Any creature that enters the affected area must succeed at a Will save or gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your caster level against any abjuration effect that provides resistance to or protection against cold damage or cold climates. This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered.

Against creatures with multiple layers of protection, these dispel checks start with the highest-level abjuration effects and work their way down the list.

If you don't have the trapfinding class ability, this spell grants you the trapfinding ability of a rogue of half your character level. If you have the trapfinding ability granted by class levels, however, this spell grants you a +5 competence bonus on all Disable Device checks made to disarm mechanical (but not magical) traps. While under the effects of Aram Zey's focus, whenever you trigger a trap by rolling poorly on a Disable Device check, you may roll a second Disable Device check. This new roll uses the same modifiers as the first roll. If your second roll is high enough to avoid accidentally springing the trap, you avoid setting it off, but still fail to disarm it. Each time you take advantage of this feature, the remaining duration of the spell is reduced by 1 minute-if less than a minute's worth of duration remains, the spell ends as soon as you reroll your Disable Device check."

If your body or skin is slain with your consciousness in it, the spell ends and you are instantly killed.",

This servant cannot fly, climb, or even swim (though it can walk on water). Its base speed is 15 feet.",

			"You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane. For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.",
			"You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.",
			"Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.",
			"This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.",
			"If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level."

The target has a 20% chance of failing to cast spells with verbal components until the bleeding is stopped. The effects of multiple castings of this spell do not stack. Optionally, the thread can be removed more carefully over the course of a minute with a DC 20 Heal check. If the check fails, the target takes damage and bleeds as described above. If the check succeeds, the stitches are removed with no harm. Creatures with no mouths are unaffected by lipstitch. Creatures with multiple mouths lose the use of only one mouth per casting-the particular mouth is chosen by the caster."

Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card's alignment matches the target creature's alignment. If the card and target's alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit's check.

If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit's check.",

You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed.",

			"An ally made of pure force appears in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god. The spiritual ally occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. The spiritual ally carries a single weapon, one favored by your deity (as for spiritual weapon), which has the same threat range and critical modifiers as a real weapon of its form. Each round on your turn, starting with the turn that you cast this spell, your spiritual ally can make an attack against a foe within its reach that you designate. The spiritual ally threatens adjacent squares and can flank and make attacks of opportunity as if it were a normal creature. The spiritual ally uses your base attack bonus (gaining extra attacks if your base attack bonus is high enough) plus your Wisdom bonus when it makes a melee attack. When the spiritual ally hits, it deals 1d10 points of force damage + 1 point of damage per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). It strikes as a spell, not a weapon, so it bypasses DR and can affect incorporeal creatures.",
			"Each round after the first, you can move the spiritual ally as a swift action. It has a speed of 30 feet, and a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect maneuverability). Being a construct of force, the spiritual ally cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual ally's AC against touch attacks is 10.",
			"If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual ally strikes it. If the ally is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell."

To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.",
			"While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all times to your physical body by an incorporeal silver cord. If the cord is broken, you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different plane, the silver cord remains invisibly attached to the new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane, thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. This is a traumatic affair, however, and you gain two permanent negative levels if your second body or astral form is slain. Although astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical body must be materialized on other planes.",
			"You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as dispel magic cast upon either the physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills you).",

Immovable once formed, the wall of ectoplasm is 1 inch thick per caster level and covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ectoplasm 100 feet long and 10 feet h igh, a wall 25 feet long and 40 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion and need not be anchored, but must be created continuous and unbroken. The wall can't include squares that have creatures within them, even if the creatures are on the Ethereal Plane. The wall exists on both the Material Plane and Ethereal Plane, and blocks ethereal and incorporeal creatures from passing through it.",
			"One side of the wall, selected by you, radiates a deeply foreboding and menacing aura from the writhing spirits within. The range of this mind-affecting fear effect is 10 feet from the wall's surface, and creatures that are in range when the wall is created or that later approach to within 10 feet must succeed at a Will save or become shaken (or panicked if they have 4 Hit Dice or fewer) for 1 round per your caster level.",
			"Each 10-foot square of the wall has 2 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of the wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached, but if a section is destroyed, the remaining ectoplasm in the wall immediately fills in any such hole created, reducing the wall's overall size by one 10-foot square but remaining a contiguous barrier. The wall can also take the form of a sphere or hemisphere whose maximum radius is 1 foot per caster level, and that is as hard to break through as the ectoplasmic plane form."

The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed. This requirement reduces the spell's area by half. The wall can be crudely shaped to allow crenellations, battlements, and so forth by likewise reducing the area.",
			"Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 8 and 15 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 20 + 2 per inch of thickness.",
			"It is possible, but difficult, to trap mobile opponents within or under a wall of stone, provided the wall is shaped so it can hold the creatures. Creatures can avoid entrapment with successful Reflex saves.",

The wall is immune to non-mythic disintegrate, shatter, sympathetic vibration, and other non-mythic magical effects that specifically affect stone (including earthquake, soften earth and stone, and transmute rock to mud)."

Any evil creature striking you with unarmed strikes, natural weapons, or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time, the attacker takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Spell resistance applies against this damage. You also take half damage from magical attacks with the evil descriptor. If such an attack allows a Reflex save for half damage, you take no damage on a successful saving throw."

Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10-foot radius around the center of the spell's effect.

For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible.",
			"Regardless of the version of binding you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.",
			"If you cast any of the first three versions of binding (those with limited durations), you may cast additional binding spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all binding spells it has received are broken.",

			"Chaining: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an antipathy spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of binding is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.",
			"Slumber: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of binding is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.",
			"Bound Slumber: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a sleep effect.",
			"Hedged Prison: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.",
			"Metamorphosis: The subject assumes gaseous form, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.",
			"Minimus Containment: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The binding is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.",
			"You can't dispel a binding spell with dispel magic or a similar effect, though an antimagic field or mage's disjunction affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by dismissal, banishment, or a similar effect."

For the duration of the spell, the devil does everything in its power to kill the challenger. You do not control the devil or have any influence over how it conducts itself in battle, but the devil cannot leave the testing ground. Unlike with summon monster and similar spells, you cannot dismiss the devil. Rather, the conjured devil remains until any one of the following criteria is met: it is reduced below 0 hit points or otherwise defeated, its challenger is slain, its challenger leaves the testing ground, or it takes damage from any source other than its challenger. Upon any of these occurrences, the devil vanishes.",

			"A white, 15-foot-long lash of ghostly evanescence appears from your hand. This weapon is treated as a ghost touch whip with no enhancement bonus. You can wield it as a whip as if you were proficient. Attacks with a ghost whip are resolved as incorporeal touch attacks. The whip affects only creatures you attack with it, passing through objects and other creatures in its path and thereby allowing you to ignore cover between you and your target. When a ghost whip attack passes through total cover, the target is treated as having total concealment (50% miss chance). Against incorporeal and undead creatures, a ghost whip deals lethal damage and can be used to perform drag or reposition combat maneuvers (in addition to a whip's normal disarm and trip maneuvers). A ghost whip cannot be disarmed or sundered."

			"You gain a dim impression of the activities around any object bearing your face or form and can also project your consciousness into one such object at a time, allowing you to observe or even interact with nearby creatures. This spell allows you to leave your body and subconsciously monitor the immediate area around any depiction of your image whether one, hundreds, or even thousands. Each such image has the full range of your normal senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.) and you can make a Perception check to notice anything occurring nearby. The DC of this check is always 10 greater than what it would be if you were actually present at that location, so even if you would normally notice something automatically (such as talking, normally a DC of 0), you would need to make a DC 10 Perception check to notice it.",
			"You may, at any time, choose to fill one specific image within range with your consciousness. While inside an image you lose the ability to monitor any other images within range but remain fully aware of your own body's surroundings. Your body is defenseless and helpless (always failing any saving throw) while your consciousness is filling an image, but you can return to it at any time as an immediate action.",
			"When you fill an image with your consciousness it gains a limited form of animation. Statues and similar three-dimensional representations can move their heads, make gestures, and talk, but cannot attack or leave their square without assistance. Portraits or similar two-dimensional representations bearing your likeness can also talk and your image can move anywhere within the picture or even temporarily alter it (such as by picking a flower in the painting). You cannot use any spells or other abilities while within an image.",
			"You may leave the image at any time, returning you to your body. Once your consciousness departs from an object bearing your likeness, it immediately reverts to the appearance it had before you entered it. If someone destroys or damages the image you return to your body unharmed. The spell lasts until you cease concentrating, or until it is terminated by some outside means, such as a dispel magic cast upon either the image or your body, or if your body is killed."

			"Kreighton Shaine researched this spell from the fragmentary notes of a Vudrani ascetic recorded in a strange tome, and rumors credit him with no fewer than a dozen permanent stolen light gems hidden in compartments and drawers in his study. Stolen light stores images within a gem. To store an image, as part of casting you must touch a gem worth not less than 500 gp. You trap within the gem an image of everything visible within a 30-foot cone measured from the gem, in a direction of your choice. Alternatively, you can capture a less detailed image of a single object within sight. Once the casting is complete, the gem turns opaque, and the image inside cannot be seen. The stolen image remains within the gem until released or dispelled.",
			"To release an image, you touch a gem holding stolen light as a standard action and speak a command word chosen at the time of casting. For 1 minute per caster level, the image stored within the gem becomes visible. Details can be made out as clearly as they could be perceived at the time of casting. Darkvision is of no use for making out details in a stolen image, though low-light vision or other exceptional visual talents may reveal information the caster did not see. Light sources brighter than bright light are reduced to bright light in the stolen image. Once the image has been released, it cannot again be recovered from the gem.",
			"Stolen light can be made permanent with the permanency spell by a caster of 10th level for a cost of 5,000 gp. This leaves the gem capable of projecting the image indefinitely, activated and deactivated by its command word, until it is destroyed or dispelled."

Attacks with a rock whip strike with resounding force; you can make a free bull rush combat maneuver against any creature you strike with a rock whip, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your primary casting ability score modifier (Charisma for sorcerers, Intelligence for wizards, and so on) in place of your Strength modifier."

Whenever the pack damages an opponent with its swarm attack, it can immediately attempt a trip combat maneuver check against that creature with its trip special attack. The pack does not gain any damage reduction or immunity to damage and can be attacked by effects that target a specific number of creatures, though such attacks deal 1/4 the normal amount of damage (25%) and effects that don't deal hit point damage are only 25% likely to work."

To all normal tests you are, in fact, a tree or shrub, although a detect magic spell reveals a faint transmutation on the tree. While in tree form, you can observe all that transpires around you just as if you were in your normal form, and your hit points and save bonuses remain unaffected. You gain a +10 natural armor bonus to AC but have an effective Dexterity score of 0 and a speed of 0 feet. You are immune to critical hits while in tree form. All clothing and gear carried or worn changes with you. You can dismiss tree shape as a free action (instead of as a standard action)."

You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures. In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy.

Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the magic jar, and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.",
			"If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities.

The knife deals 1d4 points of force damage on a successful hit and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a normal dagger.

This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the moment of prescience before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one moment of prescience active on you at the same time."

If the target was prone at the time of casting, you can choose for the target to be standing upon reaching the destination. Furthermore, if the target was bound with nonmagical ropes, manacles, or other restraints, those restraints are not transported with the target, effectively freeing the target from those restraints. If the target is bound by magical restraints, you can bar those restraints from being transported with the target with a successful caster level check against a DC based on the restraints' caster level (DC = 11 + the restraining magic item's or spell's caster level)."

If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.",
			"You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.",
			"A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.",
			"This spell is not cumulative with protection from evil and vice versa."

When a creature touches the target object, it can attempt a Will save to negate the spell's effect. Although a successful save prevents the creature from becoming haunted, the haunt still resides within the object, and targets either the next creature to touch the object or the same creature again if it still holds the object after 24 hours. The haunt remains within the object until a creature fails its save or the spell's duration ends.",
			"Once a creature is affected by the haunt, it begins noticing a large, black mastiff with ominous green eyes watching and following it from a distance, always just beyond the range of focus or interaction. The grim stalker terrorizes the creature's sleep, affecting it as per nightmare every night during the spell's duration (Will negates for one night). Each time the creature takes hit point damage, the grim stalker lunges closer, causing the creature to become shaken for 1 round (Will negates). Each time the creature is reduced to less than one-tenth of its maximum hit points, the grim stalker lunges at the creature as an immediate action, affecting it as per phantasmal killer.",
			"Each time the grim stalker lunges at the affected creature, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round. Alternatively, a haunted creature can attempt to force the grim stalker to manifest using a simple ritual that requires a successful Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), or Spellcraft check; occult reagents costing 450 gp (which are consumed as part of the ritual); and a full-round action. The DC for this check equals the spell's save DC. Successfully performing the ritual causes the grim stalker to manifest as a Nessian warhound (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 173) in an available square 20 feet away from the victim, save that its only subtype is extraplanar, its alignment is neutral, its bite and breath weapon deal negative energy damage instead of fire damage, and it has negative energy affinity instead of fire immunity and vulnerability to cold. The grim stalker immediately attacks the affected creature, persisting until either it or the creature is slain, at which point the spell effect (and the warhound) disappears.",

A normal plant's sense of its surroundings is limited, so it won't be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions of creatures or answer questions about events outside its immediate vicinity. The spell doesn't make plant creatures any more friendly or cooperative than normal. Furthermore, wary and cunning plant creatures are likely to be terse and evasive, while the more stupid ones may make inane comments. If a plant creature is friendly, it may do some favor or service for you."

			"This spell turns natural, uncut, or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a -2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush or similar material thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.",
			"If transmute rock to mud is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the targeted area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.",
			"Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since transmute rock to mud can't affect worked stone and doesn't reach deep enough to undermine such buildings' foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.",
			"The mud remains until a successful dispel magic or transmute mud to rock spell restores its substance-but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.",

It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike.

If the target is in the area of a plant growth spell as it is cast, it must attempt a Fortitude save at green caress's DC or immediately take another 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score; this stacks with multiple castings of plant growth. If the target is in the area of diminish plants as it is cast, it ignores the next ability damage from green caress to one of its three physical ability scores (chosen randomly); this doesn't stack with multiple castings of diminish plants."

This spell can fool any sound-based blindsense or blindsight (including echolocation), but it can't fool other forms of detection such as other forms of blindsense or blindsight, lifesense, normal vision, and tremorsense. The target receives a saving throw against the effect if it doesn't wish for you to shift its sound, and any creature that interacts with the illusion receives a Will save to disbelieve the glamer."

			"This spell functions as dream travel, but you and your companions travel through the Dimension of Dreams in a fantastical vehicle of your own devising that halves the travel time. Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren't inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects. Unlike with dream travel, there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry from dream travel.",
			"Creatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the dreamscape or exit to the plane where the dreamer's body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the dreamer's body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The dreamer can't prevent the dream voyagers from entering its dream, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.",
			"The psychic vehicle remains in the dream for the remainder of the spell's duration, even if it's unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the dreamer can reenter the dream vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast dream voyage to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the dream again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell's duration. If the vessel moves out of a dreamscape, companions left behind can't return to the vessel by being near the dreamer. If a companion is killed, its body doesn't return to the dream voyage unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.",
			"If the dreamer awakens while the dream vessel is still in its dream, it can allow the dream travelers to exit or not (as with dream travel). The dream vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell's duration even if it's untethered from a dream. It drifts through dreams when this happens, and you can't pilot it to another dream (even a dream of the initial dreamer if that creature begins dreaming again). If you dismiss the spell at any time, you and all subjects within the dream vessel return to where you started on the Material Plane.",
			"You can increase the number of companions you can bring on a dream voyage to 10 creatures per caster level, though to do so you must increase the casting time, maintaining your concentration and touching up to 6 creatures per round as a fullround action. If your concentration is disrupted before you touch all of the targets, the spell is wasted and has no effect. Once you have touched all of your companions, the dream voyage begins; however, its duration is reduced to 1 hour."

			"The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment. A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a soulless bit of inert flesh which rots if not preserved."

			"Description",
			"The target of this spell gains no benefit from normal or magical sleep, writhing in a series of nightmares that torture its psyche and diminish its ability to perform strenuous tasks. The target doesn't heal ability or hit point damage naturally and can't prepare spells or regain spell slots. After one night of poor sleep, the target is fatigued (or exhausted if it was fatigued before trying to rest). A creature affected by this spell doesn't recover from the fatigued or exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such as lesser restoration provide any respite. Each restless night, the target takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, which also can't be recovered by magic while night terrors is active.",
			"The images from previous nightmares continue to haunt the target's mind while awake. If the target has rested at least once while affected by night terrors and then becomes subjected to a fear condition, the target experiences the next higher level of fear than it would normally. However, per the alternate rules for fear (see page 10), this spell cannot cause a lesser state of fear to become a greater one. If the effect causing the fear condition doesn't usually stack with other fear effects, the target's level of fear does not increase. This aspect of the spell is a fear effect.",
			"The affected creature can attempt a new saving throw once per day to end night terrors, but multiple attempts to rest in a given day do not afford the target multiple saves. A creature that successfully saves against night terrors ends the spell and rests normally that night but gains the benefits of only that night's rest, not any benefits missed on previous nights.",
			"If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), the target takes 1d8 points of sanity damage instead of Wisdom damage."
