Description

A dragon that fails its saving throw cannot use its breath weapon for
the duration of the spell and is treated as one age category younger
for determining which special abilities it can use. For example, an
ancient green dragon would revert to the special abilities of a very
old dragon and lose access to its miasma ability and its dominate
person spell-like ability. This spell has no effect on a dragon's armor
class, feats, frightful presence, hit points, physical attacks, saving
throws, senses, size, skills, spellcasting, or statistics.
