Description

Originally designed by an Aldori magus who had long admired swashbucklers for their ability to deflect blows, Deivon's parry has swiftly gained popularity among bards and magi alike. Your reflexes snap into action, allowing you to deflect a blow. This spell can be cast only when an opponent makes a melee attack against you, and only before the attack roll has been made. Make a parry attempt with a light or one-handed weapon you're wielding, as if using the swashbuckler's opportune parry and riposte deed (except that this does not require panache). You cannot riposte as part of this spell's effect.
