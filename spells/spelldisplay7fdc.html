Description

You suppress magical sound-dampening effects within the area. Disrupt silence temporarily negates magical silence within its area, so that normal sounds can be heard within the overlapping areas of effect. Additionally, disrupt silence can automatically counter or dispel any magical silence effect of equal or lower level cast upon the same target, such as silence. If you cast disrupt silence on the target of a higher-level silence effect, it functions as dispel magic instead of its normal function.
