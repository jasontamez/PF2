Description

You overload the target creature's senses, making it difficult for the target to concentrate. For the duration of the effect, the target must succeed at a Will save at the same DC as the original effect to perform any standard or full-round action. On a failure, the creature loses the action that triggered the saving throw. If successful, the creature is able to take the action, but this spell effect is not negated.
