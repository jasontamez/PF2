Description

You create a warhammer of magically hardened
ice and send it hurling toward the target.
You must succeed at a ranged touch attack
to strike the target. If hit, the target takes 1d8
points of damage per 2 caster levels you possess
(maximum 5d8); half this damage is bludgeoning
damage, half is cold damage. The frosthammer
counts as having a +1 enhancement bonus for the
purpose of bypassing DR. If the target takes any
bludgeoning damage from the hammer, you may attempt a
trip combat maneuver check against that target, except you may
use your caster level instead of your BAB and your spellcasting
ability modifier (Wisdom for clerics, and so on) instead of your
Strength modifier.
