Description

You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to dehydrate. The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of drinking can counter this effect, although the target still experiences the other normal effects of any liquid imbibed (such as poisons or potions). Cup of dust can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell, but effects suffered as a result of dehydration must be healed by normal means.

Mythic Cup of Dust

On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist dehydration as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires drinking, such as potions and elixirs (though these are still used up when the target drinks them).
