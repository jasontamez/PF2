Description

This simple jinx causes a target's hair or fur to fall out in patchy clumps, leaving the creature disheveled and less commanding. A jinxed creature takes a -2 penalty on all Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform checks until the hair begins to regrow 1 week later, or until the damage can be concealed with a successful Disguise or Heal check (the DC is equal to the original save DC of the spell). A successful break enchantment, remove curse, or similar effect instantly regrows the target's hair or fur and removes the spell's effects.
