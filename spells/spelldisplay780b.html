Description

A shimmering torrent of raw elemental power springs into existence, originating from your outstretched palms. The blast resembles a horizontal whirlwind of howling winds, searing flame, and tumbling shrapnel of ice and metal. Any creature in the area of effect must make a Reflex save or take 8d6 points of damage from a variety of effects-2d6 points of fire damage, 2d6 points of cold damage, 2d6 points of sonic damage, and 2d6 points of slashing damage that overcomes adamantine damage reduction.

The elemental line is an ongoing effect that persists for as long as you remain concentrating on it, up to 1 round for every three levels you possess (maximum 6 rounds). The line affects any creatures that pass through it on their turn, requiring them to make Reflex saves or take damage as noted.

On your turn you may shift the line's position as you please. Moving the line does not cause it to sweep through intermediary squares but only affects creatures in its new area of effect.
