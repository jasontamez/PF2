Description

With a touch, you enchant a shield and enable it to protect its wielder from hostile spells. The shield grants spell resistance 10 + your caster level against spells so long as the shield can be interposed between the wielder and the spell effect. A spell shield does not provide spell resistance against area effect spells such as fireball, but does provide a +5 bonus on Reflex saving throws against such spells.
