Description

Each time a subject of this spell attempts to attack another creature
or object, or otherwise perform an aggressive or damaging action
toward a creature or object, it must attempt a Will save. If the save
succeeds, the subject can attack normally. If the save fails, the
subject cannot follow through with the attack and loses that part
of its action. Creatures not taking violent actions are unaffected
by this spell.
