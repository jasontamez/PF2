Description

This spell functions as instant summons, except it can only summon a construct you control. For constructs such as golems that are immune to magic, the value of the specially inscribed sapphire must be at least 5,000 gp. For other constructs, a 1,000 gp sapphire suffices.

If the construct is no longer under your control or destroyed, the spell fails, but you know roughly where the construct or its remains are located.
