Description

This spell originated among the armies of Heaven. Choose a
specific subtype of evil outsider when you cast this spell, such
as daemon, demon, devil, or div. All manufactured weapons in
the area of effect bypass the DR of that type of outsider. The
weapons do not become aligned or change composition.
