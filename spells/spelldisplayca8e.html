Description

If you cast tidal surge on land, you create an onrushing surge of water 10 feet high in a 30-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have (maximum 10d6 at 20th level) and extinguishes all nonmagical fires in the area. Magical fire effects in the area of a tidal surge are affected as if you had cast dispel magic. In addition to taking damage, creatures that fail their Reflex saves are pushed 1d4??5 feet away from you, and Medium or smaller creatures are also knocked prone.

If you cast this spell in or on a body of water at least 30 feet across, you can shape the spell either as the cone described above or as a 60-foot line. In either shape, the water deals 1d10 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 caster levels you have in addition to pushing away creatures that fail their Reflex saves.
