Description

You gain access to the subject's memories and knowledge. You can attempt to learn the answer to one question per round. A successful Will save ends the spell. Otherwise, the creature can attempt a Bluff check with a DC equal to 11 + your Sense Motive modifier. If it fails its Bluff check, you gain the answer you desire. If it succeeds at its check, you gain no information. If it succeeds by 5 or more, it answers whatever it chooses, and you believe that wrong answer to be true. Your questions are purely telepathic inquiries, and the answers to those questions are imparted directly to your mind. You and the target don't need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate sensory images in answer to your questions.
