Description

Created by Ghorus as a safety measure to limit his enemies' movements, this spell allows you to inscribe a powerful rune on any surface. Woodland rune triggers when any non-plant creature (apart from the caster) moves within 30 feet of the rune. When it's triggered, roots and branches sprout from the ground, catching all creatures within a 30-foot burst of the rune and hindering their movement as if they were moving through <a href="rules2ed3.html?Name=Forest%20Terrain&amp;Category=Wilderness">heavy undergrowth</a>, though it does not provide concealment. Plant creatures and creatures under the effect of woodland stride or <a href="spelldisplayd71b.html?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement">freedom of movement</a> are not affected by this spell. In all other respects, this spell functions as <a href="spelldisplay88c1.html?ItemName=symbol%20of%20death">symbol of death</a>.
