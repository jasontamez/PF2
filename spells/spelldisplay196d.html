Description

Using a slashing motion with the spell's focus as part of the casting of shadow invasion, you cut open a rift to the Plane of Shadow that fills a 30-foot area with shadowy energies. This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as shadow evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of shadow invasion.

In addition, the rift created by shadow invasion has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through. When shadow invasion is dismissed as a standard action, there is a chance that a single evangelist kyton will be summoned under the caster's command (as per summon monster V). This chance is 5% for every full round that shadow invasion was active. If the caster level of shadow invasion is 16th or greater, this effect summons an interlocutor kyton instead. A kyton summoned this way remains for a number of rounds equal to what the remaining duration of shadow invasion would have been had it not been dismissed. Successfully summoning a kyton this way is a lawful and evil act, as though casting a spell with the lawful and evil descriptors.
