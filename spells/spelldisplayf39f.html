Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, DF

Effect

Range touch
Target weapon touched
Duration 1 min./level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless, object); Spell Resistance yes (harmless, object)

Description

Magic weapon gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon's +1 bonus on attack rolls.

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see magic fang). A monk's unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell.

Magic Weapon, Greater

School <a href="spelldefinitionsfc86.html?ID=8">transmutation</a>; Level antipaladin 3, arcanist 3, bloodrager 3, cleric 4, inquisitor 3, magus 3, occultist 3, oracle 4, paladin 3, redmantisassassin 3, shaman 4, sorcerer 3, warpriest 4, wizard 3

Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S, M/DF (powdered lime and carbon)

Effect

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one weapon or 50 projectiles (all of which must be together at the time of casting)
Duration 1 hour/level
Saving Throw Will negates (harmless, object); Spell Resistance yes (harmless, object)

Description

This spell functions like magic weapon, except that it gives a weapon an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls of +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a weapon to bypass damage reduction aside from magic.

Alternatively, you can affect as many as 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets. The projectiles must be of the same kind, and they have to be together (in the same quiver or other container). Projectiles, but not thrown weapons, lose their transmutation after they are used. Treat shuriken as projectiles, rather than as thrown weapons, for the purpose of this spell.

Mythic Magic Weapon, Greater

You can add one of the following weapon special abilities to the weapon: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering.

Augmented (5th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can reduce the granted enhancement bonus by 1 to add two of the above abilities or one of the following abilities: anarchic, axiomatic, flaming burst, holy, icy burst, shocking burst, or unholy.
