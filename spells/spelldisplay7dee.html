Description

You grab a creature with telekinesis and use it to batter nearby opponents or objects. You must target a specific creature when casting this spell and once you select that creature you cannot switch to another. Each round, as a standard action, you can attempt to hurl the target at any creature or object within 30 feet of it. You must make an attack roll whenever you use the target as a weapon. The attack bonus for this attack is equal to your caster level plus either your Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). If you successfully hit the new target with the creature both it and the creature take damage based on the creature's size.

The target creature can make a Fortitude saving throw each time you attempt to use it as a weapon. If it makes its saving throw it can act normally, but if it fails its save it loses all actions for the round and ends its turn prone in a square adjacent to the target of your attack. However, if the creature chooses to resist your efforts to move it, taking no other actions for the round, it gets a +4 circumstance bonus on its saving throw. The spell ends immediately if the target creature dies or is destroyed.

Mythic Enemy Hammer

The target becomes entangled whether or not it succeeds at its saving throw. When using the target as a weapon, add half your tier to your attack roll, and add your tier to the damage roll.

Augmented (3rd): If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use the target to hit a creature, you can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver against that creature. Your CMB for this maneuver is equal to your attack bonus for mythic enemy hammer, except you add your tier instead of half your tier.
