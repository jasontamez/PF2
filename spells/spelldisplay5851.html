Description

A creature targeted by this spell is held immobile by glowing
golden chains composed of pure light. The creature is paralyzed
and held in place, but may attempt a new saving throw each round
to end the effect. While held by the golden chains, a creature
cannot use any sort of extradimensional travel, such as astral
projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness,
gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spells
and spell-like abilities. The spell does not affect creatures that are
already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast.
