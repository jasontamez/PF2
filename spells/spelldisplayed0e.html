Description

You read the psychic impressions left upon an object by emotionally or psychically charged events in the item's history, or the information imprinted by the charge object or implant false reading spells. This spell returns the same information as the psychometry occult skill unlock (see page 196), but gives 1 piece of information when cast and requires 1 round of concentration per additional piece of information instead of 1 minute. You must still attempt an Appraise check to see how much information you gain. You gain a +10 competence bonus on the check.
