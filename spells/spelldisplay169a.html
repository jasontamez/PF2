Description

You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15). Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination as if it were a continual flame spell. You can only have one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as fire shield.

Mythic Shield of the Dawnflower

The disk of sunlight protects you as a buckler with a +1 enhancement bonus per 4 caster levels (maximum +5).

You can make a melee touch attack with your shield of the Dawnflower in place of a normal attack to deal its fire damage to a creature. Creatures taking damage from your shield catch on fire (Reflex negates); the save DC to extinguish the fire is equal to the DC of the spell.

Duration 1 round/level

Description

You create a disk of sunlight on one arm. Any creature that strikes you with a melee attack deals normal damage, but also takes 1d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level. Half of this damage is fire damage and half is holy damage (as the spell flame strike). An undead creature or a creature particularly vulnerable to light that hits you instead takes 2d6 points of damage +1 point per caster level. Creatures with reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. The shield provides illumination equivalent to a daylight spell. You can have only one instance of this spell in effect at a time. It does not stack with similar damaging aura spells such as fire shield or shield of the Dawnflower (The Inner Sea World Guide 296).
