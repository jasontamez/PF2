Description

A spiraling twister of tornado-force wind surges forth from your palm, unbalancing those it rushes over. Creatures on the ground within the area are knocked prone. A flying creature within the spell's area must instead succeed at a DC 25 Fly check or plummet to the ground, taking the appropriate amount of falling damage. Creatures that are Huge or larger in size gain a +2 bonus on their Reflex saves, while creatures that are Medium or smaller in size take a -2 penalty.

Additionally, the area is subjected to tornado-force winds, extinguishing all nonmagical flames, dispersing clouds, and scattering unattended objects.
