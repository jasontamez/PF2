Description

Prized among those who seek to monitor the attention paid to them, this spell is said to be used by <a href="deitydisplayea52.html?ItemName=Arazni">Arazni</a> to identify those followers who dare refer to her as "the Harlot Queen" so she might summarily dismiss them. When you cast this spell, designate a word, phrase, or name. If a creature within 1 mile of you uses that word, phrase, or name to refer to you, you immediately learn that creature's name, appearance, and location. This discharges the spell.
