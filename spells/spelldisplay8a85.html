Description

You conjure an invisible team of tiny engineers to construct a trap at
alarming speed. Originating at your location, the team must remain
within range of you or the spell ends. The engineers construct a
mechanical trap of your choice. Construction takes a number of
rounds equal to the trap's challenge rating. The engineers must
have the materials available. At the end of the construction time,
use your Craft (traps) skill with a +5 bonus to determine the success
of their work. If the engineers succeed, the trap is complete and the
spell ends. If they fail, the materials are deposited at that location
and the spell ends. If the spell's duration ends before the trap is
complete, the engineers automatically fail.

The engineers move at your base speed and can carry only
materials required in the construction of the desired trap. They can't
attack in any way or be killed, and dissipate if they take 12 points
of damage from area attacks (they get no saves against attacks).
