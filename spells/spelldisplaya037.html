Description

Protection from energy grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.

Protection from energy overlaps (and does not stack with) resist energy. If a character is warded by protection from energy and resist energy, the protection spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

Effect

Range touch
Targets creatures touched
Duration 10 min./level or until discharged

Description

This spell functions like protection from energy, except you divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the creatures touched. Once the spell absorbs 12 points of energy damage per caster level (maximum 120 points) for a subject, the spell's effects end for that subject.
