Description

You launch an ingot of iron at the target. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the target's skeleton or exoskeleton turns into jagged shards of cold iron. Whenever the target moves, it takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and is sickened for 1 round as metal spines stab into its flesh. This damage is subject to damage reduction, but it overcomes damage reduction as though it were a weapon of cold iron and magic. A creature affected by this spell can choose to remain motionless to avoid taking damage. Creatures with DR/cold iron or DR/cold iron and magic affected by this spell are nauseated instead of sickened. This spell has no effect on a creature that has neither a skeleton nor a hard carapace.
