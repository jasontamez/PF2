Target you and one animal companion within 30 ft.

Description

You affect yourself and a single animal companion within 30 feet of you. Both you and the animal companion gain darkvision to 100 feet, tremorsense to 20 feet, and a 40-foot enhancement bonus to movement. Furthermore, you can track while moving at full speed without taking any penalty. If you already have the ability to track at full speed, you gain a +4 bonus on Survival checks while tracking instead.

The duration of this spell immediately ends if you or the animal companion attack another creature or are attacked by another creature.
