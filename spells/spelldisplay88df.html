Description

The subject temporarily ceases to feel the ill effects of a single ongoing affliction or condition from the following list: blinded, cursed, dazed, deafened, diseased, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, poisoned, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. If that affliction or condition has a duration, it is suspended until this spell expires. If the subject has multiple instances of the same type of affliction (such as multiple diseases), a single casting of this spell can suspend only one of them. Placebo effect doesn't remove or temporarily negate any damage that the affliction may have already caused, nor does it provide protection against receiving such conditions again.
