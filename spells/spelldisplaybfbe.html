Description

Azata champions developed this spell to deal with fiends with
unknown resistances. A ray of spiraling colors springs from
your hand and streaks to its target. You must make a successful
ranged touch attack to hit your target with the ray, which deals
2d6 points of acid damage, 2d6 points of cold damage, 2d6
points of electricity damage, and 2d6 points of fire damage.
The type of energy that does the most points of damage to the
target then persists, dealing another 4d6 points of that type of
damage per round for 1d4 rounds.
