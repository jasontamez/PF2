Description

This spell allows you to channel the essence of Cayden Cailean's philosophy, giving you the benefits of a freedom of movement spell and granting you a +4 bonus on saving throws against fear effects. The spell also makes you drunk. For the duration of the spell, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and concentration checks. If you somehow remove or avoid these penalties, the spell's duration ends.
