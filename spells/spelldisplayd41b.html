Description

You cause an object to briefly transform into gold. Affected items gain the properties of gold (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 53) until the spell expires. Weapons reduce their hardness by half and gain the fragile quality, while piercing and slashing weapons take a -2 penalty on damage rolls (minimum 1 damage). This spell increases the affected item's armor check penalty by 2 and decreases its armor or shield bonus by 2. Gold armor has hardness 5.
