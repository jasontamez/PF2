Description

Your spell slowly begins to eat away at the defenses of your target.
If the target fails its saving throw, it loses 1 point from any damage
reduction and natural armor bonus it may have. If the initial save
was not successful, the target may attempt a new saving throw
each round for the duration of the spell or continue to suffer
cumulative losses. If the first save fails but a subsequent save
succeeds, the eroding effects stop at that point, though any of the
penalties already accrued remain until the spell expires. At the end
of the spell's duration, the target's damage reduction and natural
armor bonus immediately return to normal.

Only one erode defenses spell can affect a particular target
at any one time.
