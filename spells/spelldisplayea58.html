Description

You attempt to destroy any one robot in range. When you cast this spell, your hand crackles with electricity. You must succeed at a ranged touch attack to affect the target. The target takes 12d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level, or 3d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level on a successful saving throw. A cyborg or android can be damaged by this spell, but takes half damage and gains a +4 bonus on the saving throw to resist the spell's effects.
