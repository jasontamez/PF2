Description

This spell functions like gaseous form, except the target becomes a visible swirl of hot ash and smoke instead of harmless translucent gas. The target gains the fire subtype. Any creature that begins its turn sharing a space with the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage and must make a Fortitude save (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or suffer the effects of smoke inhalation.

Mythic Scorching Ash Form

The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as mythic gaseous form.

Augmented: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of scorching ash form as a move action.
