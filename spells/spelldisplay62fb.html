Description

You conjure a herd of aurochs or similar herd animal that
immediately stampedes in the direction you indicate. The herd
takes up a 20-foot-radius space and moves at a rate of 120
feet per round in a straight line. Any creatures caught in the
herd's path take 4d6+9 points of damage that round as they
are trampled beneath dozens of animals' hooves. A successful
Reflex save halves this damage.


If the stampede's path would put it in an obviously
dangerous area (such as over a cliff or through a fire) or force it
to move through a solid barrier, the herd stops at the obstacle
and moves in a new randomly determined direction until it
reaches another obstacle or the spell's duration ends.
