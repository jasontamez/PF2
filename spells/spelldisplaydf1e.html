Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)

Effect

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one living creature
Duration 1 hour/level or until completed
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes

Description

You influence the actions of the target creature by suggesting a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two). The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. Asking the creature to do some obviously harmful act automatically negates the effect of the spell.

The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

A very reasonable suggestion causes the save to be made with a penalty (such as -1 or -2).

Mythic Suggestion

Mythic suggestion loses the language-dependent descriptor, and can target one or more living creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst.

Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S

Effect

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one living creature
Duration 1 hour/level or until completed (D)

Description

This spell functions as per suggestion, except the target can pass on the enchantment to other targets. The target is compelled to communicate your suggestion to another creature, forcing the new target to attempt a saving throw as if it were the initial target. If a secondary target successfully saves, the suggestion effect on the initial target isn't negated. If a secondary target fails, it is placed under the same compulsion as the initial target and can further spread the suggestion. This spell can affect a total number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to your caster level. Creatures that save against this spell cannot be affected by that particular casting of contagious suggestion for 24 hours.

Casting

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, M (a snake's tongue and a honeycomb)

Effect

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Target one living creature
Duration 1 day/level or until completed
Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance  yes

Description

This spell functions as suggestion, except you can use it only to specify a condition that triggers a special activity, and the subject does not remember that you made the suggestion. For example, you could use triggered suggestion on a palace guard to make him attack the king the next time he and the king are alone, and the guard would not remember the suggestion to do so until the trigger occurred.
