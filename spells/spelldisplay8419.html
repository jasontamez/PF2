Description

This spell causes an ally made of pure force to appear in a single 5-foot square within range. The ally takes the form of a servant of your god (if any) or an ancestor. The spiritual squire occupies its space, though you and your allies can move through it, since it is your ally. While the spiritual squire appears to wear armor and carry a weapon, it cannot make attacks and does not threaten any spaces. On your turn, the spiritual squire can do one of the following: retrieve one stowed item from your possessions, carry an object weighing no more than 10 pounds per caster level, hand you an object it is carrying, perform the aid another action on your behalf or for one of your allies, or help one creature of your choice don armor (which then takes half the normal time). When the spiritual squire attempts the aid another action in combat, its attack bonus is equal to your base attack bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

Each round after the first as a swift action, you can order the spiritual squire to move. It has a speed of 30 feet. Being a construct of force, the spiritual squire cannot be harmed by any physical attacks, but disintegrate, dispel magic, a rod of cancellation, or a sphere of annihilation affects it. A spiritual ally's AC against touch attacks is 10.
