Description

You cause any diseased creatures in the area to become extremely contagious. Any affected creature is overcome by a fit of wracking coughs, causing it to become fatigued and exposing any creatures within 10 feet of the diseased creature to the diseases it carries. On a successful save, a creature is fatigued for 1 round and doesn't have a chance to infect nearby creatures.
