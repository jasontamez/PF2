Description

Alchemists have tried for centuries to recreate Artokus Kirran's feat of genius that created the sun orchid elixir. Although they have yet to unlock the elixir's exact formula, their efforts have not been entirely wasted. One by-product of their experiments was the orchid's drop formula. This extract, distilled from a much-diluted drop of the nectar of a sun orchid flower, can transform an alchemist's mutagen into a potent healing tonic.

As long as you're under the effects of orchid's drop, drinking a dose of your mutagen heals you of 2d10 points of damage. For the spell's duration, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on all saving throws.
