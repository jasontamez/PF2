Description

You create a glowing crimson line around the area. Against creatures in the area, you can attempt a number of additional attacks of opportunity per round equal to your spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for magi and wizards, Charisma for bloodragers and sorcerers), although this does not allow you to make more than one attack against a creature per action that provokes.
