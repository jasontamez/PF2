Description

You mingle the power of your mind and body to exert force beyond your reach. This spell functions as the combat maneuver version of telekinesis, except as noted above. Alternatively, you can inflict a telekinetic unarmed strike with this spell, using your own unarmed strike damage and applying your primary spellcasting ability score modifier to the damage in place of your Strength modifier.
