Description

You wreathe yourself in the quasi-real form of a dragon. You gain
two claw attacks (1d6 plus caster level slashing damage) and a bite
attack (1d8 plus caster level piercing damage). These are primary
attacks. In addition, you gain shadowy wings, granting you a fly
speed equal to your base speed (good maneuverability).

Your shadowy natural weapons are only half as strong as the
real things, though creatures that believe them to be real are
affected at full strength. A creature is permitted one Will save the
first time you strike it. If it succeeds, the creature takes half damage
from such attacks for the duration of the spell. If you overcome a
creature's spell resistance on your first attack, that creature remains
vulnerable for the spell's duration; otherwise, it's immune.
