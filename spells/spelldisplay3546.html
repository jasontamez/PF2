Description

You create a coil of flowing fresh water, functioning a whip appropriate for your size, except you make a melee touch attack instead of a regular attack. Anything you strike with the whip takes damage and is doused with 1 pint of water. A creature with the fire subtype takes an additional 1d6 points of damage. If the target is on fire, it gains a +2 bonus on its next saving throw to extinguish the flames.

After you have successfully used the whip to hit a creature a number of times equal to your caster level, the water is expended and the spell is discharged. The water created by this spell is otherwise identical to that produced by create water.
