Description

The target creature's blood becomes poisonous. Anytime the target takes piercing or slashing damage, a spray of acidic blood spurts from its body in the direction of the opponent who inflicted the wound. This blood travels in a 10-foot line, striking the first creature or object it touches. A creature struck by the blood is exposed to black adder venom and must save against the poison as normal, with a DC equal to the spell's DC.

Toxic blood can be made permanent with a permanency spell cast by a caster of 11th level or higher, at a cost of 7,500 gp.
