Description

You cause metal to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a successful Strength check to open, at your option). A vehicle grinds to a halt and ceases to operate. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon imposes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.

You can warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.

Alternatively, you can unwarp metal (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. Make whole, on the other hand, does nothing to repair a warped item.

You can combine multiple consecutive castings of warp metal to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single casting. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.
