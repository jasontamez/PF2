Effect

Range touch
Target unattended Tiny or Small object

Description

This spell functions as possession, except you possess an object instead of a creature.

A possessed object becomes capable of animation, gaining the statistics of an animated object of its size (including 1 CP worth of abilities; Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14). You can't use any spells or other abilities while possessing an object.

A spiritual tether connects your body to the possessed object, in a manner similar to a silver cord (see page 244). If the possessed object and your body are ever farther than close range (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) from one another, this tether breaks, returning your consciousness to your body.
