Description

This arrow ends in a crystalline bubble filled with a viscous alchemical dyeing agent. Firing a dye arrow is a ranged touch attack; a creature struck by a dye arrow takes no damage but is splashed with enough black, blue, green, or red marker dye (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 104) to coat about 1 square foot. The stain caused by marker dye cannot be washed off except with magic for the first 72 hours, but fades completely after 2 weeks.
