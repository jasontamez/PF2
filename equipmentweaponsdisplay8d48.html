Description

This long-barreled early firearm has a slim horizontal disk with eight uncovered slots, each of which can hold one bullet and 1 dose of black powder (but not alchemical cartridges). Each time the weapon is fired, the disk rotates to load the next available shot. Misfiring with a cylinder rifle causes rogue sparks to cause the gun to erratically fire all the remaining bullets loaded in the disk, and each stray bullet has a 50% chance to hit the wielder, dealing 1d6 points of damage. Reloading a cylinder rifle requires two full-round actions, regardless of the number of slots being loaded. The Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a single full-round action.
