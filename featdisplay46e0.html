You have a nearly endless arsenal of tricks and methods
to keep your buildings in top shape.


Prerequisites: Own at least one room.

Benefit:  When a room you own gains the broken
condition, you may repair it for half the normal cost
in gold pieces and other capital, rounded up (see page
90 of Ultimate Campaign). Additionally, buildings and
organizations you've created are not affected by capital
attrition (see page 81 of Ultimate Campaign) until 1 month
of your absence. From that point, capital attrition affects
your buildings and organizations as normal.
