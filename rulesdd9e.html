In a game that uses the <a href="rules93e5.html?Name=Limited%20Magic&amp;Catgeory=Spell%20Alterations">limited magic variant</a>, you can add esoteric components to take some of the sting out of the weakened spellcasting. It's best to include the components as described in the <a href="rulesfc96.html?Name=Optional%20Components&amp;Category=Implementing%20Esoteric%20Components">optional components variant</a>, rather than saddling spellcasters with both weakened spellcasting and decreased treasure.

Limited magic uses a fixed caster level, which acts as the baseline for casting a spell using esoteric components or gaining the greater component benef its. When used together, the esoteric components and limited magic systems also allow another option: expending esoteric components to gain the benefits of a higher CL or save DC. The specif ic limited magic benef it is listed under each component description. The caster must expend components whose value is equal to twice the esoteric component cost for his caster level (rather than the spell's minimum caster level) to gain the limited magic benefit. For example, a 6th-level wizard casting <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a> could gain the limited magic benef it by expending 36 gp worth of entropic resin.

As with greater component effects, expending multiple types of esoteric components can apply other limited magic effects, but requires a Spellcraft check. This option is deliberately more expensive to discourage casters from using it too routinely.

A spellcaster can choose to apply either greater component effects or limited magic effects-but not both-on the same casting of a spell.
