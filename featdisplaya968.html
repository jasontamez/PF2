With sweeping movements and brute force, you can use your net to put foes at a disadvantage.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net)</a>, <a href="featdisplay4c17.html?ItemName=Net%20Adept">Net Adept</a>, base attack bonus +3.

Benefit:  In melee, you can use a net to trip or disarm opponents instead of entangling them. You gain a +2 bonus on disarm checks made to use a net in this way. Further, if you have an opponent entangled in your net, you can attempt to drag or reposition that opponent as long as he is within your net's reach or you control the trailing rope on your net.

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, you can also use a net to drag or reposition an opponent.
