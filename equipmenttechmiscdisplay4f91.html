Description

A jetpack consists of a pair of cylindrical tanks worn on a shoulder harness with a pair of motion-sensitive rings worn on the thumbs that are used as wireless thrust and attitude controls. The jetpack can be activated as a swift action and grants a fly speed of 60 feet with poor maneuverability. If the wearer successfully hovers near ground level, she obscures visibility as though she had the Hover feat (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 315). The exhaust isn't hot or concentrated enough to be used as a weapon.

A jetpack can be operated in overdrive, giving the wearer a fly speed of 90 feet with clumsy maneuverability and consuming twice as many charges per round.

While it is normally possible to wear an item in the shoulders slot as well as an item on the back, a jetpack's bulk precludes the wearer also using a backpack, handy haversack, or other items worn on the back.
