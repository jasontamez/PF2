Description

This spell works like maze, except the DC of the Intelligence check to escape is 22 and each round a creature remains in the maze a different effect occurs depending on which section of the maze it is in. Roll on the following table each time the creature attempts an Intelligence check to escape the maze to see which part of the maze it wanders through; if a creature doesn't attempt an Intelligence check, it stays in the same section and suffers that section's effects. Any conditions or damage taken persist for the listed duration even if the creature exits the maze before then, but conditions don't stack with themselves. <table class="inner"><tr><td>d%</td><td>Maze Section</td></tr> <tr><td>1-20</td><td>Circus</td></tr> <tr><td>21-40</td><td>Haunted forest</td></tr> <tr><td>41-60</td><td>Hellscape</td></tr> <tr><td>61-80</td><td>Oasis of respite</td></tr> <tr><td>81-100</td><td>Strange city</td></tr></table>

Circus: The creature finds itself in a nightmarish circus of giant beasts, garishly painted faces, and hideous, mocking laughter. The creature must succeed at a Will save or gain a lesser madness (see page 182). The save uses the madness's normal DC.

Haunted Forest: The creature travels through a dark forest of grasping trees while shadowy beasts prowl at the edge of its vision. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. This is a fear effect. A frightened creature can still attempt Intelligence checks to escape the maze, but it takes 3d6 points of slashing and piercing damage from the trees' branches.

Hellscape: The creature navigates a landscape of fire and stone walls carved with diabolical faces while the cries of the damned echo in the air. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become paralyzed by fear and potential torment for 1 round. This is a fear effect. The creature can't attempt to escape the maze while paralyzed, and if it fails three consecutive saving throws against this paralysis, the hellscape delivers a coup de grace, dealing the creature 4d6 points of fire damage. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die. A creature that survives the coup de grace escapes from the paralysis as well.

Oasis of Respite: Whether it appears as a beautiful glade, a perfumed palace, or a literal desert oasis, this section of the maze is supernaturally peaceful, especially in comparison to the rest of the maze. The creature must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. The creature can't attempt to escape the maze while fascinated. A creature that fails three consecutive saving throws to this fascination enters a state of lethargy and gives up ever escaping the maze, remaining in this area until the spell ends on its own in 10 minutes (as per maze).

Strange City: The creature journeys through a city of cyclopean architecture under a sky of indescribable color and numerous stars. The creature must succeed at a Will save or take 2d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), the creature instead takes 2d10 points of sanity damage.
