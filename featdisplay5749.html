Benefit:  On your turn, you can perform a single drag combat maneuver (Advanced Players Guide 320) in place of one of your melee attacks. You must choose the melee attack with the highest base attack bonus to make the drag.

Normal:  A drag combat maneuver is a standard action.

You can spend 2 stamina points to change an attack that does not have your highest base attack bonus into a drag combat maneuver. You can use this combat trick only once per round, but you can use it even if you already used your attack at the highest base attack bonus to drag.
