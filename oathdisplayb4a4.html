Despite the seemingly inherent contradiction, the militant Hellknights of Cheliax count a number of paladins among their ranks, especially the Order of the Godclaw. Typically these paladins reconcile their allegiance to the Hellknights by dedication to the rule of law above all other things.

Detect Chaos (Su): This ability works like the standard paladin ability to detect evil, except as detect chaos instead of detect evil. This ability replaces detect evil.

Smite Chaos (Su): This ability works like the standard paladin ability to smite evil, except the paladin gains bonuses against targets with chaotic alignments instead of evil. The paladin deals additional damage against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned dragons, and aberrations, instead of against evil outsiders, evil dragons, and undead. This ability replaces smite evil.

Order of Good (Su): When an oathbound paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the ability to spend one use of her lay on hands ability when using her smite chaos ability to instead smite evil, as the paladin ability of the same name. This ability replaces channel positive energy.

Code of Conduct: Spread the order of law wherever you go, so long as the law is just; do not serve as a tool of tyranny. Fight vigilantly the servants of chaos.

Oath Spells: 1st-command; 2nd-calm emotions; 3rd- suggestion; 4th-order's wrath.
