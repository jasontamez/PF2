The creature regains hit points swiftly, usually 1 or more per round, as given in the creature's entry. Except as noted below, fast healing is just like natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost from starvation, suffocation, or thirst, nor does it allow a creature to regrow lost body parts. Unless otherwise stated, it does not allow lost body parts to be reattached. Fast healing continues to function (even at negative hit points) until a creature dies, at which point the effects of fast healing end immediately.
