Description

These Tiny beasts are allegedly sold for indoor defense to rich clients, but often wind up in exotic blood sports. Despite the popular misconception that stirges are untameable vermin, such creatures are trainable, but they must be fed fresh blood daily to dissuade them from turning on their handlers. More information about stirges can be found in the Bestiary.
