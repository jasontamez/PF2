Colossi are mythic constructs of Gargantuan size or larger. Unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry, colossi have the following traits. <ul><li>Alternate Form (Ex): Colossi have the ability to transform themselves into some other shape. This transformation is nonmagical, and is not revealed by <a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a> or similar magic. </li><li>Mythic Creation (Ex): A colossus can be created only by a creator with a mythic tier or rank equal to or greater than that of the colossus it is attempting to create. </li><li>Mythic Quickening (Sp): As a swift action, a colossus can expend one use of mythic power to cast or activate one of its spell-like abilities as a free action. </li><li>Mythic Resilience (Ex): A colossus can expend one use of mythic power as swift action to double its damage resistance for 1 round. </li><li>Pinning Stomp (Ex): When a colossus is in its normal form, as a swift action it can make a single melee attack at its highest base attack against a target three or more size categories smaller than the colossus. This attack deals an amount of damage equal to twice that of its slam attack + 1-1/2 times the colossus's Strength bonus. If the colossus hits with this attack, it can attempt a grapple check as a free action. This grapple doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the grapple is successful, the target is pinned and takes an amount of damage equal to that of the colossus's slam attack each round at the start of the colossus's turn until either the pinned creature frees itself or the colossus moves out of the pinned creature's space. The colossus doesn't need to attempt grapple checks to continue the pin, nor can it attempt a check to move, further damage, or tie up the grappled creature. A colossus can have at most two creatures pinned with this attack at one time. </li><li>Selective Antimagic Aura (Su): A colossus exudes a constant <a href="spelldisplay8db6.html?ItemName=antimagic%20field">antimagic field</a>, as the spell, with a radius equal to its reach. Typically, this field ignores specified schools of magic or spell descriptors. A colossus's own spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities are not affected by this aura.</li></ul>
