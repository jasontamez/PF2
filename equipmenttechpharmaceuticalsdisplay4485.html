Description

This potent drug can revive a recently deceased victim. If administered to a corpse within 1 minute of death, the victim can immediately attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 15 + 1 per round since death occurred) to be restored to life, automatically stabilizing at -1 hit point. Multiple doses injected within this 1-minute period can grant the deceased additional attempts at revival; each additional dose grants a cumulative +2 bonus to the Fortitude saving throw. As with most other effects that revive the dead, a creature restored to life in this manner gains 1 negative level. Cardioamp only works on bodies that are relatively intact. Bodies that have been dismembered, horribly burned, or otherwise mutilated (at the GM's discretion) cannot be revived by cardioamp, but bodies slain by death effects can be.

Cardioamp can be deadly if injected into a living creature. A living creature injected with cardioamp must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw to resist taking 3d6 points of Constitution damage from a sudden heart attack. If the save is successful, the Constitution damage is negated but the victim becomes sickened for 1d6 rounds. The effect when injected in a living creature is a poison effect.
