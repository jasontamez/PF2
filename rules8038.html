Surreptitiously stealing an item from a creature requires a successful DC 20 Finesse check. The opponent attempts an opposed Perception check against the result of your Finesse check. If she succeeds, she notices your attempt regardless of whether you got the item. You can't attempt to pilfer an object during combat from a creature that's aware of your presence.

Action: Standard, or move at a -20 penalty.

Try Again: Yes, but a second attempt against the same target increases the DC by 10.
