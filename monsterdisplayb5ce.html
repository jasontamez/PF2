Description

These creatures are the result of magical draconic experiments at crossbreeding wyverns and kobolds. Wyvarans are fiercely territorial creatures loyal to their kin and tribe, and allow no interlopers into their lands without good reason or proper tribute. Each defends its personal property, and seeks revenge on any who dare steal from it. Most evil and neutral wyvarans primarily concern themselves with expanding their territory and wealth.

Many civilized races dismiss wyvarans as fast, dumb, selfish brutes. However, a creature who respects the wyvarans' rules about their property finds that they make steadfast and loyal allies. Adventuring wyvarans often view their companions as clutchmates, and are willing to take great risks to protect them.
