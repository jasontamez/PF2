Description

As a swift action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to increase the weapon's enhancement bonus by half his mythic tier (minimum 1, to a maximum of a +6 enhancement bonus) and give it the ability to bypass damage reduction. These benefits last for 1 round. Melee and ranged weapons can have this ability, but not ammunition.
