You can protect yourself with your shield, even if you use it to attack.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay87c6.html?ItemName=Shield%20Proficiency">Shield Proficiency.</a>

Benefit: When you perform a shield bash, you may still apply the shield's shield bonus to your AC.

Normal: Without this feat, a character that performs a shield bash loses the shield's shield bonus to AC until his next turn (see Equipment).

When attempting a shield bash attack, you can spend 5 stamina points to either wield a heavy shield as if it were a light weapon or gain a +2 bonus on the shield bash attack roll with a light shield. Whichever option you choose, the effect lasts until the start of your next turn.
