Description

This ornate, crested helmet of gold is typical of those worn by palace and household guards in and around Xin-Shalast. Topped with a brush of platinum bristles and filigreed with silver around the rim and nose guard, the golden helm is as much a display of wealth and status as it is a powerful magic tool. When donning a golden helm of Xin-Shalast, the wearer takes on the appearance of a masterfully sculpted golden statue. This change is purely cosmetic, except for 10 minutes per day when the owner can activate the effects of an iron body spell. The iron body effect can be activated as a free action.
