Description

Made from specially crafted materials, a dowsing rod is used by the psychically attuned to locate water, find graves, or uncover minerals. Most commonly manufactured from forked branches cut from hazel, peach, or willow trees, dowsing rods can also come in other forms, such as bent, L-shaped rods of charged cold iron. Though a dowser can use any forked twig found in nature for dowsing, these specially prepared rods provide a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks for the dowsing occult skill unlock.
