Corruptions









Corruptions

Even the most pure creature can succumb to tides of darkness. What begins as a minor malady or errant idea can grow into something malignant-a spreading corruption that can obscure your morals, cloud your judgment, and ultimately devour your soul. There are a number of different types of corruptions, from the hunger of vampirism to the horrifying transformation of the promethean. Living with a corruption is often a terrifying experience, but also offers the temptation of dark gifts. Hosts sometimes choose not to fight the corruption, but rather accept it and allow it to progress. These unfortunate folk either succumb to lust for the corruption's power or attempt to control the stain of corruption and use its gifts for some greater good.<a href="rules415e.html?Name=Corruption&amp;Category=Horror%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Corruptions.</a>

Your body is slowly wasting away. As your body decays, you must gradually replace more and more of it with artificial components-corpse flesh, bone, wood, metal, or other exotic materials.


Catalyst

This corruption stems from experimentation designed to create or extend life-perhaps you were a willing participant in an alchemist's research or brought back from the dead by an unconventional means that robbed you of your humanity.


Progression

Whenever you fail a Fortitude save against any effect or fall below 0 hit points, you must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level). If you fail that save, some of the living components of your body begin to fail. Within the next 3 days, you or someone you trust must spend 8 hours replacing more of your body with construct parts. If you don't do so, you die, and even if you are brought back from the dead with <a href="spelldisplayd65d.html?ItemName=resurrection">resurrection</a> or <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a> (which are necessary since your body isn't viable), you still must perform the operation or you die again in 3 days. After an operation, there is a 50% chance your corruption progresses to the next stage. If it doesn't, the DC of the above Fortitude save increases by 2 until your corruption reaches the next stage. These increases stack.

While your body parts are failing (after you've failed the Fort save but before you've repaired your body), you don't have to attempt additional saves when you fail a Fortitude save or fall below 0 hit points. Once you've been repaired, you need to attempt saves in these circumstances again.
Corruption Stage 1: The first time your corruption progresses, you fall into routines easily, performing repetitive actions. Your alignment shifts one step toward neutral.
Corruption Stage 2: The second time your corruption progresses, you find you can't bring yourself to care about things or even to love. Your alignment shifts to neutral.
Corruption Stage 3: The third time your corruption progresses, too much of your body is gone for your soul to remain. You become a mindless, destructive automaton or free-willed evil construct under the GM's control.


Removing the Corruption

Getting rid of a corruption requires invasive surgery to remove the artificial components fused to your body. Even these procedures might not cure your underlying wasting, so you might need to scour medical and alchemical tomes and consult divine spellcasters for a safer procedure than replacing your body parts in the way you were before. Powerful magic like <a href="spelldisplay2e34.html?ItemName=Miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplay5c8a.html?ItemName=Wish">wish</a> in conjunction with <a href="spelldisplay14c5.html?ItemName=Regenerate">regenerate</a> might strip the components from your body and prevent the wasting.

The only emotion left to you is rage.
Gift: You can voluntarily enter an enraged state as a free action for a number of rounds per day equal to your manifestation level; these rounds don't have to be consecutive. Once you end this state, you can't enter it again for 1 minute. While enraged, you gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, 1 temporary hit point per character level, and a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves. You are in control of yourself during this rage, but you must still succeed at a Will save to resist losing control (as detailed in this manifestation's stain). While voluntarily enraged, you take a -2 penalty on Will saves.
Stain: When you're hit by a critical hit or drop below half your maximum hit points, you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your manifestation level) or become enraged for a number of rounds equal to your manifestation level. You gain the benefits of this manifestation's gift, but you're completely out of control, making melee attacks against the nearest creature (roll randomly if there are multiple targets).
