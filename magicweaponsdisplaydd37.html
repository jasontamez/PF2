Description

This elegant, short-hafted spear has a razor-sharp head carved from a single piece of ivory. A twisting ring of ivory and jade tentacles hovers and slowly rotates just beneath the spearhead. Along the walnut haft sparkle tiny chips of peridot, each the size of a pinhead. Seaspike is a <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">+3 aberration bane shortspear</a> with three special properties.

First, the wielder of Seaspike can cast <a href="spelldisplay2025.html?ItemName=fire%20shield">fire shield</a> (chill) on herself three times per day as a 7th-level sorcerer. The chill shield takes the appearance of luminous blue and green flames that swirl around the wielder as if underwater.

Second, Seaspike grants its wielder a swim speed of 30 feet when held. If the wielder already has a swim speed, Seaspike increases the swim speed by 10 feet.

Third, Seaspike is treated as a light weapon for purposes of the <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a> feat and other similar abilities.
