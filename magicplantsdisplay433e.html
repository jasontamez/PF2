Description

This large deciduous tree has reddish-brown bark and bright yellow leaves. It grows misshapen red apples that are warm to the touch. Once harvested, an apple can be thrown like a bomb, bursting in a spray of scalding liquid. Treat this as a splash weapon that deals 5d6 points of fire damage to a target directly hit and half that amount to creatures within 10 feet (Reflex DC 14 negates).

A fireapple tree produces one apple each week of its growing season, which is 13 weeks each summer. A tree has no more than three viable fruit at a time.
