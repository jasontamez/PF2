Description

This whistle emits a loud, shrill note. Once per day when the user blows this whistle his mount or animal companion is instantly teleported to a safe space of the user's choice that's within 30 feet of him. The creature must be within 1 mile, and any effect that bars or hampers teleportation also impedes this effect. The whistle is useless unless attuned to a specific mount or animal companion; attuning the whistle is a special ritual that takes 10 minutes. The whistle can be attuned to a new mount or animal companion at will.
