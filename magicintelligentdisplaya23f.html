Description

This caster's shield always has one arcane scroll and knows
the same arcane spells as the wielder. When the spell on
the scroll is cast, another scroll of a spell the wielder knows
randomly manifests to replace it. The shield has no arcane
spell failure. The shield can also read magic. It will often
debate with its wielder for the most devastating course of
action, but does what the wielder commands.

Construction

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Scribe Scroll, creator must be an
arcane spellcaster of at least 14th level; Price 7,250 gp
