Your draconic heritage stems from a mighty, primordial linnorm rather than from the more common, somewhat civilized dragons.

Associated Bloodline: Draconic.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your linnorm bloodline's energy type, you gain a natural armor bonus equal to the spell's level for 1d4 rounds.

Bloodline Powers: True dragons blast their foes with rays of energy.

Elemental Spit (Su): Starting at 1st level, you can fire an elemental ray that matches your linnorm bloodline's energy type as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The ray deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This bloodline power replaces claws.
