Explorer (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yw2?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Quests-Campaigns">Quests and Campaigns pg. 10</a>
You dream of discovering new vistas.

Prerequisites: You must have crossed at least 30 miles of
wilderness without map or guide.

Benefit: You can provide twice as much food and
water for other people when attempting a Survival check
to get along in the wild. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus
on all Knowledge (geography) checks. If you have 10 or
more ranks in Knowledge (geography), increase your
bonus to +4.

Goal: Cross through a dangerous place without a
map or a guide knowledgeable about the area, stopping
for no longer than 16 hours at a time, and along the way
overcome an appropriate number of natural hazards,
obstacles, and/or enemies, at least one of which must
qualify as a challenging foe.

Completion Benefit: You and one ally per 3 ranks
of Survival can move overland without being slowed
by difficult terrain (allies must remain within 30 feet
of you to be affected). Once per day, you can make a
preternaturally accurate estimate regarding your path, as
if you had cast find the path on yourself (caster level equals
your character level).


Suggested Traits: Grim Optimism, Resilient,
Wanderlust.
