Hate-mongers are xenophobic and judgmental rabblerousers who whip up mobs against enemies real or imagined.

Alignment: A hate-monger must be of a nongood alignment. A hate-monger who becomes good cannot gain new levels as a mesmerist but retains all his class abilities.

Mental Manipulator (Ex): A hate-monger masters a broad repertoire of emotional corruption. At 1st level, he adds one spell from the 1st-level spells below to his spells known. When he would gain a new mesmerist trick, he can learn additional spells instead, adding two of the following spells of a level he can currently cast to his spells known: 1st-cause fear, compel hostility, delusional pride, demand offering, forbid action, lesser confusion, murderous command, scare, sow thought;  2nd-aversion, paranoia, rage, unadulterated loathing;  3rd- confusion, crushing despair, curse of disgust, fear, instant enemy, malicious spite, smug narcissism, spite;  4th-envious urge, feast on fear, greater forbid action, modify memory, utter contempt;  5th-foe to friend, foster hatred, song of discord, repress memory, unwilling shield, vengeful outrage;  6th- eyebite, insanity, overwhelming presence, symbol of persuasion. When he casts a spell he learns in this way, he increases the duration as if his caster level were 1 higher. Starting at 5th level, the save DC is increased by 1 for creatures of his favored enemy type.

This ability replaces consummate liar and alters mesmerist tricks.

Insidious Hatred (Su): At 3rd level, a hate-monger can sow hatred and strife under the pretense of assisting others. He can use his touch treatment only on others, but as part of the action of using touch treatment, he can cast any targeted spell from the mental manipulator list that does not have a range of "personal" and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less, targeting only the creature that receives his touch treatment. That creature doesn't realize the hatemonger has cast a spell, and considers any manifestations to be part of the touch treatment. Other creatures notice as normal. The target creature takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw and to its spell resistance against the spell.

This ability alters touch treatment.

Xenophobe (Ex): At 5th level, a hate-monger can choose one favored enemy, as per the ranger class feature. His favored enemy bonus begins at  and increases by 2 for every 4 mesmerist levels after 5th, but he does not gain additional favored enemies. His favored enemy bonus also applies on Intimidate checks against his favored enemy.

This ability replaces mental potency and manifold tricks.

Out for Blood (Ex): At 7th level, when a creature takes extra damage from the hate-monger's painful stare, it also takes 1 point of bleed damage (or 1 point of bleed damage per 1d6 points of damage dealt by the painful stare if the hatemonger damages the target himself ). This bleed damage does not stack with itself or other sources of bleed damage.

This ability replaces the 7th-level bold stare.

Insidious Emotions (Su): At 11th level, the power of a hatemonger's psychic hold becomes more difficult to detect or to break. The DC of Sense Motive checks to notice if a creature is under the effects of his enchantments with the emotion descriptor increases by 5 (if he also has the Subtle Enchantment feat, the effects stack), as does the DC to identify his emotion spells. Magical divinations can detect his emotion effects only if the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 11  the hate-monger's mesmerist level) as if the affected creatures were the subject of nondetection.

This ability replaces glib lie.
