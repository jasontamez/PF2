Improved Blind-Fight - Feats







Improved Blind-Fight (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 162</a>
Your keen senses guide your hand against hidden foes.

Prerequisites: Perception 10 ranks, <a href="featdisplay45f6.html?ItemName=Blind-Fight">Blind-Fight.</a>

Benefit:  Your melee attacks ignore the miss chance for less than total concealment. You may still reroll your miss chance percentile roll for total concealment.

If you successfully pinpoint an invisible or hidden attacker within 30 feet, that attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you with ranged attacks. That is, you don't lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker doesn't get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible.

Special:  The Improved Blind-Fight feat is of no use against a character who is the subject of a blink spell.

When attacking a foe with total concealment, you can spend 5 stamina points to treat that foe as having normal concealment (20% miss chance instead of 50%).
