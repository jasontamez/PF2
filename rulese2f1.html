The easiest way to choose spells for a monster is to select a spell list from among those on the following pages that best matches its theme, using the options in this chapter. A fey with powerful spell-like abilities might choose the enchantment, fey, nature, or trickery spell list. A wizard dedicated to flame might choose the fire spell list, a dedicated transmuter would likely pick the transmutation list, and a generalist might take the arcane or magic list.

When you choose a spell list, the monster gains the following sets of spells according to its CR band-the spellcasting range its CR falls into. <ul><li>The primary spells of its CR band, usable once per day. These are the monster's highest-level spells. </li><li>Both the primary and secondary spells of the CR band one step lower than its own CR band, usable three times per day. These account for the monster's less potent spells. </li><li>The primary spells of the CR band two steps below its own, usable at will. These are the monster's lowest-level spells.</li></ul> This setup produces a spellcaster with a small number of powerful spells that it can use rarely, a larger number of weaker but still useful spells that it can use often, and spells so weak that it hardly ever uses them in battle but can use them frequently.

Note that a CR 0-3 monster doesn't gain any at-will spells or any spells usable three times per day, and a CR 4-7 monster doesn't gain any at-will spells.

Write down the spells and the number of times they can be used. For the sample monsters later in this chapter, the spells are separated into attack spells, defensive spells, and utility spells, but this step is optional.

When you pick a spell list, the monster automatically gains the benefit listed at the bottom of that spell list. If you choose to create your own spell list, choose the benefit that matches your monster best, or create your own benefit for that monster instead.

For example, a CR 9 monster using the aberrant spell list would gain <a href="featdisplay7e0b.html?ItemName=feeblemind">feeblemind</a> and <a href="featdisplaybd46.html?ItemName=spell%20resistance">spell resistance</a> once per day each (from the 8-11 CR band); <a href="spelldisplaya05c.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20I">beast shape I</a>, <a href="spelldisplay2667.html?ItemName=major%20image">major image</a>, <a href="spelldisplayea94.html?ItemName=acid%20arrow">acid arrow</a>, and <a href="spelldisplaybdc5.html?ItemName=see%20invisibility">see invisibility</a> three times per day each (from the 4-7 CR band); and <a href="spelldisplayb54a.html?ItemName=cause%20fear">cause fear</a> and <a href="spelldisplay5b5f.html?ItemName=long%20arm">long arm</a> usable at will (from the 0-3 CR band). It would also gain the spell list's benefit: the fortification universal monster rule.



In-Depth Spell Choice

These lists are arranged to facilitate maximum speed in choosing spells, but you can choose spells individually, give the monster secondary spells in place of primary spells (which is why the CR 16+ band lists secondary spells), or mix and match at your discretion. To keep your monster balanced, don't deviate too far from the number of spells listed for its power level, though you can decrease or increase the number of spells within reason.

If you want to pick spells one by one, use the following spell levels for each CR band.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>CR Band</td><td>Spell Level</td></tr><tr><td>0-3</td><td>0 or 1st</td></tr><tr><td>4-7</td><td>2nd or 3rd</td></tr><tr><td>8-11</td><td>4th or 5th</td></tr><tr><td>12-15</td><td>6th or 7th</td></tr><tr><td>16+</td><td>8th or 9th</td></tr></table>
