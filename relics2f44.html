This illustrious pendant, forged from Elysian bronze, bears the likeness of a single closed and winged eye. The pendant is encrusted with hundreds of valuable gemstones that seem to twinkle even in the absence of light.

Tethered to a simple leather cord, this Elysian bronze pendant resembles the holy symbol of <a href="deitydisplaycee4.html?ItemName=Aroden">Aroden</a>, save that it bears the likeness of a closed eye surrounded by a halo of precious gems. In addition to functioning as a holy symbol of Aroden, the Grace of the Last Azlanti is imbued with the very essence of the human spirit. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to gain one of the following feats as a bonus feat for 1 hour: <a href="featdisplay51bc.html?ItemName=Great%20Fortitude">Great Fortitude</a>, <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b12.html?ItemName=Lightning%20Reflexes">Lightning Reflexes</a>, or <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus</a>. If the wearer already has <a href="featdisplay51bc.html?ItemName=Great%20Fortitude">Great Fortitude</a>, <a href="featdisplayc786.html?ItemName=Iron%20Will">Iron Will</a>, or <a href="featdisplay7b12.html?ItemName=Lightning%20Reflexes">Lightning Reflexes</a>, she can instead gain the improved version of that feat. If the wearer already has the improved version of one of these feats, she can instead spend one daily use of the Grace of the Last Azlanti to regain her daily use of that feat.

Worthiness


Task To be worthy of this relic, you must accomplish an incredible deed with the express purpose of defending humanity from enslavement, harm, or a similar threat. For example, defeating a lieutenant of the <a href="mythicmonsterdisplay8929.html?ItemName=The%20Whispering%20Tyrant">Whispering Tyrant</a> whose CR is equal to or greater than your level + 3 is an appropriate task. You are not worthy of this relic if you complete this task by orchestrating events that lead to this situation, as determined by the GM.

Benefit The wearer can activate the amulet three times per day. She can activate the amulet before the duration expires to replace the previously selected feat with another choice. In addition, the wearer can select from more feats when using this ability, adding <a href="featdisplay4e19.html?ItemName=Expanded%20Arcana">Expanded Arcana</a> to the list as well as all feats with "Extra" in their name'such as <a href="featdisplay86c7.html?ItemName=Extra%20Channel">Extra Channel</a>, <a href="featdisplay7a8c.html?ItemName=Extra%20Rage%20Power">Extra Rage Power</a>, <a href="featdisplay9665.html?ItemName=">Extra Rogue Talent</a>, and so on- that list as a prerequisite a class feature the wearer has. When conveying the benefits of a feat with "Extra" in its name, the duration of the amulet's effect is only 10 minutes.
