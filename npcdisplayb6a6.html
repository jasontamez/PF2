Tactics

Before Combat The druid casts barkskin and bull's strength.
During Combat The druid is well aware of his physical shortcomings, and wild shapes into a Medium air elemental the first chance he gets to escape melee combat. Once at a safe altitude, he casts wind wall and freedom of movement. If still threatened, he casts offensive spells such as flame strike or sleet storm, or uses his Weather domain spell-like abilities. If targeted by spellcasters, he casts fog cloud to obscure vision. If forced into melee, he casts greater magic fang before wild shaping into a Huge animal (preferably a triceratops or an orca).

With their ability to control and harness the powers of winds and storms, a number of druids become sea captains, using their abilities sometimes for trade and other times for piracy.

Edal

Edal is the captain of the Unlucky Halfling, a pirate vessel that harasses busy sea-lanes. The ship is named in honor of Edal himself, who had the misfortune of losing an eye and four fingers to a voracious reefclaw during his youth. He is a thrill-seeker, willing to sail seas that most other captains avoid. He feels at home in the middle of a huge storm.

Combat Encounters: Edal is most often found on his ship, along with his crew. When his crew is diminished, he sails in to a port, where he leads press gangs to round up new crew members.

Roleplaying Suggestions: A thrill-seeker by nature, Edal is quick to tell a bawdy joke, accept a dare, or even start a tavern brawl so that he can prove his mettle.
