Dragon Shaman

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 37</a>
Your totem is the legendary dragon, fearsome and deadly yet cunning and wise, a creature born of pure magic and raw elemental fury, bound within a shell of fangs, claws, and scales that few dare to challenge. Though your initial focus is on dragons' mundane cousins, as your powers grow you become attuned to actual dragons.

Nature Bond:  A dragon shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a crocodile or monitor lizard. If choosing a domain, the dragon shaman must choose from the Air, Animal, Destruction, Earth, Fire, War, and Water domains.

Wild Empathy (Ex):  A dragon shaman can use her wild empathy ability with lizards as a full-round action with a +4 bonus.

Totem Transformation (Su):  At 2nd level, a dragon shaman may adopt an aspect of the dragon while retaining her normal form. She gains one of the following bonuses: movement (fly speed 30 feet [average], the druid must be 5th level to select this bonus), senses (low-light vision, +4 racial bonus to Perception), toughness (+2 natural armor bonus to AC, Endurance feat), or natural weapons (bite [1d6] and 2 claws [1d4] for a Medium shaman, +2 bonus on CMB on grapple checks). While using totem transformation, the dragon shaman may speak normally and can cast speak with animals (lizards only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The dragon shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.

Totemic Summons (Su):  At 5th level, a dragon shaman may cast summon nature's ally as a standard action when summoning lizards, and summoned lizards gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any lizard to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

Wild Shape (Su):  At 6th level, a dragon shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level - 4. If she takes on the form of a lizard, she instead uses her unmodified druid level.

Dragon Bite (Su):  At 8th level, a dragon shaman's bite attack (whether using totem transformation or wild shape to take the form of a lizard) deals +1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). She chooses what kind of energy damage that she deals each time she bites. This ability replaces the additional use of wild shape at 8th level.

Bonus Feat:  At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a dragon shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: Combat Casting, Dazzling Display, Magical Aptitude, Skill Focus (Knowledge [arcana]), and Spell Penetration. She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.
