You can strike at enemy spellcasters who fail to cast defensively when you threaten them.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay26bb.html?ItemName=Disruptive">Disruptive</a>, 10th-level fighter.

Benefit: Enemies in your threatened area that fail their checks to cast spells defensively provoke attacks of opportunity from you.

Normal: Enemies that fail to cast spells defensively do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

When you hit a caster with an attack of opportunity it provoked by failing to cast defensively, you can spend 5 stamina points to daze the caster until the end of its next turn. If the caster succeeds at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10 + your base attack bonus, it is staggered instead.

Mythic Spellbreaker

You're a spellcaster's worst nightmare.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7d96.html?ItemName=Spellbreaker">Spellbreaker.</a>

Benefit:  Any non-mythic creature you threaten provokes an attack of opportunity from you whenever it uses a spell or spell-like ability, even when casting defensively or casting a quickened spell.

If a non-mythic creature within 30 feet of you uses a spell or spell-like ability, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a ranged attack against that creature as an attack of opportunity (even if the creature wouldn't normally provoke attacks of opportunity). You must have a ranged weapon in hand or have a free hand and the nonmythic Quick Draw feat to use this ability. You can use this ability against a mythic creature by expending two uses of mythic power.
