Description

This is an extra pocket sewn on the inside of a piece of clothing. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Sleight of Hand checks to conceal an item in an inside pocket. Detecting the compartment requires a successful DC 15 Perception check at minimum (DC 20 if empty), even if you aren't trained in Sleight of Hand.

The inside pocket is 1 inch deep. Different styles open from the top or from the side, and some have button flaps to secure the contents.
