Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

This ritual is used to create a loyal servant and spy for the coven: a <a href="monsterdisplay86cf.html?ItemName=Hag%20Eye%20Ooze">hag eye ooze</a>. Before the ritual can begin, the primary caster must spend 2 weeks carefully preparing an alchemical stew of animal organs, poisonous plants, and potent liquors.

Once the brew is prepared, the casters begin a 4-hour ritual of chanting around the bubbling cauldron. At the ritual's end, the eye of a hag or witch-ideally the primary caster-is added to the cauldron (using an eye from anyone not participating in the ritual increases all skill check DCs by 5). If the ritual is successful, the noxious fluid in the cauldron animates into a hag eye ooze loyal to the ritual's primary caster.
