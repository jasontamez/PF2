Whether studying at the feet of psychopomps or merely imitating the creatures' philosophy and methods, soul shepherds believe in safeguarding the Cycle of Souls.

Calming Strike (Su): As an immediate action after hitting an incorporeal undead creature with an unarmed strike, a soul shepherd can attempt to calm the creature, encouraging it to move peacefully to the next stage of its metaphysical journey. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half soul shepherd's level + the soul shepherd's Wisdom modifier) or be calmed, as <a href="spelldisplayb361.html?ItemName=calm%20spirit">calm spirit</a>, for 1 minute.

The soul shepherd can use this ability against a haunt by making a touch attack against an AC of 10 + the haunt's CR. A haunt does not receive a saving throw against this ability, but the ability's duration changes to concentration + 1 round, up to 1 round per level. A soul shepherd can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his soul shepherd level.

This replaces stunning fist.

Otherworldly Resilience (Ex): At 2nd level, a soul shepherd gains DR 2/adamantine, cold resistance 5, and electricity resistance 5. At 9th level, this improves to DR 5/adamantine, cold resistance 10, and electricity resistance 10.

This replaces evasion and improved evasion.

Spirit Sense (Su): At 12th level, a soul shepherd can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to grant himself the ability to notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 30 feet, just as if he had a <a href="monstersubtypes01d9.html?ItemName=Psychopomp">psychopomp's spiritsense ability</a> for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).

This replaces abundant step.

Yamaraj's Judgment (Sp): At 15th level, a soul shepherd can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a standard action to attempt to free an enslaved soul from an effect that is imprisoning it, such as <a href="spelldisplayd114.html?ItemName=soul%20bind">soul bind</a> or <a href="spelldisplay30a6.html?ItemName=trap%20the%20soul">trap the soul</a>. This functions as a targeted <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a> spell with a caster level equal to the soul shepherd's level. He can spend an additional ki point when he activates this ability to gain a +4 bonus on the caster level check. If the soul is held prisoner by a creature or a non-spell effect, the soul shepherd frees it if his caster level check result is at least 11 + the creature or effect's CR.

This replaces quivering palm.
