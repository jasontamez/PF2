Improved Critical (Combat)

Attacks made with your chosen weapon are quite deadly.

Prerequisites: Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +8.

Benefit: When using the weapon you selected, your threat range is doubled.

Special: You can gain Improved Critical multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.

When you hit with an attack and the roll fails to threaten a critical hit by 3 or less, you can spend 5 stamina points to attempt to deal double damage anyway. Roll as if confirming a critical hit. If this confirmation roll succeeds, your attack is still not a critical hit, but it deals double damage.

Mythic Improved Critical

Your critical strikes with your chosen weapon are deadlier than most.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay11f4.html?ItemName=Improved%20Critical">Improved Critical</a>, base attack bonus +8.

Benefit:  Your critical multiplier with your chosen weapon is increased by 1 (to a maximum of ??6).

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different non-mythic Improved Critical feat.
