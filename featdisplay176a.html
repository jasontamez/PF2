You have heightened awareness of enemies on all sides.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, base attack bonus +3.

Benefit: Flanking creatures do not gain a +2 bonus to attack you (this does not prevent you from being sneak attacked or denied your Dexterity bonus). A condition that makes you lose your Dex bonus to AC also makes you lose the benefits of this feat.

Normal: Flanking opponents gain a +2 flanking bonus to hit.
