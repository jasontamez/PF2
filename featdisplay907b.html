Under your leadership, the time required to assemble and move a siege engine is greatly reduced.

Prerequisites: Craft (siege weapon) 5 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 5 ranks or Profession (siege engineer) 1 rank.

Benefit:  When you lead a siege engine assembly crew, you grant all of its members a +4 competence bonus on checks to assemble or move the weapon. You also halve the time required to assemble a siege engine.

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, when you lead a siege engine assembly crew, even those among the crew who are not trained in Craft (siege engine) can take 10 on the check to assemble the siege engine.
