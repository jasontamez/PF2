A cluster of quick strikes deals more damage than a single roundhouse swing.

Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike; base attack bonus +6, brawler's flurry class feature, or flurry of blows class feature.

Benefit: When you hit a target with an unarmed strike and you have hit that target with an unarmed strike previously that round, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage to that target.

When you gain the extra damage from this style after hitting a single target with two or more unarmed strikes, you can spend 2 stamina points to increase the extra unarmed strike damage by 1d6 points.
