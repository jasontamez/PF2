Description

This coiled battle horn is crafted from fine brass. When blown, its clarion call can be heard clearly up to a range of 2 miles, cutting through any weather condition short of a windstorm. Once per day, the commander of an army can blow the horn to bolster the troops. This grants the army a +2 bonus on OM checks and Morale checks. The army also gains an additional number of hit points equal to its ACR for that battle.
