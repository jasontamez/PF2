Description

This single-use javelin bears a thunderstone in its haft, just behind the weapon's head. If you hit with one of these javelins, the target takes javelin damage as normal and is the center of the thunderstone's effect. If you miss, roll to see where the javelin lands (as if determining a miss with a splash weapon); that square becomes the center of the thunderstone's effect.
