An arcanist with this exploit can acquire a familiar as the <a href="classdisplay3fa3.html?ItemName=Wizard">arcane bond wizard class feature</a>, using her arcanist level as her wizard level to determine any of the statistics and abilities of the familiar. If the arcanist receives a familiar from another class, her levels of arcanist stack with the levels from that class when determining the familiar's statistics and abilities (this ability does not stack with a familiar gained through the bloodline development exploit; she must choose one or the other).
