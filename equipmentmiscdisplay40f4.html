Description

Sailors, especially on pirate crews, often demand daily rations of alcohol. To prevent hoarding of alcohol (resulting in drunkenness and subsequent hangovers), most captains mix alcohol with water and a bit of lime or lemon juice to make grog. The water dilutes the alcohol and causes it to spoil more quickly, while the citrus juice masks the taste of spoilage and also prevents scurvy.
