Empyreal lords are the greatest members of the agathion, angel, archon, and azata races. All empyreal lords are good outsiders that are, at a minimum, CR 21 (most are at least CR 26 or higher). Empyreal lords have a particular suite of traits (unless otherwise noted in an empyreal lord's entry) as summarized here. <ul><li>Agathion, angel, archon, or azata energy resistances are increased to 30. </li><li>An empyreal lord can grant spells to its worshipers as if it were a deity. An empyreal lord's domains are Chaos (if chaotic), Good, Law (if lawful), and two other domains relevant to its theme and interests (or three other domains if it is neither chaotic nor lawful). Like a deity, an empyreal lord has a favored weapon. </li><li>An empyreal lord's natural weapons and any weapons he or she wields are treated as epic and good for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If the empyreal lord is chaotic or lawful, these weapons also count as having that alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Blindsense 60 feet. </li><li>Greater Teleport (Sp) An empyreal lord can use <a href="spelldisplaydada.html?ItemName=teleport,%20greater">greater teleport</a> as a spell-like ability at will (caster level 20th). </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, charm, compulsion, death effects, energy drain, and petrification. </li><li>Primal Aura (Su) An aura of primeval power surrounds every empyreal lord. The effects of this aura are unique to each empyreal lord. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex) Only mythic damage or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as a deity or demigod) interrupts an empyreal lord's regeneration. </li><li>Seed of Life (Sp) An empyreal lord can touch a willing creature and imbue it with magical healing power. The target radiates an aura of good as if it were an outsider and gains a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against negative energy and death effects. As a standard action, the target can release this energy, turning it inward as a <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> spell targeting itself or outward as <a href="spelldisplay158e.html?ItemName=cure%20serious%20wounds,%20mass">mass cure serious wounds</a> on allies within 30 feet (caster level 15th). If not released, the energy dissipates harmlessly after 24 hours. The empyreal lord can use this ability 5 times per day, but only on other creatures.</li></ul>
