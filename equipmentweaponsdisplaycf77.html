Description

This long-barreled firearm is powered by a removable compressed air reservoir. A misfire while an air repeater has the broken condition does not cause the firearm to explode, but it does destroy the air reservoir. An air repeater can fire 6 shots before the air reservoir is depleted. An air repeater comes with three air reservoirs. Replacing the air reservoir requires 1 minute. The <a href="featdisplay40f9.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Reload">Rapid Reload</a> feat reduces this to a full-round action.
