Description

This potent elixir has the consistency and color of pomegranate juice, and a tart taste with a faint aroma of fresh fruit. Usually found in bamboo containers decorated with images of carp, the sacred animal of the goddess Shizuru, the elixir within contains the distilled spiritual essence of the most honorable guardians who died in service to Minkai's emperors. Each time the character drinking the elixir makes an attack roll, ability check, or skill check, it rolls two d20s and takes the better result, as these spiritual guardians offer their advice and encouragement. This effect lasts for 10 rounds, but it immediately ends if any roll is a natural 20. If the character drinking the elixir is a scion of one of Minkai's five imperial families (including anyone invested as such by an Imperial Seal) and is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points during the duration of the elixir's effects, the elixir also immediately cures the drinker of 5d8+10 points of damage, which can bring a recently slain character back to life. This healing immediately ends any of the elixir's other effects.
