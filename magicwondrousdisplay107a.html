Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This leather cloak looks tattered and stained no matter how carefully it is cleaned and repaired. Once per day, when a ratfolk wearer bleeds upon the cloak (generally when he takes hit point damage), the cloak mentally alerts the wearer's nearest ratfolk ally within 10 miles, telling her the approximate distance and direction to the wearer. It also alerts the wearer to the approximate distance and direction of that ally.
