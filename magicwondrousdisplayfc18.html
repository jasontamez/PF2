Description

These soft leather gloves are constantly encrusted with clay
between the fingers and allow the reshaping of otherwise
durable materials. The wearer can shape objects with hardness
8 or lower (stone, wood, leather, and so on) as if it were soft
clay. While it's possible to rapidly make crude shapes (shaping
roughly 1 cubic foot of material per round), creating fine detail
or moving parts requires additional time and an appropriate
Craft check, at the GM's discretion.


Materials with more than 8 points of hardness are still
affected, though not so dramatically. The wearer may treat
these materials as having half as much hardness when
attempting to damage or reshape them. For instance, a steel
bar normally has 10 points of hardness, but the wearer of the
gloves may treat it as having hardness 5, and shape it with
woodworking tools.


The gloves only affect shaping materials with the wearer's
hands or handheld tools, and only when the wearer desires
to do so.
