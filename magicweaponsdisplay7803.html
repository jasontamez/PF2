Description

Three times per day, the wielder of this +1 pounder tail
attachment can force any creature it strikes to increase in
size by one size category (Fort DC 11 negates) for 3 rounds. An
enlarged creature takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum
of 1), a -1 penalty on attack rolls, and -1 penalty to AC because
of its increased size, as the spell enlarge person. However, an
enlarged creature doesn't gain the usual size bonus to Strength.

If a creature fails its saving throw but can't enlarge any more
because of the environment, it begins squeezing (Pathfinder
RPG Core Rulebook 193). A creature stops growing if growing
larger would make it so large that it would be unable to squeeze.
