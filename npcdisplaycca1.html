Diata the Poacher

Diata specializes in capturing live targets, such as exotic animals or escaped criminals. She doesn't care what she hunts, captures, or kills as long as she's paid on time.

Combat Encounters: Diata may be hired to capture PCs or their animal companions.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Diata avoids dungeons, but can be hired as a scout or sniper in an outdoor fight.
