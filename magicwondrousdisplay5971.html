Description

This tiny, unremarkable silver key can open nearly any set of shackles. When the key is inserted as a standard action into the keyhole of locked leg irons, manacles, or shackles, the lock unlocks provided that its Disable Device DC is 30 or lower. Shackles whose lock has a Disable Device DC of 15 or lower are instantly and silently broken into fragments.

A liberator's key can be used 10 times, after which it crumbles to dust.
