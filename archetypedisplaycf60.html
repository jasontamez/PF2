Aquatic elven adventurers descending into the ruins of sunken Azlant developed techniques to ease their explorations, and they now share these techniques among a loose group of acquaintances calling themselves the seekers of the lost. These aquatic elves eagerly explore trap-laden ruins of all types, using their skills to bypass traps and dispatch animated guardians put in place long ago by the lost cities' original founders. These seekers rarely travel far inland, though they may journey to larger landlocked bodies of water, such as Lake Encarthan, to explore submerged ruins there.

Arcana Breaker (Su): Typically, only magical traps survive for long periods underwater, so a seeker of the lost specializes in noticing and disarming such traps. At 3rd level, a seeker of the lost gains a +1 competence bonus on Perception checks to notice magical traps and on Disable Device checks to disarm magical traps. This bonus increases by an additional +1 every 3 levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of +6 at 18th level).

This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.

Underwater Striker (Ex): At 4th level, a seeker of the lost gains the ability to strike precisely underwater. When a seeker of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon, the damage is not halved for being made underwater, as is usually the case for attacks that deal slashing or bludgeoning damage or, if the rogue is offbalance, attacks that deal piercing damage (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures for more information about being off-balance). In addition, when a seeker of the lost makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon against a construct, she ignores any hardness the construct has.

This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

Wary Disarm (Ex): At 8th level, whenever a seeker of the lost attempts to disarm a trap using Disable Device, she does not spring the trap unless she fails by an amount equal to her rogue level or more. If she does set off a trap she was attempting to disarm, she doubles her trap sense bonus to avoid the trap.

This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

Rogue Talents: The following rogue talents complement the seeker of the lost archetype: canny observer, strong stroke, terrain mastery (water), and trap spotter.

Advanced Talents: The following advanced rogue talents complement the seeker of the lost archetype: defensive roll, dispelling attack, and hide in plain sight (water).
