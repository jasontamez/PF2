Deities: Zon-Kuthon.

Enshrouding Darkness (minor): At 1st level, you can touch an ally and bestow a darkness blessing. For 1 minute, the ally becomes enshrouded in shadows while in combat, granting it concealment (20%). Creatures that are normally able to see in supernatural darkness ignore this concealment.

Darkened Vision (major): At 10th level, you can place a shroud of darkness around the eyes of one foe within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute (as blindness/deafness).
