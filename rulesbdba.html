Get familiar with the scene where the action will occur. If you're running a published adventure, read through it carefully. Not only should you know the answers to basic questions ("How high is the ceiling here"?), but you should also be able to convey sensory details.

Next, take a moment to get familiar with each adventure site's layout. Note the major features and where they lie in relation to each other. Pay special attention to entrances, exits, stairwells, and other features that the characters will use to move around.
