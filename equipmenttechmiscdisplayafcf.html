Description

A veemod ("vision enhancement module") is a narrow crystalline strip that slots into a set of veemod goggles to enhance the goggles' use. Inserting a veemod into a pair of goggles is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Veemods are color-coded items, and provide the following benefits.

Brown Veemod: This veemod darkens the goggles' lenses, providing a +1 circumstance bonus on all saving throws against bright light effects that cause dazzling or blindness. When worn, they also allow creatures impacted by light blindness or light sensitivity to see normally in areas of bright light.

Black Veemod: A black veemod enhances vision, and by blinking twice rapidly, the wearer can magnify what she's seeing. Blinking twice again restores normal vision. This grants a +2 competence bonus on all Perception checks.

White Veemod: This veemod is similar to a black veemod, except that magnification is much stronger, granting a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.

Gray Veemod: This veemod grants low-light vision.

Green Veemod: This veemod magnifies vision even more than a white veemod, granting a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks.

Red Veemod: This veemod grants darkvision to a range of 60 feet.

Blue Veemod: This veemod dramatically extends the scope of peripheral vision, granting the effects of allaround vision-the wearer cannot be flanked.

Orange Veemod: The wearer can see in darkness of any kind, including magical darkness.

Prismatic Veemod: This veemod allows the user to see through solid objects. Vision range is 20 feet, with the wearer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 20 feet of cloth, wood, or similar animal or vegetable material. It can see through up to 10 feet of stone and some metals. It can see through up to 10 inches of iron, steel, copper, brass, or similar metals. It cannot see through lead, gold, platinum, plutonium, or skymetals at all. It's possible to scan an area of up to 100 square feet in 1 round. Secret compartments are 90% likely to be located by x-ray scanning.
