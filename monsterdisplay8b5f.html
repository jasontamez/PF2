Special Abilities

Cloud of Smoke and Fire (Su) As a swift action, a blast shadow can surround itself with a cloud of smoke that burns living flesh. While this ability is active, the blast shadow gains concealment, and all living creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of fire damage per round. If the blast shadow takes any cold damage, this cloud is dispelled and can't be activated again for 1d6 rounds.

Death Burst (Su) When a blast shadow is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it explodes in a blast of flame. All creatures within 30 feet take 5d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Nethys Note: The blast shadow was not given a description. The following is reprinted from its entry in Pathfinder #15: The Armageddon Echo

Death by fire is a horrible fate, but far worse is death by a fiery apocalypse. While most are incinerated by such conflagrations, others are infused with the energy of that terrible act and rise again as blast shadows. These undead creatures linger on after the inferno, seeking to spread their pain to the living. Blast shadows haunt the wastelands that spawned them, waiting for victims to come and learn of the catastrophe. Only then do they strike out from the shadows to show them the horrors up close.

Blast shadows typically have the form of the creatures they were in life, though scorched and withered by their fiery deaths. Little more than humanoid skeletons with bits of flesh and hair fused to charred bones, blast shadows usually weigh little more than 60 pounds, and stand at a height typical for the race of which they were formerly members.

Creating a Blast Shadow

Blast shadows usually spawn as the result of a magical catastrophe, but can also be artificially created. Pyromaniac magic users, worshipers of evil fire deities, and the servants of powers that crave burnt offerings favor these undead horrors. A spellcaster of 14th level or higher can create a blast shadow using create undead. In addition to the normal components of the spell, the spellcaster must use the body of a creature that died as a result of a fire spell or effect. The spell must be one that affects an area. Scorching ray is not sufficient, but fireball is. The creature must have died within 24 hours of the casting of create undead. Blast shadows created in this way are loyal to their creator, but those created by a death burst are beholden to no one.

Variant Blast Shadows

Although most blast shadows are created through fire, others are known to exist. The following variants have different abilities than the standard blast shadow.

Acid Shadow: Created using an acid fog or similar effect, the claws, cloud, and death burst of an acid shadow deal acid damage instead of fire damage. The cloud of an acid shadow does not grant concealment, but any weapon that strikes an acid shadow takes 2d6 points of acid damage.

Freezing Shadow: Those who die from supernatural cold, such as the cold created by control weather, sometimes rise as freezing shadows. The claws, cloud, and death burst of a freezing shadow deal cold damage instead of fire damage. A freezing shadow can move across ice and snow without penalty.

Lightning Shadow: These undead are created through terrible lightning storms, such as those manifested by call lightning storm and storm of vengeance. The claws, cloud, and death burst of a lightning shadow deal electricity damage instead of fire damage. The cloud of a lightning shadow does not grant concealment, but anyone who strikes a lightning shadow with a metal weapon takes 1d6 points of electricity damage.
