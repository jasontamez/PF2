You use your defensive abilities to make overpowering counterattacks.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8f05.html?ItemName=Crane%20Style">Crane Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay2985.html?ItemName=Crane%20Wing">Crane Wing</a>, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8 or monk level 7th.

Benefit:  You take only a -1 penalty on attack rolls for fighting defensively. Whenever you deflect an opponent's attack using Crane Wing or lose the dodge bonus from Crane Wing because an attack missed you by 4 or less, you can make an attack of opportunity against the attacker after the attack misses.
