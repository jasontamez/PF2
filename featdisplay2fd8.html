You have mastered a technique that allows you to release your breath weapon as you bite an opponent.

Prerequisites: Breath weapon, true dragon.

Benefit: You may expend your breath weapon in a continuous way, such that any successful bite attack also deals your breath weapon damage (no save). The slow exhalation of your breath weapon may be maintained for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus if your breath weapon is cone-shaped, or half that duration if it is line-shaped. Once you complete your slow exhalation, you must wait 1d4 rounds as normal before using your breath weapon again.
