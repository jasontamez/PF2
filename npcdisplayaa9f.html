Special Abilities

Auspicious Display (Ex) The prophet gains a +3 dodge bonus to Armor Class (already calculated into her stat block) while wearing at least 9,000 gp worth of jewelry and opulent clothing.

Purchase Spells (Su) The prophet can spontaneously cast a spell even if she has expended all her spells per day by sacrificing currency or gems. This costs 3,000 gp for a 3rdlevel spell, 1,500 gp for a 2nd-level spell, or 500 gp for a 1st-level spell.

Business Acumen (Ex) The prophet treats settlements as two size categories larger when determining their base values and purchase limits.

Mystical Contacts (Ex) Once per week, the prophet can purchase a spellcasting service at half its normal price.

Prophet's Chest (Sp) The prophet can hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane (as secret chest), and can three times per day summon it to the Material Plane as a standard action.

The business acumen of the adherents of the Prophecies of Kalistrade is largely responsible for earning the nation of Druma a place beside the wealthiest nations in the region. Though they bedeck themselves in white robes from head to toe, and live by the strictures of a detailed code of sexual and dietary prohibitions, prophets of Kalistrade are anything but modest when it comes to their wealth. In fact, it is one of their faith's core tenets that a prophet dress opulently as to indicate to all that such wealth comes as a reward for forgoing other of life's indulgences.

Frequently masters of divination and enchantment-which aid them in business dealings ranging from prospecting to negotiation-prophets of Kalistrade generally see magic as a means to an end rather than as a goal to be attained in and of itself. The accumulation of knowledge about magical artifacts, whether of arcane or divine power, is typically valued more in terms of how much such items can be sold for to the right buyer rather than for any scholarly purpose. Prophets take a similar view of just about everything in life, from their political and social alliances to the very jewelry and ornamentation they wear so proudly on their persons. The more value one can amass, the more power one can wield over those who value such splendor.
