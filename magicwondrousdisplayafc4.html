Description

These knee-high black leather boots have prominent and
irregularly shaped heels which seem to bulge from the rest of
the shoe. As a swift action, the boots' wearer can cause the
boots to let loose a spray of caltrops through the back of the
heels as he moves during the remainder of his round. These
caltrops fill each square the wearer moves into during that round.
Any creature, including the wearer, occupying or who steps into
one of these squares suffers the normal effects of coming into
contact with caltrops (Core Rulebook 155). Once produced, these
caltrops remain in existence until removed from their square, at
which point they immediately disappear. The shoes can be used
for 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.
