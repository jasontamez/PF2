Your performance strikes fear in the hearts of foes.

Prerequisites: Ability to start a performance (or raging song) as a move action, bardic performance or raging song- class feature.

Benefit:  When you start a performance (or a raging song) as a move or swift action, you can use a standard action to demoralize a foe (Core Rulebook 99), attempting a Perform check appropriate to your performance in place of the Intimidate check. Your performance must be one with an audible component.

If you can start a performance as a swift action and you have the Dazzling Display feat, you can gain the benefit of Dazzling Display by succeeding at a Perform check in place of an Intimidate check.
