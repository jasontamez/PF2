Mounted Combat (Combat)

You are adept at guiding your mount through combat.

Prerequisites: Ride 1 rank.

Benefit: Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as an immediate action) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll.

Once you have already used this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points to use it an additional time during the same round. You can use this trick as many times in a round as you like, as long as you spend 5 stamina points per use.
