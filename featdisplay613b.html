Although shoreborn see little of their aquatic parents, they can still call on their underwater kin for help.

Prerequisites: Shoreborn half-elf.

Benefit: Once per day, you can fill a vial with water from a natural source and the water will turn magical, functioning as a potion of a 1st-level druid spell of your choice with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice. This potion becomes inert after a number of hours equal to your Hit Dice.
