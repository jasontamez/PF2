Description

This +2 light fortification banded mail
has a small, ovoid stone set in the
left shoulder. The armor monitors the
wearer's hit point total as the spell
status. If an attack against the wearer
does enough damage to kill him
outright, he and his gear are teleported
to a specific location determined at the time of the armor's
creation. This effect acts in all other ways as the spell word of
recall, with the predetermined location considered the place of
sanctuary. The wearer's body is protected from decomposition
for 18 days as per the gentle repose spell. Once this ability
has been used, the stone set into the armor crumbles to dust
and the armor reverts to being a suit of +2 light fortification
banded mail.
