The Usij are a secret cabal of nihilistic spellcasters who follow Ahriman-Lord of All Divs, He Who Walks In Ruin, the Father of Oblivion. Originating in Casmaron, cabals of Usij spread to northern Garund with the Keleshite invasion. In the time since, the cult has flourished in Thuvia, where in the vast deserts of that nation the House of Oblivion stands as a permanent marker of Ahriman's presence. Usij blend in with desert societies, keeping their dedication to their lord a secret while spreading ruin and social decay.

Usij seek to destroy. Some insinuate themselves into high political positions where they steer the might of armies against others, or squander the coffers of wealthy nations and noble houses. Other Usij cabalists spend their efforts to destroy bonds of family, friends, and faith. They maneuver themselves into relationships with troubled people who are easy to sway, and avoid getting their own hands dirty by persuading the desperate to commit ruinous acts. Many Usij are skilled alchemists and entire cells are dedicated to refining deadly poisons and powerful drugs.

These div-callers and agents of catastrophe sometimes gather in secret societies within urban areas or inhabit desert complexes far from scrutiny. Any large cell of Usij is likely to include at least one div that associates with the cell, typically a pairaka or sepid, and many Usij sorcerers and wizards call dorus as familiars. Usij cabals operate independently of each other, but they always pursue the same goal: ruin. Recent rumors claim a cabal of Usij alchemists have joined with a great wyrm blue dragon and are scouring the desert for sun orchids in order to synthesize their own version of the sun orchid elixir. Some say that certain Usij leaders meet annually at a secret location somewhere in central Casmaron, but this may be only whispers on paranoid lips.
