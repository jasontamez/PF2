Description

This delicious-looking gourd is infused with a pungent musk derived from plants gathered in the southern jungles of the Mwangi Expanse. The gourd can be thrown as a splash weapon. Anyone within 10 feet of the point of impact is dazed and blinded by the fumes for 1d4 rounds and forgets the events of the previous round. A successful DC 20 Will saving throw mitigates the effect. Those who succeed at the saving throw are merely dazzled for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. A wielder with the bombs class feature can spend 1 use of that ability to use the ability's DC instead.
