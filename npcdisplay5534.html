The trickster priest serves the goddess of trickery and revenge, using guile and magic to manipulate others.

Unam Clarefield

Unam is affectionate but fickle, philandering but jealous, and inconsiderate but vengeful. To those in his favor, he plays the part of an excellent and dependable ally, but easily turns on those he feels have insulted or jilted him. He is more than willing to influence or control his so-called friends, abandoning them in dangerous situations.

Combat Encounters: With his charm and spells, Unam usually has several followers who are willing to die to prove their affection. He tries to use spells carefully so these "pets" don't come to any harm by his hand.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Unam is eager to avenge old slights or help others in their quests for vengeance, especially if there is an attractive PC he can spend time with.
