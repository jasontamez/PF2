You can verbally bully others into believing unlikely or outrageous lies.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Bluff 1 rank, Intimidate 1 rank.

Benefit: When using Bluff to fool a foe, you can bully that person to reduce the penalty for telling an unlikely or far-fetched lie by 5. If you do so and your check would not have succeeded otherwise, after 1d6??10 minutes, the person you fooled realizes you bullied him into believing a lie, treats you as unfriendly, and might report you or take other actions against you.

Normal: The penalty for telling unlikely lies is -5, and the penalty for telling far-fetched lies is -10.
