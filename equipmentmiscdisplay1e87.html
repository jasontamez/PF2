Description

Harvested from the cytillesh fungus commonly found in the Darklands, these small vials emit a bright blue glow, and are commonly used in intertribal kobold disputes. When broken, a cytillesh stun vial releases a flash of blue light consisting of bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light in a 20-foot radius. All creatures within the flash area must make a Will save (DC 20). Creatures that fail are stunned for 1d2 rounds if they're in the area of bright light, or are confused for 1 round if in the area of dim light. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check.
