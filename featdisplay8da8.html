When you speak to other animals of your kind, you can influence them to act according to your wishes and those of your master.

Prerequisites: Familiar, speak with animals of its kind ability.

Benefit:  Your master gains a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks with animals of your kind. In addition, once per day you can use animal messenger, animal trance, or charm animal as a spell-like ability, using your master's caster level but your own Charisma modifier. These abilities affect only animals of your kind, and you gain only one use of this ability per day (not one of each ability); however, you can gain one additional use of any one of these three abilities by having your master sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot of the same level or higher as a standard action.
