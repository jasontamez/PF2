Description

This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian.
Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane
of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane.
The character creating the item chooses the planes to which the
other five sides are keyed.


If a side of the cubic gate is pressed once, it opens a gate to
a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10%
chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine
randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble.
Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible
to open more than one gate at a time.


If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so
doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along
with all creatures in adjacent squares. The other creatures may
avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves.
