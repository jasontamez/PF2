Like the dragonslayers and giantslayers of legend, you stand alone against creatures far larger than you.

Benefit:  If you are the only character threatening an opponent and you successfully attack the opponent with a two-handed melee weapon, for each size category larger than you that opponent is, you gain a +2 bonus on your melee damage roll.
