As a general rule, each territory should contain at least one location to discover; otherwise there's little point to exploring a territory. In some cases, you need to design only a single location-the focus and eventual goal of the exploration. Other times, such as if the PCs are surveying a lost world or another terra incognita, you'll want to design multiple locations, each competing with the others for the PCs' attention.

Each location should be something memorable and significant. Finding a location should grant a reward (such as a supernatural enhancement, valuable treasure, or a way sign), or that location should be an adventure site. Locations can be as simple as a stash of ancient pirate treasure or as complex as a lost city harboring ancient magic and technological mysteries.

Each location in a territory needs its own discovery score. An obvious location (such as a large castle or a humanoid army camp) should have an initial discovery score of 3, while a more obscure location (such as a single house or a cave entrance) should have an initial discovery score of 6. You can modify this initial discovery score total using the values given on Table 4-2, but feel free to come up with your own values based on the exploration's narrative.



Table 4-2: Discovery Score Modifier

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Condition</td><td>Modifier to Discovery Score</td></tr><tr><td>Desert or plains terrain</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>Forest, hills, or marsh terrain</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Mountain terrain</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>Location is traveled to or from often</td><td>-4</td></tr><tr><td>Location is mobile within the territory</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>Location is unusually large</td><td>-2</td></tr><tr><td>Location is unusually small</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Location is deliberately hidden</td><td>+2 to +6</td></tr> </table> - Adjustments are cumulative, but the minimum discovery score = 1.
