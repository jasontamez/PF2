Disruptive - Feats







Disruptive (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 122</a>
Your training makes it difficult for enemy spellcasters to safely cast spells near you.

Prerequisites: 6th-level fighter.

Benefit: The DC to cast spells defensively increases by +4 for all enemies that are within your threatened area. This increase to casting spells defensively only applies if you are aware of the enemy's location and are capable of taking an attack of opportunity. If you can only take one attack of opportunity per round and have already used that attack, this increase does not apply.

When you use your last attack of opportunity available to you in a round, you can spend 2 stamina points to extend the duration of this feat's increase to DCs for enemies casting defensively within your threatened area until the start of your next turn.

Mythic Disruptive

You're a master at disrupting nearby spellcasters.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay26bb.html?ItemName=Disruptive">Disruptive.</a>

Benefit:  The DC to cast spells defensively within your threatened area increases by half your tier. This stacks with the increase granted by Disruptive. In addition, even if you can't make attacks of opportunity, non-mythic spellcasters are still wary of you and continue to suffer from the effects of Disruptive.
