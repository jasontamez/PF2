A one-shot game is a scenario intended to last for a single play session. These scenarios might be "standalone," with little or no connection to other campaigns you run, or merely a diversion for your regular characters to give you extra time to put together the next major challenge. Paizo's Pathfinder Society Scenarios are designed for just such situations, and can be downloaded from paizo.com. Keep in mind that the characters in these sessions can be the usual PCs, affiliates such as hirelings, or totally new characters intended only for a single game-one-shots are often perfect for unusual character ideas that might fail or grow stale in a longer game.
