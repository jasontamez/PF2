Description

A shadow urn is a simple clay pot that has been imbued with ashes that have passed through the hourglass of shadows. When a shadow urn is broken, the greater shadow that is contained within is released. This shadow is free-willed, but it generally simply attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger for life energy.

Destruction

A shadow urn is consumed when it is used. Each urn contains only one greater shadow. If the urn is broken in an area of full natural sunlight, the shadow within the urn is destroyed instead of being released.
