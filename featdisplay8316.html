Creatures affected by your channel energy are not affected by difficult terrain.

Prerequisites: Animal or Plant domain; channel energy class feature.

Benefit: When you expend one additional use when you channel energy, you enable affected creatures to move freely through undergrowth as per the druid's woodland stride class feature. This effect lasts a for number of minutes equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Multiple uses of this feat extend the duration of the woodland stride effect.
