Description

This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine
magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single
arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the
item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster
and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her
spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells
known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the
spell's cleric or sorcerer/wizard spell level, unless the spell
doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case
it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any
other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level
inquisitor list and the 2nd-level paladin list is priced as a
4th-level spell.
