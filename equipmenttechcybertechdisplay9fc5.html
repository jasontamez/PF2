Description

A cranial bomb is a bomb implanted at the base of the skull that explodes when remotely activated by a detonator's (see page 43) signal. Though normally implanted, a cranial bomb can also be detonated outside of a body. If detonated while implanted, it deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of fire damage, and the recipient must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or be instantly slain. Creatures killed in this manner cannot be revived by breath of life or raise dead. If detonated outside a body, the bomb instead creates a small explosion, dealing the damage detailed above in a 5-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 13 half).
