Description

Named after Sarenrae's herald, Sunlord Thalachos, this +1 flaming holy arrow has a platinum arrowhead and brilliant white fletching. When the arrow successfully strikes an evil-aligned creature, it explodes in a shower of golden sparks that summons a swarm of celestial doves (treat as a celestial bat swarm; Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 294, 30) that continues to attack the arrow's target for 10 rounds or until destroyed or dismissed. If the target is slain before the duration expires, the remaining doves fly off into the horizon.
