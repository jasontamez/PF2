Description

Exquisitely carved from the very finest dark mahogany and polished to a smooth sheen, this 4-inch-long stick feels surprisingly heavy for its size when hefted in the palm. Three notches divide the twig into four 1-inch segments. Snapping the twig at any notch is a swift action that creates smaller twigs of appropriate sizes.

The first caber twigs were created not for combat applications but for performances at tournaments or other festivities. When thrown, a length of caber twig releases a thunderous crack and transforms into a massive log. For every segment of twig used, this log measures 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds. No matter the length, the log created is always 2 feet in diameter. Only one length can be thrown at a time. The dramatic expansion of a caber twig segment proved a popular element of festivals throughout the Abendego coast before the advent of the storm, in much the same way fireworks help accentuate celebrations elsewhere in the world.

The thrower can toss a caber twig at a creature, object, or space within 30 feet. The resulting log always lands upright upon the target. A targeted creature must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or be forced into an adjacent space while taking an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 points per caber twig length used.

Immediately after striking its primary target, the log tilts and crashes down in a direction of the thrower's choosing. All creatures within a straight line that is the length of the log extending from the space of impact must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex saving throw or take 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage.

Once created, a caber twig log is permanent.
