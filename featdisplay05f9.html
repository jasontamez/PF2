You can take advantage of your foes when they overcommit on their attacks.

Prerequisites: Opportune parry and riposte deed.

Benefit:  When your foe is using Power Attack and you successfully use the opportune parry and riposte deed to parry its attack and then respond with a riposte, you add your foe's current bonus on damage rolls from Power Attack to your own damage roll, but you do not take the penalty to hit from your foe's Power Attack.

When you make a riposte using this feat, you can spend up to 5 stamina points to increase the damage of the riposte by double the number of stamina points you spent.
