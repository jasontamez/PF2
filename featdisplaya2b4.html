Your familiar can rework the dream-stuff it is made of.

Prerequisites: Must have a familiar with the figment archetype (see page 10).

Benefit:  Once per day, your familiar can spend a full-round action to manually reshape itself, reassigning 1 evolution point of eidolon evolutions. The evolution it loses can't be a prerequisite for any other evolutions it has. It can use this ability twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 13th level.
