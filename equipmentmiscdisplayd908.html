Description

This gray, greasy topical lotion strengthens and straightens the leg muscles of bandy-legged hobgoblins. Applying loping ointment requires 1 full-round action. A hobgoblin under the effects of loping ointment gains a 10-foot alchemical bonus to his speed when using the charge, run, or withdraw action. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes. Loping ointment is specifically created to enhance hobgoblin physiology; other creatures gain no benefit from this ointment and find it unpleasantly itchy. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
