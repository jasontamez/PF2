Description

The blade of this glaive is serrated and mounted on an axle, around which a heavy cord is wrapped. When the cord is pulled as a move action, the blade spins rapidly for a number of rounds equal to your Strength bonus. While the blade is spinning, you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with the weapon. When the blade is not spinning, treat this weapon as a glaive.
