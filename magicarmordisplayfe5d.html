Description

Armor with this special ability is often engraved or enameled with chaotic religious symbols. Once per day on command, the wearer can invoke an effect as per the spell righteous might, except the wearer gains DR 5/lawful instead of DR/ evil or DR/good. This effect lasts for 10 rounds. Unbound armor bestows one permanent negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wear it. The negative level remains as long as the armor is worn and disappears when it is removed. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the armor is worn.
