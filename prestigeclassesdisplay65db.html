The faithful of Desna are legendary for their love of wayfaring, but the sphere singer takes this wanderlust to almost extreme lengths. Sphere singers combine faith and song to help them in their travels. They are always eager to discover what is past the horizon or in the next chamber. As the sphere singer advances in level, she learns to inf luence dreams and manipulate luck. Eventually, she even transcends her mortal origins to travel among the stars. Yet a sphere singer never loses sight of the fact that no matter how powerful she grows, she is still subject to the fickle whims of fate, and she trusts in luck to aid her in times of need.

The following are the class features of the sphere singer prestige class.

Graceful Hand (Ex): The sphere singer gains Starry Grace as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites.

Starsong (Su): A sphere singer is able to use Perform (sing) to create magical effects, as per the bardic performance bard class feature. She can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to twice her sphere singer level, and can also use rounds of bardic performance gained from bard levels to perform starsong performances, and vice versa. Starting a starsong performance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. If the sphere singer has bardic performance, she can also start bardic performances as a move action instead of a standard action. A starsong performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if the sphere singer is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, silenced, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A starsong performance counts as a bardic performance for the purpose of determining how many performances the sphere singer can have in effect at one time. A starsong performance has audible components but not visual components. At 7th level, a sphere singer can start a starsong performance or a bardic performance as a swift action. The save DC against a sphere singer's performance is equal to 10 + the sphere singer's level + her Charisma modifier.

The sphere singer's performances grow stronger as her level increases.

Wanderer's Hymn: At 1st level, the sphere singer can use music to hasten her steps. As long as she maintains this starsong performance, she gains a +30- foot enhancement bonus to her base land speed.

Sweet Dreams: At 3rd level, the sphere singer can spend 5 minutes performing and expend 5 rounds of starsong to protect sleepers. Any creature that remains within 30 feet of the sphere singer during the entire 5 minute performances becomes immune to nightmare and other effects that attack a sleeping target, such as a night hag's dream haunting ability, for one night's rest. In addition, those creatures gain the benefits of dream feast (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 232).

Butterfly: At 5th level, the sphere singer's music lets her explore the skies. While she maintains this starsong, she gains the benefits of fly. Alternately, by spending 5 minutes performing and expending 10 rounds of starsong performance, she can gain the benefits of overland flight. Both of these effects manifest at a caster level equal to the sphere singer's total Hit Dice. While under either effect, the sphere singer grows large butterfly wings.

Guide My Steps: At 7th level, the sphere singer learns to use song as a guide to her goal. To use this starsong, she must spend 3 rounds performing and expend 6 rounds of starsong performance. At the end of this performance, the sphere singer gains the benefits of find the path at a caster level equal to her character level.

If the sphere singer chooses, she can perform guide my steps without a clear destination in mind. At the GM's discretion, the sphere singer may be guided to something particularly interesting, such as a new romantic opportunity, a good place to watch the sunset, or an exotic monster's den; otherwise, she merely wanders aimlessly until the effects end.

Fortune's Favor: At 9th level, the sphere singer's song is so lively and delightful that Desna herself takes notice, blessing her with peerless luck. While she maintains this starsong, whenever the sphere singer rolls a d20 (but no more often than once per round), she can roll twice and take the more favorable result.

Versatile Performance (Ex): At 2nd and 6th levels, the sphere singer gains versatile performance, as per the bard class feature. The sphere singer can choose only Perform (sing) or Perform (dance); once she has already chosen both of these, she can instead gain any other versatile performance. When the sphere singer gains this ability, she can retrain ranks in the associated skills at no cost.

Wandering Dream (Su): At 4th level, the sphere singer gains Lucid Dreamer as a bonus feat. Each night as she sleeps, she can contact a single person. This functions as dream, except that the sphere singer must be very familiar with the recipient. Many sphere singers keep contact with distant family or lovers this way. At 6th level, this effect allows the recipient to enter the sphere singer's dreamscape, as per dream council (as if the recipient had cast dream in response).

At 8th level, instead of contacting a familiar person, the sphere singer can travel to a creature's dream and leave a suggestion. This functions as demand, but modifying dream instead of sending. When used this way, the normal restrictions on dream's recipient apply. The sphere singer chooses which of these abilities to use (if any) when she goes to sleep.

Tapestry Traveler (Ex, Sp): At 10th level, the sphere singer transcends mortality like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, her essence infused with stardust and unearthly energies. Her type changes to fey, and she grows large butterfly wings, gaining a fly speed of 50 feet (good). In addition, she becomes immune to cold and gains the no breath universal monster ability.
