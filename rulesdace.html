These options primarily factor into interactions other than combat. Most of them are good for creating adversaries who present a noncombat challenge or for quickly generating NPC allies with useful abilities.

Alertness: When attempting a Perception or Sense Motive check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Animal Talker: The monster can speak with animals, and gains Handle Animal as an additional master skill.

Knowledgeable: When attempting any Knowledge check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Liar: When attempting a Bluff, Disguise, or Stealth skill check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result. The monster's lies can't be detected by magic unless the one attempting to detect them succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 15 + the monster's CR).

Linguist: The monster speaks, reads, and understands all languages.

Mercantile Savvy: When attempting an Appraise check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result. In addition, the monster can attempt to identify magic items without casting <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a>, using Appraise instead of Spellcraft. If the monster fails, it can't attempt to identify the same item again.

Persuasive: When attempting a Charisma-based skill check, the monster rolls twice and takes the higher result.

Slippery Mind: If the monster would be affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails its saving throw, it can repeat the saving throw attempt 1 round later.

Sound Mimicry: The monster can perfectly mimic sounds, and possibly voices. It gains Bluff as an additional master skill, and can attempt a Bluff check opposed by its targets' Sense Motive checks to mimic a sound convincingly. The target takes a -8 penalty if it's unfamiliar with the type of sound or creature being imitated.

Telepathy: The monster can mentally communicate with any creature within 100 feet that has a language.
