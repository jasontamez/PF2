The false medium is a master of pretending to have occult powers in order to manipulate the emotions and atmosphere of the people and places around him, often reaping a healthy reward from the bereaved, who find solace in his comforting lies.

Dim the Lights (Ex):  At 1st level, while in dim light or darkness, a false medium adds 1/2 his rogue level as a bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks, and creatures without low-light vision or darkvision take an equal penalty on skill checks to oppose the false medium's Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.

False Sensitivity (Ex):  At 2nd level, a charlatan can convincingly fake the ability to use occult skill unlocks such as automatic writing and dowsing. An untrained onlooker can't tell the difference between the false medium's scams and a true use of occult skill unlocks. An onlooker capable of using the particular occult skill unlock that the false medium is faking can attempt the appropriate skill check for that unlock, opposed by the false medium's Bluff check, to detect the fraud. In any case, any results of the false medium's charades are fabricated (for instance, the false medium might ask leading questions to elicit false memories while pretending to use hypnotism). This ability replaces the 2nd-level rogue talent.

Haunting Presences (Ex):  At 3rd level, the false medium exploits his natural talent for deception to convince others of the presence of false supernatural entities. As long as the false medium is in conditions of dim light or darkness, he can use Bluff skill checks to emulate the effects of dancing lights, ghost sound, silent image, or ventriloquism by throwing his voice, subtly misdirecting or convincing subjects, or manipulating light and shadows. The range of these effects is 10 feet from the false medium, plus an additional 5 feet for every 3 rogue levels he possesses beyond 3rd. The effects last for 1 round, though they can be maintained with additional checks. Only one of these effects can be created or maintained in a given round. Observers can attempt either a Perception or Sense Motive check (whichever of their bonuses is higher) to oppose this Bluff check; the GM should roll these checks secretly. This is an extraordinary ability and not an illusion, so if the false medium succeeds at the opposed check, even powerful effects like true seeing don't detect the fakery.

This ability replaces trap sense.
