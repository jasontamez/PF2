Description

These pouchlike boots come in sets of four, and can be placed on an animal's paws and fastened with a drawstring. The soles are sewn with treated leather shaped like human footprints that allow the wearer to leave human tracks. A successful DC 20 Survival or Knowledge (nature) check allows an individual to recognize the tracks as fake but gives no clue as to the identity of the real perpetrator.
