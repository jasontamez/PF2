The animal's grace and agility are honed for battle, making it a deadly combatant.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay0fde.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Finesse">Weapon Finesse</a>, base attack bonus +3, animal companion.

Benefit: Choose one of the animal companion's natural attack. When the animal companion makes a melee attack with the chosen natural attack using its Dexterity bonus on attack rolls and its Strength bonus on damage rolls, it adds 1/4 of its Hit Dice as a bonus on damage rolls. This bonus damage doesn't increase or decrease based upon whether the natural attack is a primary or secondary natural attack.

Special: You can select this feat multiple times. Its effects don't stack. Each time you select this feat, choose a different natural attack to apply its benefit to.
