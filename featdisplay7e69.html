You can quickly recover from your lunges, helping you to avoid counterattacks.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayd4fd.html?ItemName=Lunge">Lunge</a>, Acrobatics 1 rank.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can use the Lunge feat to increase the reach of your melee attacks by 5 feet until the end of your turn, without suffering a penalty to your AC. You cannot use this feat if you carry a medium or heavy load.

Normal: You take a -2 penalty to your AC until your next turn when making a lunge attack.
