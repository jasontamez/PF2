Description

This heavy iron arrowhead is sealed with an alchemical resin. Pulling a small string (a move action) breaks the seal and triggers a reaction in the arrowhead, greatly increasing its magnetic properties. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls when firing a lodestone arrow at a target wearing metal armor or a target made of metal, but the magnetized arrow deals only half damage on a successful hit. The increased magnetism fades 1 round after you activate a lodestone arrow, after which it becomes a normal arrow.
