Not all constructs are built with the <a href="featdisplay2071.html?ItemName=Craft%20Construct">Craft Construct</a> feat. Spells like <a href="spelldisplay72da.html?ItemName=animate%20objects">animate objects</a> allow a caster to temporarily animate an existing object. These constructs are in many ways weaker than manufactured constructs, as they are susceptible to dispelling and antimagic.

A caster can use the <a href="spelldisplay72da.html?ItemName=animate%20objects">animate objects</a> spell to instantly create a temporary construct. A <a href="spelldisplaycf5a.html?ItemName=permanency">permanency</a> spell cast upon an animated object makes the construct permanent; however, it can still be dispelled or suppressed by antimagic. Craft Construct creates permanent animated objects not susceptible to dispelling and antimagic. The CR of a potential animated object depends on its size and abilities, as explained in the <a href="monsterdisplayff66.html?ItemName=Animated%20Object">animated object monster entry</a>.
