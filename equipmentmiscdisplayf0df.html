Description

These Tiny animals eat smaller animals and can be found in nearly any environment. They are clever and curious, traits that are magnified when they are kept as familiars. Many varieties of weasel exude a strong musky odor. This description also applies to similar animals, such as ferrets, minks, polecats, and stoats. More information on weasels can be found in the Bestiary.
