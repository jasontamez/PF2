If the settlement's nature is contrary to the kind of building or organization you're trying to construct or create (such as a Black Market or Thieves' Guild in a settlement with low Crime and high Law settlement modifiers), the GM might decide that construction or recruitment takes 1d6 ?? 10% longer than normal (minimum 1 extra day) if you aren't monitoring the work.

You can shorten this extra time before or during the delay by spending 1 point of Influence, which reduces the additional time by 1d6 days (minimum 0 days of delay). You can instead have a cohort monitor the work, or hire a <a href="rules6366.html?Name=Managers&amp;Category=Downtime">competent employee</a> to do so; either of these options completely prevents the delay.
