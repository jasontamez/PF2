Your heavenly light can be used in a variety of ways.

Prerequisites: Aasimar, daylight spell-like ability, sufficiently high level (see below).

Benefit:  You gain one additional use per day of daylight. Choose one spell from the table below; by expending a use of daylight, you may use this spell as a spell-like ability. To select a spell, you must meet the minimum character level for its listing in the table. The save DC for this spell is Charisma-based.
