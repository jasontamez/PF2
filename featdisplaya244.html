Those distracted by your performance leave themselves open to vicious attacks.

Prerequisites: Cha 15; <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>; <a href="featdisplay7b69.html?ItemName=Diva%20Style">Diva Style</a>; <a href="featdisplayed67.html?ItemName=Improved%20Feint">Improved Feint</a>; base attack bonus +7 or bard level 7th.

Benefit: While using Diva Style, the first time you hit with a melee weapon in a round, you deal an additional amount of damage equal to your Charisma modifier to a target that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This damage is precision-based, and is not multiplied on a critical hit.
