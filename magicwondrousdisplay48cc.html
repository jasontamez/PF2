Description

A common accoutrement often crafted by worshipers of Hei Feng, these magical tassels are usually affixed to the pommels of bladed weapons, though they can be fastened to other weapons as well. The tassel has no effect unless attached to a weapon, and even then, it activates only under certain conditions.

The wielder gains a +4 circumstance bonus on performance combat checks (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 153). When the wielder takes a standard action to fight defensively, the next attack that misses her before the start of her next round causes the attacker to take 3d6 points of electricity damage. Once the electricity is discharged, the crackling tassel can't be used again for 24 hours.
