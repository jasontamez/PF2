Description

A slender copper band, a tyrant's friend is thin enough to be hidden beneath another ring (although it still counts against the limit of magic rings a character can wear). The ring grows noticeably warmer whenever the hand wearing it touches a poisoned or poisonous object or creature (including containers holding poison), warning the wearer of potential danger.
