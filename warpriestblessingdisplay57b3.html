Deities: Iomedae, Sarenrae.

Blinding Strike (minor): At 1st level, you can create a flash of sunlight in the eyes of one of your opponents. The target is blinded for 1 round. If it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw, it's instead dazzled for 1 round. Creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity take a -4 penalty on this saving throw. This is a light effect. Sightless creatures are unaffected by this ability.

Cleansing Fire (major): At 10th level, you can touch a weapon and grant it either the flaming or undead-bane weapon special ability for 1 minute. If you spend two uses of your blessing when activating this ability, the weapon can have both weapon special abilities.
