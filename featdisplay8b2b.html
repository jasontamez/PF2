When you infuse your weapon with arcane might, your attacks make foes more susceptible to magic.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a>, ability to cast arcane spells.

Benefit:  If you have a weapon that is augmented by your Arcane Strike feat, when you damage a creature with an attack made with that weapon, that creature takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities. This effect lasts for 1 round.
