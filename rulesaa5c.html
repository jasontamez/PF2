Spells that protect against or repel all sorts of wilderness threats appear in this range.

<a href="spelldisplayf044.html?ItemName=Antilife%20Shell">Antilife Shell</a> and <a href="spelldisplay76ac.html?ItemName=Antiplant%20Shell">Antiplant Shell</a>: These are notable defensive spells because they don't allow a saving throw to resist their effects. While spell resistance offers a means of defense against these spells, such an ability is almost nonexistent among plant creatures. Despite the lengthy 1-round casting time, successfully casting <a href="spelldisplayb913.html?ItemName=antilife%20shell">antilife shell</a> can buy precious rounds of protection to cast other spells. <a href="spelldisplay2d00.html?ItemName=Antiplant%20shell">Antiplant shell</a> has a shorter casting time and a lower spell level, making it more useful when dealing with plant threats.

Repel Vermin: <a href="spelldisplay3c34.html?ItemName=Repel%20vermin">Repel vermin</a> is similar to <a href="spelldisplayb913.html?ItemName=antilife%20shell">antilife shell</a>, but it takes up a lower-level spell slot and requires less time to cast. While the field created by this spell can be bypassed with a successful Will save, it still deals damage to vermin managing to traverse it-a particularly powerful effect against large numbers of enemies with few hit points. Perhaps the most enticing use of <a href="spelldisplay6857.html?ItemName=repel%20vermin">repel vermin</a> is its ability to diminish the effectiveness of vermin swarms.
