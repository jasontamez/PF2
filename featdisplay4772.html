You have a large wingspan for a member of your race, and can use these appendages to batter your foes.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Fly)</a>, base attack bonus +8.

Benefit:  You gain two wing attacks. These are secondary natural attacks that each deal damage appropriate to a creature one size category larger than yourself (see page 302 of the Bestiary). You are also considered one size category larger for the purposes of any feats or abilities related to your wings, such as the Hover feat.

Special: While the following feats are primarily taken by strix, other creatures with natural wings can also take them at the GM's discretion.
