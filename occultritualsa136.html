Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The ritual allows the primary caster to tap into the multiversal connection shared by all <a href="monsterfamiliesc452.html?ItemName=Aeon">aeons</a>. The primary caster weaves complicated occult patterns around herself with the silver wire; if secondary casters are involved in the ritual, they stand around the primary caster and the primary caster wraps the silver wire around their outstretched limbs to form these patterns. If successfully performed, the primary caster can utilize the envisaging ability as though she were an aeon to communicate with other creatures, can attempt Knowledge checks untrained, and gains an enhancement bonus on Knowledge checks equal to half her character level or twice the number of secondary casters, whichever is greater. Although the primary caster can communicate with aeons themselves across vast gulfs of distance and even planar boundaries, they are unlikely to respond except to profess amusement or mild annoyance.
