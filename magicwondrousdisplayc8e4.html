The random snippets of script that
write across the surface of this
parchment-colored eyeless mask hint
at the knowledge of the many tomes
stored within. The mask grants its

Knowledge skill checks, but the wearer
is blinded while wearing the mask. The mask must be worn for
10 minutes before the wearer gains its bonus.
