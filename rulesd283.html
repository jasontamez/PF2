Forests and jungles are, in the broadest possible terms, places where a significant number of trees grow and where a wide variety of other plants and animals live and thrive. The type of forest changes by latitude and terrain, ranging from sparse evergreens and other conifers in the coldest and highest parts of the world to dense, broadleaf jungle in the tropics. The strength of a forest's canopy should be determined-if the canopy creates too much shadow on the ground below, it can prevent the growth of underbrush. Leafier and more mature trees cast greater shadows, and thus more of the forest's inhabitants may live in the trees.

The following sections of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook can help flesh out forest or jungle terrain. <a href="rules2ed3.html?Name=Forest%20Terrain&amp;Category=Wilderness">Forest terrain is described here</a>, but when adventuring in the forest or jungle, some possible encounters might also incorporate darkness, falling branches or trees, fog, forest fires and smoke, or swampy terrain. In addition, trees and undergrowth can provide cover and concealment.
