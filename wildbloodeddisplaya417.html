The universe punishes those who interfere with destiny.

Associated Bloodline: Destined.

Bloodline Arcana: If you are casting defensively because a creature is threatening you and you fail your concentration check, one of the creatures that is threatening you provokes an attack of opportunity from you or from one ally who is adjacent to the enemy. You decide which creature provokes this attack and which of its adjacent opponents may make the attack.

Bloodline Powers: Your blood responds angrily when you are attacked.

Fate's Retribution (Su): Starting at 1st level, when you are hit by a melee attack, as an immediate action, you can curse the creature that struck you. The target takes a -2 penalty on all attack and damage rolls for 1d4 rounds. A Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This bloodline power replaces touch of destiny.
