Focusing Blow (Teamwork)

You and your allies work together to shake off mental effects.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayaeef.html?ItemName=Hobgoblin%20Discipline">Hobgoblin Discipline</a>, hobgoblin.

Benefit:  An ally who also has this feat can deal damage to you in order to break an ongoing mind-affecting effect that allows a saving throw. The ally must cause at least 5 points of damage to you with an attack, spell, or other ability. You then reroll your saving throw, with a +1 bonus for every 5 additional points of damage the attack caused. If your save is successful, the mind-affecting effect ends. Only damage actually dealt counts for purposes of this feat; nonlethal damage and damage reduced or eliminated by damage reduction, resistances, and so on does not qualify.
