Description

This leather-bound book looks like a journal partially ruined by moisture. The pages that are still legible detail three violent events that apparently took place while the writer was traveling through an unknown land. There are several varieties of the book, each describing a perilous journey through a different terrain type corresponding to the encounter tables on page 324 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.

Reading any of the three accounts triggers the curse, after which the reader is compelled to protect the book at all costs and secretly read the other two accounts over the next 2 days. Each day the owner reads one of the accounts, monsters of a type appropriate to the book's terrain attack during the night. Determine the specific monsters by rolling on the appropriate encounter tables. If the prevailing weather is vastly different from typical weather in the climate described in the journal, a sudden change in weather usually heralds the arrival of the monsters (as per control weather).

Once the three attacks are over, the book mysteriously vanishes, lifting the curse. The book reappears later, however, at a random location.
