Description

When tossed into the air, this tarnished copper coin brings forth
potential lost by life's decisions. If a human, half-elf, or half-orc
flips the coin and catches it, she takes a -2 penalty to the ability
score modified by her +2 racial ability score bonus, but gains a
+2 inherent bonus to a random other ability score. The bonus
and penalty last for 1 hour. Negating the penalty automatically
negates the bonus as well. The coin can be used three times per
day.
