All creatures that ride as a part of the wild hunt are chaotic neutral fey that have the following abilities (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Immunity to cold. </li><li>Resistance to electricity and fire 10. </li><li>Enhanced Senses (Ex): All members of the wild hunt have greensight 60 feet, scent, and see in darkness. </li><li>Instinctive Cooperation (Ex): Creatures with the wild hunt subtype are immune to all supernatural abilities of other creatures with the wild hunt subtype that allow a saving throw (such as wild gaze). </li><li>Planar Acclimation (Ex): A creature with the wild hunt subtype is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype. </li><li>Speak with Nature (Sp): Wild hunt creatures have <a href="spelldisplayf324.html?ItemName=know%20direction">know direction</a>, <a href="spelldisplay8821.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20animals">speak with animals</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay3ee7.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20plants">speak with plants</a> as constant spell-like abilities, and can cast <a href="spelldisplayea0c.html?ItemName=stone%20tell">stone tell</a> as a spell-like ability 3 times per day. </li><li>Wild Gaze (Su): All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save against the gaze of a member of the wild hunt instinctively recognize their power. Humanoids and monstrous humanoids stand frozen in awe, becoming paralyzed. Magical beasts and animals become frightened, and all other creatures become confused. These effects last for 1 round, and multiple failed saving throws against multiple members of the wild hunt in a single round do not cause this duration to stack. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this special attack is immune to the wild gaze from any member of the wild hunt for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </li><li>Wild Grace (Su): Wild hunt creatures add their Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to their AC. </li><li>Wild Hunt Link (Su): Members of the wild hunt can communicate telepathically across great distances and share abilities with each other. As long as a member of the hunt is not more than 500 feet away from the nearest other member of its hunt, it can participate in the wild hunt link. Each wild hunt creature shares a different set of abilities with other creatures in the link. A lone member of the wild hunt does not gain the benefit of any abilities it grants via its wild hunt link, and identical abilities granted by multiple wild hunt fey do not stack.</li></ul>
