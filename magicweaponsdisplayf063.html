Description

These +1 gauntlets are made of snakeskin and grant a +1 enhancement bonus on grapple checks.

Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of a pair of constrictor's gauntlets can target a single creature wearing medium or heavy armor within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw or its armor shrinks and constricts, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to the target if it's wearing medium armor or 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage if it's wearing heavy armor. The armor deals this damage each round for 3 rounds, and then returns to its normal size. The armor's armor bonus, maximum Dexterity bonus, armor check penalty, and other attributes do not change while it is shrunken.
