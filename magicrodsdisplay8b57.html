Description

This curved, snake-headed scepter is cool and moist to the touch. When you hold the rod aloft and speak the command word, tiny blue-tinged vipers pour out of your eyes, ears, and mouth until you collapse and vanish into a writhing mass of intertwined snakes. Treat this effect as the polymorph spell, but use the stats for a centipede swarm, MM 238, except that the swarm is considered to have a hive mind. The disturbing transformation can be performed once per day and lasts up to 10 minutes or until you discontinue it (as a free action).

Requirements Craft Rod, polymorph, summon swarm; Cost 5,000 gp, 400 XP
