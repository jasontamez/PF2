Using a mix of rousing oratory, song, and thunderous spells, a sound warrior is often heard before she's seen.

Rindra Thunderpath

Rindra always loved loud noises and the jolt of surprise they caused to those around her. She sought out ways to make more and bigger noises, and eventually turned to magic so she could call down cacophonous thunder anytime she wanted to. She prefers the sounds of storms and beasts over those of the cities, so she lives out in the wild.

Combat Encounters: Rindra protects many canyons and mountain passes, and loves how the noises from her thunderous spells bounce off the stone walls.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Rindra speaks loudly and forcefully, often stomping her feet for emphasis or letting out a surprisingly powerful belly laugh.
