All bugbears smell fear, but some sense it far more keenly than others. These bugbears gain advantages against most foes and prove particularly dangerous against those whose spirits are curdled by terror.

Prerequisites: Possess the scent ability, any evil.

Benefit: You can track by smell and automatically pinpoint the location of opponents by scent alone if they are within 30 feet. In addition, you gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against shaken or frightened opponents, and you can detect them at twice the normal scent range (120 feet, pinpoint at 60 feet). You gain a +2 bonus on all Will saves as long as a shaken or frightened target is in range. You cannot be surprised by anyone who is shaken or frightened within range of your enhanced sense of smell.
