Description

This fist-sized statue of a curled-up cat is crafted from gleaming moonstone. When the statue is placed upon the chest of a helpless creature, it briefly animates and stretches like a real cat waking up from a fitful sleep, then curls up again. When this happens, the helpless creature is lulled into a deep sleep, and doesn't awaken until the cat is removed from its chest.

If the creature placing the cat expends three uses of mythic power while doing so, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a week, even if the cat is removed. If the user instead expends six uses of mythic power, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a month. If the user expends 10 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a year. If the user expends 20 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for an entire century.

While in this sleep, the helpless creature's heart rate and breathing slow to a barely perceptible rate. It doesn't need to eat or drink, though it must still breathe and it ages normally while in this magical sleep. A wish, miracle, or mythic break enchantment can end this magical sleep.
