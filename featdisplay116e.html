Your dual heritage makes you something more than merely a mix of your parent races.

Prerequisites: Two subtypes, elf blood or orc blood racial trait.

Benefit:  For the purposes of any effect related to subtype (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), you count as neither of your subtypes, and you no longer count as either of your parent races for the purposes of effects related to race.
