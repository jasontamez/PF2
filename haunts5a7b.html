Effect Hundreds of razor-sharp knives appear and carve into the skin of those in the haunt's area. An affected creature can attempt a DC 25 Fortitude save to maintain the connection between its skin and its body. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 points of slashing damage. Creatures that fail this saving throw take 20d6 points of slashing damage as they are flayed alive. The skin of each flayed creature animates into a necromantic puppet that single-mindedly tries to kill its source. The skin carries all of the creature's equipment (and thus the creature loses access to this equipment), has access to all of its abilities, and shares its statistics, except its hit point total is equal to half the original creature's maximum hit points. If the skin uses one of the creature's limited-use abilities, it counts against the creature's total uses for the day. A flayed creature is permanently sickened, and is staggered from the pain unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn. Even if she defeats her necrotic skin, a flayed creature's skin never regrows naturally, and can only be restored with <a href="spelldisplayb175.html?ItemName=regenerate">regenerate</a>.
Destruction A flayed herald of a deity must be reunited with its skin and cured of its madness to give the haunt its final rest. If a character manages this feat, all flayed suicide haunts in existence on any plane are instantly destroyed.


Description

A flayed suicide haunt arises from the spirits of people tortured beyond insanity, until no remnants of their former essence remain. Only kytons are capable of the depths of depravity required to produce this powerful, disturbing vestige of suffering.
