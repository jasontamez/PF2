Description

These talismans are 6-inch-long strips of paper bearing mystic words of sealing written in traditional calligraphy. Hailing from the province of Tianjing, they are one of several methods the aasimars of that land have kept qlippoth invaders from entering the Material Plane, and the government of Tianjing pays a high price for them. If an ofuda of dimensional warding is placed on a prominent structure (such as a large tree, a statue, or a gate), and a special 24-hour ritual is performed, it creates a dimensional lock effect in a 240-foot-radius area which lasts until the ofuda of dimensional warding is removed. Any effect that moves the object that the ofuda of dimensional warding is attached to ends the effect until the ritual is performed again.
