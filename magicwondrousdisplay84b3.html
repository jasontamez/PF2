Description

Merlokrep's crown is as old as his tribe, and the burnished bronze heirloom has passed from king to king for centuries. The blood rite mumbled by Jekkajak might or might not exist, but even without this ceremony the crown invests its wearer with power. Wearing the crown grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma and a +2 natural armor bonus. You are immune to the frightful presence ability of all dragons. If you are a sorcerer you cast spells at +1 caster level.
