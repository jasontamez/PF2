Description

Cotraveling armor is decorated with the embroidered image of a five-armed spiral. While the armor is worn, the wearer can touch a willing creature and attune that creature to one of the five arms; once an arm is attuned, it glows faintly with what appears to be starlight. Once per day as a free action (even if it is not the wearer's turn) when the wearer is sent to another plane by a spell or effect, he can activate the armor to allow all creatures attuned to it to accompany him, provided the attuned creature is within 30 feet. If an attuned creature is willing, it travels along with the character, arriving with that character on the destination plane at the same relative distance from the wearer as when the wearer used this ability (or as close to it as possible, given the nature of the new plane). Once used, all five arms of the spiral deactivate, even if not all of the attuned characters were willing or able to accompany the traveler to the new destination, and the wearer must wait 24 hours before attuning new creatures to the spiral.
