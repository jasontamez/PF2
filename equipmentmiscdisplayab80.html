Description

Comprising several chunks of magnetized ore connected by twine, a clatterstone creates an intense racket when it strikes a solid surface. The combination of magnetic disturbances, noise, and vibrations interferes with blindsight. A creature using blindsight perceives a detonated clatterstone as a Medium target until it attempts to interact with the perceived "creature" or identifies it with some other sense, such as darkvision. You can throw a clatterstone as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet, and it remains active for 1d4+1 rounds before becoming inert.
