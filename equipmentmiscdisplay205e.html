Description

This device is a sharp, double-ended prong that is approximately 9 inches in length and fitted with a stout leather neckband. This nefarious device is secured on a helpless target's neck so the prongs pierce both the underside of the victim's chin and the victim's chest, dealing 1d6 points of nonlethal damage when the device is attached and an additional 1d6 points of nonlethal damage if the victim begins to fall asleep, effectively keeping the victim awake indefinitely and subjecting the victim to fatigue and exhaustion through sleep deprivation. A successful DC 22 Escape Artist check allows the victim to get free of the prongs without using his arms, though the heretic's fork remains strapped to his neck.
