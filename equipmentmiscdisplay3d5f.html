Description

This 2-foot-tall, vase-shaped object is inspired by the huge warka towers found in inland areas of Senghor and other parts of the Mwangi Expanse. The warka jar is made of lightweight and elastic juncus stalks woven into a crisscross pattern. A fine mesh hangs inside and collects water condensation. Placing a warka jar outside overnight collects enough fresh water for a single creature to survive for one day. When not in use, the warka jar can be collapsed into a pocket-sized cube for easy transportation.
