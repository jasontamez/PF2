Through violent and torturous conditioning, you have built up a resistance to pain.

Prerequisites: Survived being tortured 10 or more times.

Benefit: If you take nonlethal damage, you may attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC equal to 10 + the nonlethal damage dealt) to reduce that damage by half. The Endurance feat grants a +4 bonus on this saving throw.
