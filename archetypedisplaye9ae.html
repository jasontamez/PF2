When the dwarves began their Quest for Sky millennia ago to reach the world's surface, they already had a deep understanding of the earth's secrets. In the centuries since, the mystic lore the dwarves call earthcraft has been passed down through the generations, and its practitioners are called earthshadows. While many earthshadows are dwarves, their secrets have been shared with a worthy few members of other races over the ages.

Earthlink (Su): The earth grants an earthshadow swiftness and hones her senses. When an earthshadow is in direct contact with an expanse of natural earth or unworked stone that is at least as large as she is, she adds half her rogue level (minimum 1) to Acrobatics and Perception checks.

This replaces trapfinding.

Earthcraft (Su): At 2nd level, an earthshadow can draw upon the power of earth to perform mystical tricks. At the start of each day, an earthshadow gains a pool of earthcraft points equal to half her rogue level plus her Wisdom modifier, and she can spend earthcraft points to use certain spell-like abilities. The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the earthshadow's rogue level. Earthcraft effects affect only the earthshadow, even if the spell could normally affect others. She can spend 1 earthcraft point to cast blend (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide 29), even if she is not an elf, but this ability works only in areas of natural earth or unworked stone.

At 4th level, an earthshadow can spend 2 earthcraft points to cast meld into stone.

At 8th level, an earthshadow can spend 3 earthcraft points to cast dimension door. She must be able to see her destination (or she must be able to otherwise sense its surface, such as with tremorsense), and her current location must be connected to her destination by continuous natural earth or unworked stone.

At 12th level, an earthshadow can spend 5 earthcraft points to cast the spell stone tell but can communicate only with unworked stone.

At 16th level, an earthshadow can spend 6 earthcraft points to cast statue.

This ability replaces evasion and the rogue talents gained at 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th levels.
