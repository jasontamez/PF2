Description

The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This +3 greatsword appears to be roughly forged and has scrawls of Hallit engraved about the hilt. The wielder gains extra power against arcane spellcasters, such as witches. The blade counts as a bane weapon against any creature that has the ability to cast arcane spells (spell-like abilities don't count, but a dragon's ability to cast as a sorcerer does, for example).
