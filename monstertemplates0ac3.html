A creature with the colour-blighted simple template appears hideously deformed and glows with the same unnamable color as the creature that blighted it. A colour-blighted creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: A colour-blighted creature's ability scores are already drained as a result of being fed upon by a <a href="monsterdisplay286b.html?ItemName=Colour%20Out%20of%20Space">colour out of space</a>, but once a creature gains this template it becomes immune to further feed attacks from colours out of space until it loses the colour-blighted simple template. A Charisma score drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack is raised to 1; otherwise, its ability scores are not altered by this template. In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one only has to restore all of its drained ability scores to normal. As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets. Every 24 hours, a creature suffering from this simple template must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or crumble into fine, white ash'such a doom means instant death and, for many color-blighted creatures, the only chance at escape from a life filled with pain.
