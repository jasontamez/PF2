Your ties to nature have more to do with creatures than with capriciousness.

Associated Bloodline: Fey.

Bloodline Arcana: See bloodline powers.

Bloodline Powers: Your magic shows a kinship to that of the beast-talkers and shapechanger fey.

Animal Companion (Ex): You gain an animal companion. Your effective druid level for this ability is equal to your sorcerer level - 3 (minimum 1st). This bloodline power counts as your bloodline arcana and also replaces laughing touch.

Fey Wings (Su): At 15th level, you can grow insectlike wings from your back and become one size category smaller (as if you had used reduce person), gaining a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. You can maintain this form for 1 minute per level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. This bloodline power replaces fey magic.
