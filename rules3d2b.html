Healthy-Weakened-Impaired-Animalistic-Comatose-Dead



Weakened: A character whose reason is weakened by Intelligence poison takes a -2 penalty on all Intelligencebased skill checks and ability checks. A character with spellcasting based on Intelligence decreases his DCs by 2 and can no longer cast his highest level of spells.

Impaired: A character impaired by Intelligence poison does not add his Intelligence bonus to the number of uses per day of pools and abilities (such as an arcane pool) and does not gain bonus spells per day from his Intelligence. He takes an additional -2 penalty on the above Intelligence-based rolls. An Intelligence-based caster reduces his DCs by an additional 2, and he can no longer cast his 2 highest levels of spells.

Animalistic: A character rendered animalistic by Intelligence poison suffers the same effects as from a <a href="spelldisplay7e0b.html?ItemName=feeblemind">feeblemind</a> spell, except his Charisma and Charisma-based skills are unaffected.

Comatose: A character rendered comatose by Intelligence poison is no longer able to process thoughts. He cannot be woken by any means as long as he remains in this state.

Dead: The character's brain stops functioning, and he dies.
