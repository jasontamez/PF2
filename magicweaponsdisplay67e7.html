Description

This steel tankard functions as a +1 light hammer. Worshipers of Cayden Cailean are automatically proficient with it. The interior of the tankard contains six identical extradimensional spaces. Each space can hold 1 dose of a different potable liquid of up to 1/2 cubic foot in volume (including potions, but not poisons). Liquid never sloshes out of the these spaces accidentally (though it often appears ready to do so), and when the wielder drinks from the tankard, it provides the drink from the desired extradimensional pocket (or a random pocket, if the wielder has no preference).
