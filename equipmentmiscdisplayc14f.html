Description

This simply carved but sturdy 3-footlong wooden cane is used to scrutinize plague victims. The wand permits the plague doctor to determine a patient's condition, diagnosing his maladies through his reactions to various pokes and prods, often opening infected sores and wounds for inspection. These tools have the same statistics as clubs.
