Description

This elixir is normally made from the juice of tomb herald brambles, though other formulae have also been discovered. It allows creatures with the scent ability to smell fear, and instills a bloodlust in the imbiber when it's facing a fearful creature. The imbiber gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks made with the scent ability, and a successful DC 15 Perception check allows the imbiber to determine by scent whether a creature is shaken, frightened, or panicked. Once a creature's condition has been identified, the imbiber gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and opposed skill checks against that opponent.

These effects last for 1d4+1 hours. If a creature drinks a second elixir of oppression within 24 hours of the first, it is sickened for 24 hours and does not gain the benefits of the second dose.
