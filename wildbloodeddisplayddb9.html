Your powers rise like the tides.

Associated Bloodline: Aquatic.

Bloodline Arcana: When you are in a body of water large enough to float in, your effective caster level is increased by 1.

Bloodline Powers: You prefer to attack with water rather than to leech it away.

Water Blast (Sp): As a standard action, you can fire a bolt of water at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The foe is knocked prone, and at your option may be pushed 5 feet directly away from you. A reflex save (DC 10 +1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. This bloodline power replaces dehydrating touch.
