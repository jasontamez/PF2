Description

A book of this sort looks like a normal volume on some mildly
interesting topic. Any character who opens the work and reads
so much as a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will
saves. The first is to determine if the reader takes 1 point of
permanent Intelligence and Charisma drain. The second is to
find out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom
drain. To destroy the book, it must be burned while remove
curse is being cast. If the grimoire is placed with other books,
its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those
other works.
