Tatterlorn - Monsters







Tatterlorn

This deathly figure is draped with filthy rags. Its thin, gray arms end in ruinous claws, and its movements are weirdly difficult to follow with the eye.

Special Abilities

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid that dies while under the effects of isolate (see below) rises as a tatterlorn in 1d4 rounds.

Forsaken (Su) Living creatures have difficulty noticing or even gazing directly at a tatterlorn. Against living observers, a tatterlorn gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and always has concealment (20% miss chance). A tatterlorn's attacks of opportunity against any creature affected by this defense always resolve as if the target were flat-footed. <a href="spelldisplay256c.html?ItemName=True%20seeing">True seeing</a> negates this ability. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Isolate (Su) As a swift action, a tatterlorn can isolate a living creature from the world. The target must be within 10 feet of the tatterlorn, and can resist being isolated with a successful DC 20 Will save. Regardless of the saving throw, a single creature can only be targeted by this effect once every 24 hours. Isolation persists for 1 minute, during which time the isolated creature treats all other creatures as if they had the tatterlorn's forsaken ability, and all living creatures treat the isolated character in the same manner. An isolated creature cannot take the aid another action, nor can it benefit from this action. Worse, an isolated creature becomes nearly overwhelmed with sensations of loneliness and neglect, and becomes increasingly convinced it is without purpose in the world. This causes a creature to take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and Will saving throws. This effect of isolate is a mind-affecting effect, but all other effects are not. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Tatterlorns spawn as a result of slow, preventable deaths witnessed by multiple indifferent onlookers. Given these circumstances, tatterlorns are most often found in large cities, especially in nations such as Cheliax, Katapesh, or Nidal. In these places, the urban poor can succumb to starvation or exposure on the street while passersby pretend not to notice. As they were ignored and invisible in life, so they are in death. The eyes of living creatures subconsciously refuse to linger on a tatterlorn, making direct observation almost impossible. This is not true invisibility, however, and a tatterlorn can be seen in peripheral vision.

Filled with rage at their unnecessary deaths and at the callousness of the living, tatterlorns stalk the areas where they died, looking for lone victims. They rarely kill in combat, preferring to subdue victims and keep them somewhere to watch them starve or succumb to the elements. When faced with multiple dangerous opponents, tatterlorns prefer to use their isolate ability on physically weak enemies before employing hit-and-run tactics.

Most disturbing of all are the unexpected relationships that form when tatterlorns encounter attic whisperers. Seeing <a href="monsterdisplay81ca.html?ItemName=Attic%20Whisperer">attic whisperers</a> as kindred spirits, tatterlorns sometimes create unholy families with these undead children, sharing lairs in abandoned buildings or sewers. A tatterlorn multiplies through the abduction of children, whom it transforms into attic whisperers to assuage its unending loneliness, often causing mass hysteria in cities as children go missing. Tatterlorns heading larger families sometimes advance by taking class levels in rogue, becoming devastating combatants.
