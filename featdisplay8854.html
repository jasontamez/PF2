Maximized Spellstrike

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 109</a>
You deal brutal damage against opponents caught unawares.

Prerequisites: Maximized magic magus arcana, weapon expertise class feature or Quick Draw.

Benefit:  When you make a melee attack and successfully use your spellstrike ability against an opponent denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, you can spend 3 points from your arcane pool to maximize the spell delivered through your spellstrike as if using the Maximize Spell metamagic feat.
