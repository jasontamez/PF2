Abomination

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 64</a>
Your mind is impure, tainted by outside forces. These might be monstrous ancestors whose blood still flows within you, or powerful and unknowable psychic forces that intrude upon your mind. Like a psychic disease, this influence consumes part of your brain, creating a dark counterpart to your normal self. Every time you call forth a psychic spell, you're drawing on this dangerous force-and potentially giving it a greater hold on you. This malign influence might stem from creatures like rakshasas and aboleths, or perhaps malign entities that dwell in the voids between the stars.

Discipline Powers: Your powers allow the dark influences to take over, and it can be difficult to come back from the brink.

Dark Half (Su): By allowing the dark forces to overcome you, you can enter a state of instinctual cruelty as a swift action. While you're manifesting your dark half, you increase the DCs of your psychic spells by 1, gain a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and become immune to fear effects. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage while manifesting your dark half, you can cause one creature that took damage from the spell to also take 1 point of bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage increases to 2 points at 5th level and to 1d6 points at 13th level. While manifesting your dark half, you can't use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, and Ride) or any ability that requires patience or concentration other than casting spells using psychic magic, using phrenic amplifications, or attempting to return to normal. You can attempt to return to your normal self as a free action, but must succeed at a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + your caster level. If you fail, you continue to manifest your dark half and can't attempt to change back for 1 round. You can manifest your dark half for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + 1/2 your psychic level + your Charisma modifier; when these rounds are expended, you return to your normal self without requiring a concentration check.

Morphic Form (Ex): At 5th level, while manifesting your dark half, you gain DR 5. This damage reduction can be overcome by a random type of damage each time you manifest your dark half, determined by rolling on the table below.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>d%</td><td>Damage Reduction</td></tr> <tr><td>1-35</td><td>DR 5/bludgeoning</td></tr> <tr><td>36-60</td><td>DR 5/cold iron</td></tr> <tr><td>61-100</td><td>DR 5/magic</td></tr></table>

Psychic Safeguard (Su): At 13th level, you project constant mental defenses, gaining spell resistance equal to 8 + your caster level. While manifesting your dark half, this spell resistance increases to 16 + your caster level.
