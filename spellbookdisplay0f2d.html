The steel cover of this slim journal has taken its fair share of abuse; acid scars and minor slag spots show where the journal was subjected to intense working conditions. Equations, balances, and chemical notations mark the margins of the pages-with some formulae, it is difficult to tell where the notes end and the formula begins.
Value 395 gp (770 gp with the preparation ritual)
