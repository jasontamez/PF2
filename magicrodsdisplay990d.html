Description

This lengthy rod looks like a walking cane with a stylized crystal skull at its top. As a standard action up to three times per day, the wielder can slam the base of the rod into the ground while designating a target within 60 feet. Grasping hands of ectoplasm manifest from the ground surrounding the target in a 5-foot radius. Creatures within the radius must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or they are entangled by the grasping hands and unable to move more than 10 feet from the affected area (as if snared by a net with a trailing rope). Creatures moving through the ectoplasm must also succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled. As a standard action, a creature entangled by the ectoplasm can attempt an additional DC 14 Reflex save to attempt to escape and end the effect. The summoned ectoplasm lasts for 10 rounds before disappearing.
