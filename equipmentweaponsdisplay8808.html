Description

Brutal hooks and barbs are worked along the weapon's blade or length. Only piercing or slashing weapons can have jagged hooks. Projectile weapons can't have jagged hooks, but their ammunition can. A weapon with jagged hooks deals additional damage equal to the weapon's critical hit multiplier on a confirmed critical hit; this additional damage is added to the final total, and is not multiplied by the critical hit multiplier.
