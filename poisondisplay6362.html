Description

Blackfingers's salt can easily be hidden in all foods and beverages, as it lacks color, odor, and, despite the name, flavor. Soon after consuming this dastardly poison, a creature develops painful, bleeding ulcers throughout its stomach and esophagus. Followers of Norgorber originally developed the salt to mimic targets suffering a medical emergency and thus avoid suspicion of poisoning.
