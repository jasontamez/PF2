Description

These palm-sized silver dragon scales are unique items-essentially minor artifacts resulting from Terendelev's death on the Storm King's blade.

Each of Terendelev's scales grants a different power to the person who carries them. The powers granted do not function at all if more than one scale is carried. The powers of the four scales are listed below-any nonevil creature that handles a scale immediately understands its use.

Cloudwalking: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast levitate. A pillar of roiling clouds rises below the levitating object or creature, growing and shrinking with the target's altitude. This pillar is 5 feet in diameter (regardless of the target's size) and provides concealment (20% miss chance) to any creature or object wholly contained within.

Disguise: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast alter self. While disguised, the target gains a +4 bonus on all Bluff checks made against evil creatures.

Resistance: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast resist elements-but only against electricity or cold.

Sacred Weaponry: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast align weapon, but only to make a weapon lawful or good. Unlike a normal align weapon spell, this effect can be cast on an unarmed strike or natural weapon.

Destruction

The Storm King Khorramzadeh can destroy each of Terendelev's scales merely by eating it.
