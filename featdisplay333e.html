Your intensive combat training to fight vampiric forces allows you to fight off their mental spells and effects using your resistance to fear.

Prerequisites: Bravery class feature.

Benefit:  You add your bravery bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting spells and effects from vampires. This does not stack with the normal bravery bonus on saves against fear effects.
