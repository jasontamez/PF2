Description

Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance. A royal outfit is rarely designed for regular wear or inclement weather-or even for donning unaided-as it's presumed that anyone who might be wearing it has plenty of servants to take care of his or her every need. This outfit includes only the clothing, not a royal scepter, crown, ring, or other regal accoutrements.
