You can change the nature of your toxic spittle to put your enemies to sleep.

Prerequisites: Vishkanya.

Benefit:  As a swift action, you may alter the effects of your venom so the target falls unconscious. This changes the initial and secondary effect of your venom to the following: initial effect staggered for 1d4 rounds; secondary effect unconsciousness for 1 minute. You must make the decision to alter your venom before you apply it to a weapon.

Normal:  Vishkanya venom deals Dexterity damage.
