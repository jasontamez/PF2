Description

Also known as lodestone essence, this coarse gray powder
comes in a fragile ceramic flask covered in Terran runes.
A newly-crafted flask contains enough powder for 10
applications if poured out carefully, or the whole container
can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment
of 10 feet.


One application of the dust sprinkled over an object
increases the target's weight by 100 pounds. Multiple
applications stack, and the effect remains until the object is
scrubbed clean of the metallic particles (taking a full-round
action per application) or it takes 5 points of electricity
damage per application.


A creature struck directly with a thrown flask must make
a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per application remaining in
the flask) or gain heavy encumbrance and be unable to
fly for 2d4 rounds. Targets in the splash area must save
or gain medium encumbrance for 2d4 rounds. Scrubbing
or electricity damage neutralizes the thrown powder as
noted above.
