Description

Sounding a horn requires a DC 10 Perform (wind instruments) check and can convey concepts such as "Attack!", "Help!", "Advance!", "Retreat!", "Fire!", and "Alarm!" The report of a signal horn can be clearly heard (Perception DC 0) up to a half-mile distant. For each quarter-mile beyond, Perception checks to hear the horn take a -1 penalty.
