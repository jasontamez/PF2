Description

A corrosive burst weapon functions as a corrosive weapon that explodes with searing acid upon striking a successful critical hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra acid damage from the corrosive special ability, a corrosive burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of acid damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical modifier is 3, add an extra 2d10 points of acid damage instead, and if the modifier is 4, add an extra 3d10 points.

Even if the corrosive ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra acid damage on a successful critical hit.
