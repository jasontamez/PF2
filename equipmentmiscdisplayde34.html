Description

A smoke bomb appears as a polished ceramic sphere that can be held comfortably in one hand. Many crafters of these alchemical weapons take pride in painting or etching these bombs with complex scenes, or even making them look like small humanoid skulls, despite the fact that the bombs shatter when thrown. When thrown as a splash weapon, a smoke bomb bursts and fills the 5-foot square it detonates in with a cloud of thick, foul-smelling gray smoke (treat this area as if affected by a <a href="spelldisplayb85f.html?ItemName=fog%20cloud">fog cloud</a> spell, except that the cloud lasts only 1 round before dissipating). A creature that is struck by a smoke bomb or that passes through the cloud a bomb creates must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 3 rounds after that. Creatures within 5 feet of where the flask hits are sickened for 1 round if they fail this saving throw. This is a poison effect. Crafting a smoke bomb requires a successful DC 22 Craft (alchemy) check.
