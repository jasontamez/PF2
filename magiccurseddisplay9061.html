Description

This vicious-looking +2 battleaxe grants its wielder the Great
Cleave feat. But when using this feat, the wielder makes an
additional attack against a random adjacent creature instead
of choosing which creature to attack. When determining which
creature is attacked, the wielder always counts himself as a
possible target, even if he is not adjacent to the target. The
wielder of a biting battleaxe must always uses it as his primary
weapon and must use Great Cleave at every opportunity until
subject to a remove curse spell or similar effect.
