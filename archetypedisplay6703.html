Scourges are students of pain and have a rare connection to tormented and wracked spirits. Most are worshipers of Zon-Kuthon who are more attracted to his mastery of pain than his lordship over darkness. As a result, scourges are found not only in Nidal, but also in Cheliax, Geb, and Irrisen. Faithful of the Midnight Lord often claim the spirits bound to scourges are tortured souls who begged to be given some boon by their deity, and that having their torment extend into death is a reward, rather than a punishment. Scourges seek to share their phantoms' miseries with all around them, using the spirit's pain as a weapon. A scourge's phantom is a broken and wretched creature, and the torments it suffered in life are ref lected in its ghostly or ectoplasmic appearance as wounds, scars, grotesque malformations, and tattered garments.


Spell Scourge (Su): At 4th level, when a scourge's phantom damages a creature, it causes severe pain, requiring that creature to succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + spell level) to use spells, spell-like abilities, and other abilities that require concentration for 1 round.  The phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls when making attacks of opportunity. Any creature threatened by the scourge's phantom takes a -2 penalty on concentration checks.

his ability replaces spiritual interference.


Endure Torment (Ex): At 6th level, a scourge's phantom gains immunity to pain effects and gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against effects that could cause it to become staggered or stunned.

This ability replaces devotion.


Inflict Pain (Sp): At 7th level, a scourge can use inflict pain as a spell-like ability once per day, plus one additional use per day for every 4 spiritualist levels beyond 7th. If her phantom is fully manifested, it can also use this ability, though doing so takes the phantom a full-round action, and it still counts against the scourge's daily uses of this ability.

This ability replaces calm spirit.


Ectoplasmic Swarm (Su): At 12th level, as a standard action, a scourge with a phantom manifested in ectoplasmic form can command it to break apart in a gruesome display of gore and agony, transforming it into a swarm of Diminutive ectoplasmic organs and viscera. The phantom gains the swarm subtype, dealing its unmodified slam damage die as damage for its swarm attack. Its distraction DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier. In this form, the phantom is too diffuse to use inflict pain or any of its abilities from emotional focus (even passive abilities).

This ability replaces greater spiritual interference.
