Master Siege Engineer (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 109</a>
You are significantly faster at loading a siege engine, as well as a better shot.

Prerequisites: Siege Weapon Engineer, Knowledge (engineering) 10 ranks.

Benefit:  If you are the crew lead on a siege engine, your crew can use move actions to load a siege engine. When you spend actions to aim a siege engine, you and your crew can use move actions instead of full-round actions to aim the siege engine (page 160).

Normal:  Full-round actions are required to load and aim siege engines.

You can spend 5 stamina points to reduce the number of actions it takes to aim and load a siege engine by one for 1 round (minimum one action). You must be the crew lead of that siege engine.
