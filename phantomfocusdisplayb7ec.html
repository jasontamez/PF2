Phantoms with this focus stand on trembling legs, with hands quivering and tears constantly streaming from their eyes. Their auras are typically a blue or purple, but the phantoms have vividly glowing scars and bruises that pulse and throb with their motion. When addressed, they tend to respond with only slight nods and other subtle gestures, rarely speaking beyond soft-spoken apologies and self-recriminations.

While clearly in a state of constant pain, they show no concern for their own well-being, focusing entirely on protecting their masters and their masters' allies. Each time one of these phantoms uses its abilities to protect its allies from harm, new injuries manifest visibly upon it, which these phantoms wear like badges of honor.

Skills: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Climb and Heal equal to its number of Hit Dice. When confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

Good Saves: Fortitude and Will.

Endurance: The phantom gains Endurance as a bonus feat. Furthermore, when the phantom is confined in its master's consciousness, it grants the benefits of Endurance to its master if its master doesn't have that feat.

Repelling Strike (Ex): When the phantom deals damage with a melee attack, it can attempt to bull rush the target as a swift action without provoking attacks of opportunity, using the result of its attack roll for the combat maneuver check. The phantom can push a creature back only 5 feet with this ability, regardless of the result of its combat maneuver check.

Numbing Aura (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-foot aura of protection. Allies within this aura gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against curse, disease, evil, fear, pain, and poison effects (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 137-138). Deactivating the aura is a free action. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

Suffer in Stead (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, as an immediate action when her phantom is fully manifested and within 30 feet of her, she can transfer any of the following conditions to the phantom that would afflict her: blinded, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, paralyzed, sickened, staggered, or stunned. The spiritualist must choose to do this before the condition's duration begins. The spiritualist can't use this ability if any of the listed conditions are already affecting the phantom. Using this ability does not affect the duration of the transferred condition; it simply makes the condition affect the phantom instead of the spiritualist.

When the spiritualist reaches 18th level, as an immediate action when fully manifested, the phantom can use this ability to transfer any of the listed conditions to itself when the condition would afflict any ally within 30 feet. Using the ability in this way requires no additional action from the spiritualist.

Willing Martyr (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom begins to anticipate when the spiritualist or her allies would fall into grave bodily danger and can take those wounds itself. Whenever the phantom is fully manifested and the spiritualist or an ally is reduced to one-quarter or fewer hit points, as long as the phantom is within 30 feet, it must take any hit point damage or ability score damage in place of the injured spiritualist or ally. This hit point damage or ability score damage bypasses the phantom's defensive abilities (although it is still subject to the defensive abilities of the originally targeted spiritualist or ally) and afflicts the phantom as it would the spiritualist or ally. After the phantom becomes the target of one attack or effect in place of the injured spiritualist or ally, the spiritualist can command the phantom to suppress this ability as a free action. Reactivating this ability is a swift action.
