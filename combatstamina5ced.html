Choose a second 1st-level swashbuckler deed. You can spend panache to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of panache. If you gain levels in a class that grants the panache class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of panache when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the Extra Panache feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat).
