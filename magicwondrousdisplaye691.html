Description

In addition to hiding the face, this fine lace veil protects the
wearer against gaze attacks. The wearer has a 50% chance
to avoid making a saving throw against a gaze attack even
when not averting her eyes. If the wearer averts her eyes,
she rolls twice (once for the veil, once for averting her eyes)
and uses the more favorable result.


Against patterns, visual figments, and other vision-based
effects and attacks that cannot affect blind creatures, the veil
grants the wearer a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws.
The veil does not otherwise impede the wearer's vision in
any way.
