Description

This simple, hollow tube roughly as long as the user's forearm is typically made to resemble a specific type of aquatic foliage, so that its user remains inconspicuous while underwater. Using a breathing tube, an air-breathing creature can stay fully submerged under water indefinitely, as long as it remains near enough to the surface of the water for the tube to reach the air.
