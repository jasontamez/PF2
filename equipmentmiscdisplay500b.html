Description

This heavy cloth is dyed to match a single terrain type (chosen from the ranger's list of favored terrains). This canvas can be stretched over an area to obfuscate it from creatures wandering by. Creatures unaware of the setup must succeed at a DC 14 Perception check to realize the covered area is actually a canvas sheet. A camouflaged canvas is not waterproof, but it can be treated with oil, resin, or wax to make it water resistant.

Price and weight are for 1 square yard of canvas.
