Curses can have a wide range of effects, which is something to keep in mind when designing a new curse. They may trigger only intermittently, apply a constant penalty, or grow worse with time. In addition, curses can function exclusively using game mechanics, or incorporate roleplaying considerations.

Intermittent: Some curses, such as <a href="curses7303.html?ItemName=Unluck">unluck</a>, trigger only under certain conditions but otherwise stay consistent in their effects.

Mechanical: These curses rely on game mechanics for the majority of their effects, such as applying penalties, ability damage, or negative conditions. This sort of curse is a good choice if you want a steady, consistent effect for the curse, though particularly with conditions, you might have to start considering interactions with other abilities triggered by those conditions.

Progressive: A progressive curse functions much like a disease, requiring periodic checks to determine whether the affliction progresses. However, unlike those suffering from diseases, the victims of these curses cannot recover just by succeeding at saving throws. A progressive curse worsens with each failed save, often ending in incapacitation or death. <a href="curses0cea.html?ItemName=Mummy%20Rot">Mummy rot</a> is a typical progressive curse.

Static: Curses like <a href="cursesedf1.html?ItemName=Baleful%20Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a> apply an effect for the entire duration of the curse, with no change in their severity.
