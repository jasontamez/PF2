Nature Spirit

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy978v?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Class-Guide">Advanced Class Guide pg. 44</a>
A shaman who selects the nature spirit takes on an appearance that reflects the aspect of the natural world she has the closest connection to. A nature shaman from the forest has a green tinge to her skin and hair, with eyes of sparkling emerald and the scent of green leaves and flowers about her. A nature shaman from the tundra is typically alabaster pale, with platinum hair and crystal blue eyes, and her skin always seems strangely cold.

Hexes: A shaman who chooses the Nature spirit can select from the following hexes.

Entangling Curse (Su): The shaman entangles a creature within 30 feet for a number of rounds equal to the shaman's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). A successful Reflex saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Erosion Curse (Su): The shaman summons the powers of nature to erode a construct or object within 30 feet. This erosion deals 1d6 points of damage per 2 shaman levels, ignoring hardness and damage reduction. If used against a construct or an object in another creature's possession, the construct or the creature possessing the object can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. Once an object or a construct is damaged by this erosion, it cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

Friend to Animals (Su): The shaman can spontaneously cast summon nature's ally spells as a druid. In addition, all animals within 30 feet of the shaman receive a sacred bonus on all saving throws equal to the shaman's Charisma modifier.

Speak with Animals (Ex): Choose a specific kind of animal: eagle, fox, dog, and so on. The shaman gains the ability to converse with that type of animal as if she were under the effects of speak with animal. The shaman gains the ability to communicate with an additional kind of animal for every 3 shaman levels she possesses (two animals at 3rd level, three at 6th, up to a maximum of seven at 18th level).

Stormwalker (Su): The shaman can move through nonmagical fog, rain, mist, snow, and other environmental effects without penalty (see Weather, Core Rulebook 437). She is never slowed by such effects, and she doesn't need to attempt Acrobatics skill checks to move across such surfaces. She can also move through magical environmental effects that she created. At 10th level, the shaman can see twice as far as normal through environmental effects, whether or not they are magical in nature.

Spirit Animal: The shaman's spirit animal looks feral, and appears to be in peak physical form. The animal can move through any sort of undergrowth or natural difficult terrain at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. If the animal has a fly speed, it can ignore the penalty on Fly skill checks for winds up to windstorm strength (see page 439 of the Core Rulebook).

Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Nature spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.

Storm Burst (Su): As a standard action, the shaman causes a small storm of swirling wind and rain to form around one creature within 30 feet. This storm causes the target to treat all foes as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance for 1 round plus 1 round for every 4 shaman levels she possesses. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon she wields is treated as a thundering weapon.

Greater Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Nature spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.

Spirit of Nature (Su): Whenever the shaman is reduced to below 0 hit points, she automatically stabilizes and gains fast healing 1 for 1d4 rounds. At 15th level, this increases to fast healing 3.

True Spirit Ability: A shaman who chooses the Nature spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.

Companion Animal (Su): The shaman's spirit animal takes the form of an animal companion (Core Rulebook 51) of her choice, using her shaman level as her effective druid level. The animal retains all the special abilities and the Intelligence score of the spirit animal, but also has the statistics and abilities of an animal companion. If the animal is dismissed, is lost, or dies, it can be replaced in the same way as a normal spirit animal.

Manifestation: Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of nature. Once per day, she can surround herself with an organic cocoon of silk as a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, she's considered helpless. Eight hours later, she emerges, having changed her type to plant, animal, or humanoid, and having gained superficial physical characteristics of the chosen type as appropriate (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). She must choose a type that is different from her current type. This effect change doesn't alter her Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill ranks, class skills, or prof iciencies. The effect is permanent, until the shaman chooses to transform again. Each time the transformation is made, the shaman is cleansed of all poisons or diseases, restored to full hit points, and healed of all ability damage.
