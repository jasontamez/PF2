When you're in the company of other aliens, your thoughts become difficult to follow.

Prerequisites: Android, kasatha, lashunta, or Triaxian.

Benefit:  Whenever you're adjacent to at least one other android, kasatha, lashunta, or Triaxian ally who also has this feat, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects and divination (scrying) effects, unless the effect comes from an android, kasatha, lashunta, or Triaxian.
