Description

With a monocle of flawlessness placed over her eye, an artist or artisan is able to achieve consistent excellence, as its faceted lenses magnify and reveal imperfections that she can correct. The wearer of a monocle of flawlessness gains a +5 competence bonus on checks with any Craft skill in which she is trained. The wearer can also create masterwork components in half the normal amount of time (when crafting an item, only the time to craft the masterwork component of the item is halved). The monocle's wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus on Linguistics checks to spot forgeries and Perception checks to see through disguises. The monocle further grants its wearer a +2 competence bonus on saving throws to disbelieve illusions, due to her sublime attention to detail.
