The following triggers allow a character participating in a performance combat to make a performance combat check as a swift action. A character can always opt not to make a performance combat check that requires a swift action. Some feats, called performance feats, allow a character to perform other actions as part of the performance combat check.

Charge: Whenever a combatant hits with a charge attack, she can make a performance combat check as a swift action.

Combat Maneuvers: Whenever a combatant successfully performs any combat maneuver, she can make a performance combat check as a swift action.

Dealing Maximum Damage: Whenever a combatant deals maximum damage with a damage roll (weapon or spell, but not including sneak attack or other variable precision damage), she can make a performance combat check as a swift action. She gains a penalty or bonus on this check based on the type of weapon or spell she uses. Light weapons take a -4 penalty on the check, one-handed weapons grant neither a bonus or a penalty, and two-handed or exotic weapons grant a +2 circumstance bonus on the check. Spells grant a bonus on the performance combat check equal to half their spell level.

Energy Spells and Effects: Crowds tend to respond to flashy spells and effects. If a combatant casts a spell or produces an effect that deals acid, cold, fire, electricity, force, or sonic damage in a visible way (including weapons with special abilities like <a href="magicweaponsdisplay24ed.html?ItemName=Flaming%20Burst">flaming burst</a> or <a href="magicweaponsdisplay4179.html?ItemName=Shocking%20Burst">shocking burst</a> that deal bursts of energy damage on critical hits), she can make a performance combat check as a swift action.

Feint: If a combatant successfully feints against an enemy, she can make a performance combat check as a swift action.

Knocking Opponent Prone: When a combatant knocks another combatant prone, she can make a performance combat check as a swift action.

Multiple Hits: If a combatant has more than one attack on her turn and hits an opponent with at least two of those attacks, she can make a performance combat check as a swift action. She gains a +2 bonus on this performance combat check for every attack she hits with beyond the second.
