Baku Dreamweaver

Simple but elegant robes drape over this gray-furred, trunked quadruped, and its kind gaze suggests a gentle wisdom.

Special Abilities

Consume Dream (Su) A baku dreamweaver can consume the dreams of any sleeping creature within 100 feet, either preventing nightmares or causing fatigue and preventing all effects of rest, as per a normal baku's dream eating ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 31). When it is within the Dimension of Dreams, it can use this ability on a creature whose lucid body is within 100 feet to cause that creature to instantly leave the Dimension of Dreams (removing its lucid body), with no saving throw.

Dream Shepherd (Su) A dreamweaver can enter the Dimension of Dreams at any time and herd a dreamer across the dreamscape, traveling great distances in a short period, as per the dream travel spell. When the dreamweaver uses either this ability or its dream voyage psychic magic ability, reaching a destination dream takes 30 minutes instead of 1 hour for a creature on the same plane, and the baku dreamweaver gains a +5 bonus on any required Will saves.

Dream Whispers (Su) A dreamweaver can manipulate the dreams of nearby creatures to cultivate particular dreams. When it encounters a dreaming creature, a dreamweaver can change that creature's dreamscape in any way that the greater create mindscape spell can shape a mindscape. The dreamscape acts as an immersive and harmless mindscape, taking any form the baku dreamweaver desires.

Dreaming Grace (Su) A baku dreamweaver has devoured so many insubstantial dreams and dream creatures that it gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier and adds half its Charisma modifier to its Constitution modifier to determine its hit points and its bonuses on Fortitude saves and Constitution checks.

Mental Siphon (Su) When a dreamweaver hits with a claw attack, it also deals 1d4 points of ability damage to a mental ability score of the dreamweaver's choice. A successful DC 24 Will save negates this ability damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Oneiromancy (Su) While within the Dimension of Dreams, a dreamweaver can predict that plane's strange dream logic, allowing it to reroll a single failed attack roll or saving throw once per round.

Description

Unlike normal bakus, who contentedly feed on any dreams, dreamweavers savor the dreams of only the most imaginative and creative beings, particularly those of people who are attuned to the spiritual realms or possess psychic abilities. The potency of such sleepers' dreams grants dreamweavers increased power. Dreamweavers still despise night hags and other nightmare creatures, and use their puissant abilities to destroy these menaces.
