Description

A splendorous ring is composed of six white and yellow
gemstones faceted in a platinum band. Three times per day,
the wearer of a splendorous ring can twist the ring to cloak
himself in an aura of glory. He appears both radiant and terrible,
glowing with the might of the heavens. Anyone within 10 feet
of the ring when it is activated must succeed at a DC 13 Will
save or be fascinated by the wearer's form as if affected by
hypnotic pattern. 2d4+3 Hit Dice worth of creatures are affected
in this way.

The fascinating effect of the ring lasts for 3 rounds. During
that time and for 5 rounds after, the ring's wearer gains a +2
sacred bonus on any Charisma checks or Charisma-based skill
checks to influence any good-aligned creatures affected by the
ring's hypnotic pattern effect, and a -2 penalty on any Charisma
checks or Charisma-based skill checks to influence any evilaligned
creatures affected by the hypnotic pattern effect.
