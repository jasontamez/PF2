You can shift and change a binary mindscape to your advantage during a psychic duel.

Prerequisites: Int 13, ability to cast instigate psychic duel.

Benefit:  When you cast instigate psychic duel and create a binary mindscape (see page 235), the arena you create puts your enemy at a disadvantage. Your opponent must spend 1 more manifestation point than normal when creating any defensive manifestations.
