Conjuration School

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 80</a>
The conjurer focuses on the study of summoning monsters and magic alike to bend to his will.

Summoner's Charm (Su): Whenever you cast a conjuration (summoning) spell, increase the duration by a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). At 20th level, you can change the duration of all summon monster spells to permanent. You can have no more than one summon monster spell made permanent in this way at one time. If you designate another summon monster spell as permanent, the previous spell immediately ends. This increase is not doubled by Extend Spell.

Acid Dart (Sp): As a standard action you can unleash an acid dart targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acid dart deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two wizard levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. This attack ignores spell resistance.

Dimensional Steps (Sp): At 8th level, you can use this ability to teleport up to 30 feet per wizard level per day as a standard action. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments and such movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each additional creature brought with you.

Cheliax: Egorian Academy Infernal Binder School

The prestigious Egorian Academy of the Magical Arts in Cheliax's capital city teaches a full spectrum of magic, both specialized and universalist, but the college is best known for its Infernal Binding program in the school of conjuration. An infernal binder learns the Names of Hell, and can use those powers to summon and bind devils to do her bidding. If she makes a single mistake in the binding, she opens herself to an eternity of torment. Egorian Academy wizards are recognized across Avistan as premier practitioners of the arcane arts. Many hold high positions in magical colleges across Golarion, but most seek to return one day to teach at their alma mater in Egorian.

Suggested Opposition Schools: Divination, illusion, or transmutation.

Alignment: Lawful Evil, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, or Neutral.

Requirements: An infernal binder must choose a familiar as her arcane bond at 1st level.

Associated School: Conjuration.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the acid dart and dimensional steps powers of the conjuration school.

Planar Knowledge (Ex): As an infernal binder, you gain a +3 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks.

Assume Control (Su): At 1st level, you can attempt to gain control over a summoned creature by disrupting the bond between it and the caster who summoned it. You must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) equal to 10 + the summoning caster's level. If you know the summoned creature's name, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus on the check. If the check is successful, you can control the summoned creature as if you had summoned it for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1 round). This does not increase the duration of the original summoning. The original summoning caster can attempt to regain control of the summoned creature as a standard action by making a caster level check against your caster level + 10. When your control ends, the creature reverts to the control of its summoner. At 9th level, you can use this ability to bargain with called creatures as if you were the caster who conjured them. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Imp Familiar (Ex): At 7th level, you gain Improved Familiar as a bonus feat, and must take an imp as a familiar. The imp replaces your current familiar.

Associated School: Conjuration.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the acid dart power and the dimensional steps power of the conjuration school.

Create Gear (Su): At 1st level, you can create any object that weighs no more than 1 pound per wizard level you possess. Creating an object in this way is a standard action. The item remains for 1 minute before fading away, although it disappears after one round if it leaves your possession. Creating an item to an exact specification might require a Craft skill check, subject to GM discretion. The object must be made of simple materials, such as wood, stone, glass, or metal, and cannot contain any moving parts. You could use this ability to create a dagger, but not a vial of alchemist's fire. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Creator's Will (Sp): At 8th level, you can cast minor creation as a spell-like ability. You can have no more than one minor creation active at a time. If you cast the spell again, the previous casting immediately ends. At 12th level, this ability improves to major creation. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

Associated School: Conjuration.

Replacement Powers: The following school power replaces the summoner's charm power of the conjuration school.

Reshape Space (Su): Whenever you cast a spell that creates an extradimensional space or demiplane, increase the duration by a number of units (rounds, minutes, hours, etc.) equal to 1/2 your wizard level (minimum 1). At 20th level, you can make one spell that creates an extradimensional space or demiplane permanent. You can have no more than one such spell made permanent in this way at a time. If you designate another spell as permanent, the previous permanent spell ends.

You can move 5 feet for every two wizard levels you possess (minimum 5 feet). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.
