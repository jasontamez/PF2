Fiendish Heritage

You possess a strong tie to your fiendish ancestors, granting you favorable abilities.

Prerequisites: Tiefling, must be taken at 1st level.

Benefit: Your fiendish bloodline proves particularly strong, being tied to a specific race of fiends. Rather than taking a tiefling's usual racial ability modifiers, choose one of the tiefling heritage modifiers presented on page 64. In addition, you may roll on the Variant Tiefling Abilities table three times and choose the most favorable ability.

Nethys Note: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8qzz?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-Fiends">Blood of Fiends pgs. 18-23</a> reprints the tiefling heritages and does not require players to select the Fiendish Heritage feat to take one.
