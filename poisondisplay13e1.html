Description

Ossivane mimics the petrification capability of cockatrices, but the toxin relies on the victim's heart pumping hard to spread the poison throughout the body as it stiffens limbs and locks joints. After the initial save, the victim attempts an additional Fortitude save against the poison only during rounds in which she takes a move, standard, or full-round action.
