Description

This lightweight iron lantern houses a citrine gemstone that shines brightly with arcane energy as if affected by a permanent light spell. The bearer can suppress the lantern's light or cause it to resume with a command word. Additionally, once per day by saying a different command word, the bearer can use the lantern to cast glitterdust in a 10-foot-radius spread. Any creature caught in the effect must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or be blinded for 3 rounds.
