Description

Kazavon's shattered ribs were twisted into a mantle of bone fragments known as the Shredskin. The mantle grants its wearer a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, a +5 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and the ability to hide in plain sight as per the shadowdancer class feature. The wearer can speak with any shadow, in a way similar to the effects of the spell stone tell. Shadows willingly tell the wearer what dangers they obscure and what creatures have come in contact with them in the past 24 hours. The shadows can only relate information about creatures they've enshrouded. Creatures bearing a light source are not usually touched by shadows, though shadows can tell when they've been disrupted by passing light.

Destruction

The Shredskin must be taken to the Positive Energy Plane or Sarenrae's domain on Nirvana and exposed to direct light for 1 month.
