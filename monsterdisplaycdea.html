Special Abilities

Blessing of Pain (Su) In exchange for its sacrifice to Zon-Kuthon, a Joyful Thing gains a profane bonus equal to its Charisma bonus to AC, on all saving throws, and on attack and damage rolls. A Joyful Thing whose alignment shifts away from lawful evil for any reason loses these bonuses.

Exploit Pain (Su) A Joyful Thing gains a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against any target under the effects of an emotion, fear, or pain effect.

Taste Fear (Su) As a standard action, a Joyful Thing can attempt to pin a grappled target by wrapping its elongated tongue around the creature's head. While the target is so pinned, the Joyful Thing can read its thoughts as if it were under the effect of detect thoughts.

Umbral Embrace (Su) A Joyful Thing is always treated as if it qualified for its Improved Grapple feat, even though most Joyful Things do not have the normal requisite Dexterity score or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.

Description

The most dedicated of Zon-Kuthon's faithful sometimes undergo a brutal ritual in which their limbs are amputated and their nonvital organs are removed. This imbues the so-called Joyful Things with powers drawn from the Plane of Shadow but also makes them embodiments of pain, sacrifice, and the eternal torment that awaits Kuthites in the afterlife. These exemplars of the Midnight Lord's glorious suffering hold positions of influence among other Kuthites, and any temple that hosts one or more Joyful Things is considered blessed by the god of darkness.
