Special Abilities

Fade Away (Ex) Fading foxes take their name from their uncanny ability to change their coloration. As a standard action, a fading fox can alter the coloration of its pelt, allowing it to attempt Stealth checks without cover or concealment, even while being observed. It can use this ability only in natural settings.

Description

"Smarter than my own children," is the common refrain from those nobles who-ve pitted their hunting skills against the fading fox. Agile, alert, and clever, these handsome beasts find few traps or enclosures they can't escape-and few gardens or larders they can't enter. To aristocratic hunters, they represent the ultimate quarry to track, leaving no footprints, running confusing trails, and easily vanishing from sight, but to the common people of western Taldor, fading foxes have become a surprisingly common and persistent pests they have neither the ability nor the permission to trap.
