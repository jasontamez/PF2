Description

This thick leather belt is adorned with several oversized iron plates and disks depicting images of orc gladiators in battle. The wearer of a victor's belt gains a +2 morale bonus on all combat maneuver checks and to Combat Maneuver Defense. In addition, the wearer can enter a rage (as the rage spell) as a standard action once per day. Whenever the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to at least half his current hit points in a single round, there is a 50% chance that the belt activates its rage ability automatically as an immediate action, provided the power has not already been activated that day and the wearer is not already raging. Regardless of how the rage is activated, it lasts for 5 rounds.
