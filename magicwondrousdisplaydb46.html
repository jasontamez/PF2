Description

Poison gum is often used by agents of Norgorber, particularly those alchemists and poisoners who venerate the insidious god as Blackfingers. Chewing a piece of poison gum-which resembles nothing so much as a lump of congealed sap-is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, though the user can continue to chew the gum as a free action on consecutive rounds. Doing so fills the user's mouth with three doses of Medium spider venom (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560). This poison lasts for up to 5 minutes before losing its potency. As a swift action while chewing poison gum, the user can apply the poison to a wielded weapon. If the user lacks the poison use class feature, there is a 5% chance that he exposes herself to the poison while chewing the gum or applying the poison to a weapon, and if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon, he also exposes himself to the poison.
