Description

These alchemical beads function as sentry seeds, but are also filled with an alchemical gas that explodes on contact with the air. This explosion is louder and flashier than the pop of normal sentry seeds (Perception DC 0). Creatures within 5 feet of the beads when they break must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round.
