Angels are a race of good outsiders native to the good-aligned Outer Planes. An angel has the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision. </li><li>+4 racial bonus on saves against poison. </li><li>Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification. </li><li>Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10. </li><li>Protective Aura (Su): Against attacks from or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a <a href="spelldisplay876d.html?ItemName=magic%20circle%20against%20evil">magic circle against evil</a> effect and a <a href="spelldisplay011a.html?ItemName=globe%20of%20invulnerability,%20lesser">lesser globe of invulnerability</a>, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals the angel's HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's statistics. </li><li>Truespeech (Su): All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <a href="spelldisplay4d62.html?ItemName=tongues">tongues</a> spell (caster level equal to the angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.</li></ul>
