Description

You weaken the target's defenses against poison. The target gains a -4 penalty on saves against poison, and poisons affecting the target continue for another 2 frequency increments (for example, black adder venom lasts 8 rounds instead of 6, and arsenic lasts for 6 minutes instead of 4). Attempts to cure the poisoned target with skill or magic take a -4 penalty.

Mythic Pernicious Poison

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8ywe?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Mythic-Adventures">Mythic Adventures pg. 103</a>
The number of successful saving throws needed to cure a poison increases by one. If the poison deals ability damage on a failed saving throw, that ability damage increases by 1.

Augmented (6th): If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target's penalty on saves against poison increases to -8, and the penalty for attempting to cure the target with skill or magic increases to -8.

If you expend three uses of mythic power, the poison bypasses the creature's poison immunity (this doesn't affect poison immunity from not having a Constitution score).
