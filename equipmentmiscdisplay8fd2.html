Description

A sanctified shield may be any type of shield (including bucklers, tower shields, and even magical shields). When activated, a sacred shield adds a +1 sacred (if positive energy) or profane (if negative energy) bonus to the wearer's Armor Class. This bonus lasts for 24 hours or until the wearer is struck in combat, whichever comes first. Creatures other than the cleric are able to use the charged shield and this ability.
