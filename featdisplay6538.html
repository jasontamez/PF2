Your melee blows deal extra damage to creatures sensitive to light, making you adept at hunting foul monsters of the night.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay7c1b.html?ItemName=Arcane%20Strike">Arcane Strike</a>, able to prepare or cast daylight.

Benefit:  Whenever you successfully hit an enemy that is vulnerable to light (such as by the light blindness, light sensitivity, or sunlight powerlessness universal monster rules) with a melee weapon you've imbued with your Arcane Strike feat, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage to the target of your attack. The struck creature must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + your character level + your Strength modifier) or become staggered for 1 round.
