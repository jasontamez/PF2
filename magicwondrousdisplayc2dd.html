Description

This small talisman is comprised of teeth, fingers, ears, or
other grotesque trophies taken from the freshly dead. Each
talisman is imbued with an intense animosity toward a
particular type of creature, chosen from the ranger favored
enemy list when the fetish is created. Once per day, the
talisman can impart this animosity to a ranger (or other
character with the favored enemy class feature), replacing
one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated
creature type. This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the
ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then
may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the
item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6
favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating
fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons
and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively,
once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift
action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer
only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the
ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored
enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).
