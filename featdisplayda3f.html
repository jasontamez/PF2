No Name - Feats







No Name (Grit)

You don't need an elaborate disguise to keep your identity under wraps.

Prerequisites: Grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger feat, Bluff 4 ranks.

Benefit:  You often rely on surprise and misdirection in your social dealings. You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks, and you can spend 1 grit point to gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks for 10 minutes per your gunslinger level (minimum 10 minutes). This deed does not actually change your appearance, but rather allows you to hide your identity in other ways.
