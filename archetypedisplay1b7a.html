Proclaimer

A proclaimer is the polar opposite of a faithful wanderer (see above), rushing into Abyss-twisted wastes with nothing but his weapon in his hand and his faith in his heart, shouting his deity's name to the skies. Most proclaimers don't survive their first day in a hostile environment, but those who do become the stuff of legend, bolstering the spirits of crusaders near and far.

Righteous Oath: A proclaimer cannot be evil or worship an evil deity, and he must choose cure spells for his spontaneous casting.

This alters the warpriest's spellcasting.

Cleanser of Evil (Su): At 2nd level, a proclaimer can hold his weapon aloft and shout his deity's name as a swift action, spending one use of fervor to deal 1d6 points of damage to all evil outsiders within 5 feet. At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, this damage increases by an additional 1d6. This damage has the same alignment as the proclaimer's deity (for example, it counts as good and lawful for a worshiper of Ragathiel who uses this ability). At 7th level, the effect expands to include an area within 10 feet of the proclaimer, and it expands by 5 feet every 6 levels thereafter. A proclaimer can't use fervor to damage undead or to heal.

This alters fervor and replaces sacred armor.

Zone of Sanctification (Su): At 4th level, when a proclaimer uses fervor to damage evil outsiders with his cleanser of evil ability, he can spend one additional use of fervor as a move action to create a zone of sanctification in the same area for 1 round. All evil outsiders in the zone when it becomes active must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + half the proclaimer's level + his Wisdom modifier) or be pushed back until they are out of the area. Evil outsiders that end their turns in the area take damage as if affected by cleanser of evil.

This replaces channel energy.
