The lives you could not save stay with you to your final breath.


Prerequisites: You must have witnessed the death of a
close companion in battle-a death that could have been
prevented, such as from bleeding, failure to stabilize, or ongoing poison damage-or have the Death in the
Family or The War background.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks. If you have
10 or more ranks in Heal, this bonus increases to +4. You
can apply first aid as a move action and don't take a penalty
when treating deadly wounds without a healing kit.


Goal: Bring an ally back from the
dead, including by using breath of life
or reincarnate.


Completion Benefit: You and each ally
within 10 feet of you gain a +2 bonus on saves
against death effects. In addition, once per day
you can spontaneously convert any 5th-level or
higher conjuration (healing) spell into breath of life.
