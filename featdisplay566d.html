You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefit of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When you are the target of a disarm combat maneuver, you can spend a number of stamina points up to your Strength or Dexterity bonus, whichever is greater. Your CMD against that disarm attempt increases by that number.
