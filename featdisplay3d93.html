The promise of Elysium's freedom liberates you from all forms of restraint, allowing you to move as you will and to avoid numerous kinds of restraints that would otherwise vex a traveler or explorer.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks.

Benefit: As a swift action, you gain the benefits of freedom of movement until the end of your turn or until you benefit from the effects to escape a grapple or magical restraint, whichever comes first.

You can use this feat's benefit once per day, plus an additional time per day for every 5 ranks you have in Knowledge (planes).
