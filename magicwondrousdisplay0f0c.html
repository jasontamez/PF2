Description

This sticky henna paste is used to stamp a rust-colored handprint
onto the body of a familiar or animal companion, and a hoof,
claw, or paw print from that creature onto its master. These
brands demonstrate a bond of friendship and balance, not
ownership and subservience. Applying the brand requires a
full-round action each for master and companion. The brand
enhances the share spells ability of druids, wizards, and other
classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing these
characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the
marked companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character
has line of effect to the creature. Each spell cast at range in this
way drains one charge from the beast-bond brand for each spell
level of the spell cast. A newly applied beast-bond brand has 10
charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes.
For the purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master
may treat a marked companion as an object or a creature,
whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still apply).


A character may have only one creature marked in this way
at any time. The brand lasts until all charges are expended or
the master marks another companion in this way.
