You have spent enough time around dragons to believe that much of their fearsomeness is bluster.

Prerequisites: Favored enemy (dragon) or Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against extraordinary or supernatural fear effects (such as a dragon's frightful presence). If a failed saving throw against an extraordinary or supernatural fear effect would make you frightened, you are instead shaken; and if a failed saving throw would make you panicked, you are instead frightened.
