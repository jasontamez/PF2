Description

This wooden disk bears the image of a mother-sphinx, a symbol of Absalom that epitomizes knowledge and arcane power, brought by Osirian families in the city's early years. Once per day, the user can designate an enemy within 100 feet and speak a command word. When she does, any spells she casts in the next 2 rounds that target the designated enemy are affected as if she were under the effects of an arcane concordance spell.
