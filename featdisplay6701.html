Your musical skill, dramatic timing, or mastery of language make you seem more personable.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Perform (any) 1 rank, bardic performance or raging song.

Benefit:  You can use Perform, rather than Diplomacy, to improve an NPC's starting attitude toward you. Alternatively, by praising another character, you may use Perform to improve an NPC's starting attitude toward another character, though the DC for doing so is increased by 5. Either use of this feat requires at least 5 minutes of performance. You can't improve an NPC's attitude beyond friendly in this way, but if you would have made them helpful, you gain a +2 bonus on your next normal Diplomacy check against that NPC attempted within 24 hours.

If the campaign uses the contact rules (Ultimate Campaign 148), seeing you perform can count as up to four of the five positive interactions required to cultivate a contact.
