Description

This +2 flaming burst longbow's arrow rest is shaped like a dragon's head with its mouth agape-as if about to unleash its breath weapon. A mythic wielder can expend one use of mythic power when drawing back the bow to create an arrow of pure flame. This flame arrow acts as a ranged touch attack that can target only creatures within the first range increment of the bow. When it hits its target, this flame arrow deals 3d10+2 points of fire damage. This damage stacks with the bow's flaming burst special ability.
