Description

This tiny dropper contains a liquid that speeds up the cure time of alchemical glue. Applying the accelerant is a standard action. Accelerated glue is tacky after 1 round and fully cured in 1 minute. The dropper contains 20 doses; each dose is sufficient to cure one small application of alchemical glue. The entire dropper must be used to cure a full square foot of glue.
