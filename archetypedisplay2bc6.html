Undead masters have great power over undeath.

Necromantic Focus: An undead master must be of an evil alignment. If he becomes nonevil, he can still use his powers but can't progress any further as a wizard. Most undead masters specialize in the necromancy school, and an undead master can't have necromancy as an opposition school.

This alters arcane school and alignment.

Necropolitan (Ex): An undead master gains a bonus equal to half his wizard level (minimum +1) on Diplomacy and Knowledge checks regarding undead creatures. Because of his obsessive focus on the undead, he takes a -2 penalty when attempting such checks regarding living creatures.

Corpse Bond (Su): An undead master can forge an arcane bond with an object, but that object must be made at least partially of bone. Alternatively, he can animate a corpse companion, as per the undead lord cleric archetype (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 32). He can't gain a familiar.

This ability alters arcane bond.

Command Undead (Su): An undead master gains Command Undead as a bonus feat, treating his wizard level as his cleric level. If he lacks the ability to channel negative energy for the purpose of Command Undead, he can expend 3 uses of any 1st-level arcane school ability that normally has a number of uses per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier, rather than a use of channel energy. If he's a necromancer with the power over undead ability, he instead gains Improved Channel.

This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.

Reanimator (Su): An undead master adds the following spells to his spellbook at the given wizard levels: 1st-repair undead; 3rd-lesser animate dead; 5th-animate dead; 7th-undead anatomy I; 9th-create undead; 11th-undeath to death; 13th-create greater undead; 15th-undead anatomy IV; 17th-cursed earth. He can spontaneously cast any of these spells by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same level or higher. The undead master can cast lesser animate dead, animate dead, create undead, and create greater undead as if they were 1 level lower than their normal wizard spell level; this does not alter their level for the purpose of item crafting and the like.

This ability replaces the bonus feats gained at 5th, 10th, and 15th levels.

Lich-Loved (Su): At 20th level, an undead master gains the benefits of the undead sorcerer bloodline's one of us ability.

This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 20th level.
