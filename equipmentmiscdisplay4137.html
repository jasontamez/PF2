Description

Perfume and cologne are common accessories for those who hope to avoid offending through scent. Exotic scents are sold in vials containing 10 applications, with a single dose lasting for 24 hours during which its wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on all Diplomacy checks (save for those against creatures who, at the GM's discretion, would not be swayed by scent).
