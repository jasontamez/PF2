Though bards may have different reasons for wanting to heal the sick and injured, both out of pure altruism and in order to keep adventuring companions safe, the ability to heal also makes it much easier for a bard to pose as a cleric or other divine healer, opening the door for a wide array of swindles and scams.

Channel Energy (Su):  At 2nd level, an arcane healer gains the ability to <a href="classdisplay1daf.html?ItemName=Cleric">channel positive energy as a cleric</a> of one level lower than his level. If a creature within the channeled energy's area of effect would be allowed a save against its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the arcane healer's level + the arcane healer's Charisma modifier. An arcane healer can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, gaining an additional use per day every four levels thereafter (6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th), to a maximum of 5 times per day at 18th level. This ability replaces versatile performance.

Inspiring Healing (Sp):  At 5th level, an arcane healer gains the ability to expend rounds of his bardic performance to provide extra healing to his allies. By expending 2 rounds of bardic performance, an arcane healer can cast <a href="spelldisplaye3d6.html?ItemName=cure%20light%20wounds">cure light wounds</a> as a spell-like ability. At 11th level, the arcane healer can expend 2 rounds of bardic performance to cast <a href="spelldisplayb58c.html?ItemName=cure%20moderate%20wounds">cure moderate wounds</a> as a spell-like ability. At 17th level, he may instead expend 2 rounds of bardic performance to cast <a href="spelldisplayccb7.html?ItemName=cure%20serious%20wounds">cure serious wounds</a> as a spell-like ability. No single target may be affected by an arcane healer's inspiring healing ability more than once in a 24-hour period. This ability replaces loremaster.
