Bonus Feats: Diehard, Endurance, Improved Initiative, Intimidating Prowess, Leadership, Lightning Reflexes, Weapon Focus.

Bloodline Powers: Your future greatness grants you the might to strike your enemies with awe.

Destined Strike (Su): At 1st level, as a free action up to three times per day you can grant yourself an insight bonus equal to 1/2 your bloodrager level (minimum 1) on one melee attack. At 12th level, you can use this ability up to five times per day.

Fated Bloodrager (Su): At 4th level, you gain a +1 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level).

Certain Strike (Su): At 8th level, you may reroll an attack roll once during a bloodrage. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the GM reveals the results. You must take the second result, even if it's worse.

Defy Death (Su): At 12th level, once per day when an attack or spell that deals damage would result in your death, you can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. If you succeed, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point; if you succeed and already have less than 1 hit point, you instead take no damage.

Unstoppable (Su): At 16th level, any critical threats you score are automatically confirmed. Any critical threats made against you confirm only if the second roll results in a natural 20 (or is automatically confirmed).

Victory or Death (Su): At 20th level, you are immune to paralysis and petrification, as well as to the stunned, dazed, and staggered conditions. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.
