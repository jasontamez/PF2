Description

These finely crafted leather bracers have plates of silvered
steel covering the back, and silver buckles at the wrist and
forearm. The bracers enable the wearer to use any traditional
elven weapon (longbows, composite longbows, longswords,
rapiers, shortbows, composite shortbows, and any weapon
with the word "elven" in its name) as if he were proficient in
its use. If he uses such a weapon and is already proficient with
it, he gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage
rolls. Both bracers must be worn for the magic to be effective.
