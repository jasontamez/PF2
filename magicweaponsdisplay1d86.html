Description

This special ability can be placed only on reach weapons, piercing melee weapons, and weapons from the flail fighter weapon training group. When a sticky weapon scores a critical hit against a target, instead of rolling to confirm the critical threat, the wielder can deal normal damage and attempt a steal combat maneuver check against the target of the attack. This combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity, and the wielder gains a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check.
