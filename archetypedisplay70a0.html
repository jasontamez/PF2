Strong-Side Boxer

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 16</a>
A strong-side boxer employs a unique fighting style that incorporates a rope or cord wound around her hand. The wrapped hand is known as the strong side. The other hand is kept free to deflect blows, and is known as the shield. The Zenj people of the Mwangi Expanse, who gather for large boxing tournaments, developed this style for their competitions. Many guests and visitors have witnessed these tournaments over the years, and as a result, the style has spread throughout Golarion.

Shield-Hand (Ex): A strong-side boxer can use her off hand as if it were a buckler, gaining a +1 natural armor bonus to her AC as long as she does not use her off hand to make attacks. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 20th level. While using her off hand in this manner, the strong-side boxer treats that hand as a buckler for the purposes of other feats and abilities (though she is also considered to have a free hand).

This replaces the brawler's AC bonus.

Strong-Side Fist (Ex): A strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her hands in rope or cord. The strong-side boxer can carry items or wield weapons in a wrapped hand, but she takes a -2 penalty on Dexteritybased skill checks that requires the use of that hand (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks). Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with bleed damage from other sources.

This replaces maneuver training.

Lead Leg (Ex): At 5th level, a strong-side boxer can spend 1 minute to wrap one of her legs in a chain, and can thereafter use the chain-wrapped leg both defensively and offensively. While her leg is wrapped, she is considered to be wearing a chain shirt, gaining all the appropriate bonuses and penalties. The chain can be enchanted as armor and is treated as masterwork. Once per round while wearing the chain, she can apply a +4 circumstance bonus to a trip attempt as an immediate action.

This replaces close weapon mastery.
