Your deft hands allow you to perform tasks that require fine manipulation.

Functions: Conceal objects on your body, disarm traps or devices, open locks, palm objects, pilfer objects from creatures.

<a href="rules1e25.html?Name=Conceal%20Objects%20on%20Your%20Body&amp;Category=Finesse%20(Dex;%20Armor%20Check%20Penalty;%20Trained%20Only)">Conceal Objects on Your Body</a>

Hiding a small object on your person (such as a light weapon or easily concealed ranged weapon such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) requires a Finesse check opposed by the Perception check of anyone observing or frisking you. You gain a +2 bonus on this check if you're concealing a dagger. Someone frisking you gains a +4 bonus on this Perception check. The type of item you conceal and the nature of your attire can modify your check. These modifiers are cumulative.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Circumstance</td><td>Finesse DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Dagger</td><td>+2</td></tr> <tr><td>Extraordinarily small object (coin, ring, shuriken)</td><td>+4</td></tr> <tr><td>Heavy or baggy clothing</td><td>+2</td></tr> </table>

Action: Standard, or move at a -20 penalty.

Try Again: Yes, but a second attempt against the same target increases the DC by 10.

Drawing Weapons: Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

The GM rolls this type of Finesse check in secret so you don't know whether you're successful. If you succeed, you disable the device. If you fail by 4 or less, you don't disable it, but can try again. If you fail to disable a trap by 5 or more, the trap triggers. If you fail to sabotage a different type of device by 5 or more, you think you succeeded but the device actually functions normally.

You can attempt to leave no trace of your tampering, but this increases the DC by 5. You can rig simple devices (such as saddles and wagon wheels) to function normally and break after some period of time (usually 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Device</td><td>Time</td><td>Finesse DC</td><td>Example</td></tr> <tr><td>Simple</td><td>1 round</td><td>10</td><td>Jam a lock</td></tr> <tr><td>Tricky</td><td>1d4 rounds</td><td>15</td><td>Sabotage a wagon wheel</td></tr> <tr><td>Difficult</td><td>2d4 rounds</td><td>20</td><td>Disarm or reset a trap</td></tr> <tr><td>Extreme</td><td>2d4 rounds</td><td>25</td><td>Disarm a complex trap, cleverly sabotage a clockwork device</td></tr> </table>

Action: Varies (see table). Beginning or continuing the process of disarming is a full-round action.

Try Again: Yes, but only if you fail by 4 or less.

<a href="rules5997.html?Name=Open%20Locks&amp;Category=Finesse%20(Dex;%20Armor%20Check%20Penalty;%20Trained%20Only)">Open Locks</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 58</a>
The DC for opening a lock depends on the lock's quality.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Lock Quality</td><td>Finesse DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Simple</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr><td>Average</td><td>25</td></tr> <tr><td>Good</td><td>30</td></tr> <tr><td>Superior</td><td>40</td></tr> <tr><td>Lacking thieves' tools</td><td>+10</td></tr> </table>

Action: Full-round.

Try Again: Yes.

Performing a minor feat of legerdemain or palming a coin-sized, unattended object requires a successful DC 10 Finesse check. If you're under close observation, the observer notices your action if it succeeds at an opposed Perception check against your Finesse check.

Action: Standard, or move at a -20 penalty.

Try Again: Yes, but a second attempt against the same target increases the DC by 10.

<a href="rules8038.html?Name=Pilfer%20Objects%20from%20Creatures&amp;Category=Finesse%20(Dex;%20Armor%20Check%20Penalty;%20Trained%20Only)">Pilfer Objects from Creatures</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 58</a>
Surreptitiously stealing an item from a creature requires a successful DC 20 Finesse check. The opponent attempts an opposed Perception check against the result of your Finesse check. If she succeeds, she notices your attempt regardless of whether you got the item. You can't attempt to pilfer an object during combat from a creature that's aware of your presence.

Action: Standard, or move at a -20 penalty.

Try Again: Yes, but a second attempt against the same target increases the DC by 10.
