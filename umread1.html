A creature with the summon ability can summon other specific creatures of its kind much as though casting a <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a> spell, but it usually has only a limited chance of success (as specified in the creature's entry). Roll d%; on a failure, no creature answers the summons. Summoned creatures automatically return to wherever they came from after 1 hour. A creature summoned in this way cannot use any spells or spell-like abilities that require material components costing more than 1 gp unless those components are supplied, nor can it use its own summon ability for 1 hour. An appropriate spell level is given for each summoning ability for the purposes of caster level checks, concentration checks, and Will saves. No experience points are awarded for defeating summoned monsters.

Format: 1/day'summon (level 4, 1 <a href="monsterdisplay00e4-2.html?ItemName=Hezrou">hezrou</a> 35%)
