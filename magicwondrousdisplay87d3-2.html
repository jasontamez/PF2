Description

This elegant, perfumed handkerchief always seems to be a dazzling white. The bearer can attune the handkerchief to himself by keeping it in his possession for 1 week. Once the handkerchief is attuned to its bearer, the bearer can always sense in what direction the handkerchief is, so long as it is on the same plane. A bearer unaware of the handkerchief's power cannot attune to it.
