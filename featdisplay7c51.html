What once belonged to your family shall be yours again.


Prerequisites: Your family must have claim to an inherited
title or position that no longer belongs to them, or have
the Dishonored Family background. You can take this feat
even if you have no knowledge of this lost family title.

Benefit:  You gain a +1 bonus on Charisma-based ability
checks and skill checks.


Goal:  Regain your family's lost claim, either for yourself
or another in your family. In the process of completing this
claim, you must decisively defeat a challenging foe that
seeks to deny your birthright.


Completion Benefit:  You gain a +1 bonus on Wisdom
ability checks, Wisdom-based skill checks, and Will
saving throws.


Special:  If you manage to regain your position without
defeating a challenging foe, you may still complete this
story feat at a later date if a suitable challenging foe
attempts to steal your birthright again.
