CR Increase +1

Description

This modification causes a construct to explode in a shower of razor-sharp scrap and debris when it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. All creatures within a 10-foot burst of the construct take a number of points of slashing damage equal to 1d6 times the construct's CR. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the construct's Hit Dice + the construct's Constitution modifier) halves this damage. If a construct already has a similar ability, such as the death burst of a <a href="monsterdisplay9d80.html?ItemName=Clockwork%20Golem">clockwork golem</a>, the DC of the ability instead increases by 4.
