Many of those who dwell among the rooftops that span much of Korvosa become skillful at making bounding leaps and clambering up steep surfaces, and learn how to land more safely when they fall.

Prerequisites: Dex 12, Acrobatics.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Acrobatics and Climb checks, and can take 10 on Climb checks even when distracted. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill. If you fall, you automatically reduce the damage taken by the fall by 1d6, as if you-d fallen 10 feet less. This reduction in damage stacks with the reduction from a successful Acrobatics check to soften a fall.
