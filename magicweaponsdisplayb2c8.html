Description

A redeemed weapon was once a corrupt unholy weapon. The
taint of evil has been purged from it, however, and the weapon
is now in all ways a holy weapon, dealing an additional 2d6
points of damage against all creatures of evil alignment. In
addition, the wielder gains a sacred bonus on saving throws
equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus against the spells
and abilities of evil outsiders and a +5 competence bonus on
Knowledge (planes) checks to identify evil outsiders and their
special powers or vulnerabilities. When the redeemed weapon
special ability is added to an unholy weapon, the weapon loses
the unholy property and gains the redeemed property, and the
crafter must pay the price of adding a +1 enhancement bonus
to the weapon.
