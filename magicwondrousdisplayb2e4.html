Description

These black iron pauldrons are studded with jagged spikes
of various lengths. Demonspike pauldrons act as +2 armor
spikes and also deal 1d2 bleed damage on a successful
grapple attack or melee attack made with the pauldrons. If
these pauldrons are worn with normal armor spikes, increase
the damage done by the armor spikes to 1d6 (Small) or 1d8
(Medium), and use the greater of the two enhancement
bonuses to attack and damage-either from the armor spikes
(if any) or the demonspike pauldrons.
