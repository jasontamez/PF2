Beatific One - Monsters







Beatific One

This tall, feminine figure has golden tanned skin and well-formed curves, suggesting years of activity and work toward physical perfection. Beneath her diaphanous robes, the creature's legs cross over one another, while six arms-two facing toward her back- wave in a continuous dance. Three fanged heads sit atop a sturdy neck, studying every direction.

Special Abilities

Continuous Barrage (Ex) If a beatific one hits with the last attack of its flurry of blows, it may attempt an additional attack at a -2 penalty. If this attack hits, the beatific one may continue to make additional attacks, with a cumulative -2 penalty for each subsequent attack (-4 for the second attack, -6 for the third, and so on). If any attack misses, the barrage ends.

Flurry of Blows (Ex) The beatific one can attempt a flurry of blows as per the monk ability. It may use this ability whenever it has at least two of its six hands free or a special monk weapon equipped (see page 40 of the PH).

Monk Qualities A beatific one emulates many of the strengths of the monk character class. On top of its own racial abilities, the beatific one receives the AC bonus, unarmed damage, bonus feats, speed bonus, and weapon proficiencies of a monk with a level equal to its Hit Dice, along with the diamond body, flurry of blows, improved evasion, and still mind abilities. All of these benefits are included in the statistics above.

Summon Asura (Sp) Once per day, a beatific one can attempt to summon 1 beatific one with a 40% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

Description

Scions of the vast and enigmatic pantheon of Vudrani deities, beatific ones torment mortal warriors, torture evil souls, and mete out the wrath of the gods. Paragons of physical perfection, these fiends are said to be masters of every weapon ever crafted and innately familiar with the forms and ways of every martial art imagined. When loosed upon the mortal world, these asuras-fiendish servants of the Vudrani deities-bring woe to warriors, brutally test the philosophies of martial orders, and seek great battles in which to participate.

Beatific ones move with the grace of master martial artists and hone their fiendish forms through endless combat and morbid meditations. They stand 7 feet tall and weigh approximately 240 pounds.
