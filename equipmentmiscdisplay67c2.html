Description

This hard-bristled tool has a handle that slips over the wearer's hand, and is used by animal breeders, owners, and grooms to brush the animals in their care, loosening dirt and detritus from the creatures' coats and stimulating the skin so it produces the natural oils that keep them healthy and clean.
