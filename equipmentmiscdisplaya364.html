Description

This air-filled leather or organ bladder ends in a trailing rope weighed down with a 40-pound stone or piece of metal. The weight is just heavy enough to counteract the bladder's buoyancy and cause it to sink. When the rope is cut free from the weight and tied to an object weighing less than 40 pounds, the lifting bag rises to the surface with its cargo (the lighter the cargo, the faster the ascent). Lifting bags collapse under too much pressure and are destroyed if brought to a depth greater than 200 feet.
