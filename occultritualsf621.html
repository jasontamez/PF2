Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

By reciting false litanies associated with the various deities represented among the holy symbol foci, the primary caster shakes the unseen spiritual pillars of the mortal world. This ritual has no visible effect to mortal eyes, but it creates a powerful rending cut in the world of spirits. By successfully completing this ritual, the caster can achieve one of two goals: severing a kami from its ward, or untethering a bound companion.

Sever Kami Ward: Successfully completing the ritual forces the ward's <a href="monsterdisplay7511.html?ItemName=Shikigami">kami</a> to attempt a Will save (use the kami's Will save in the case of targeting its ward). On a failed save, the kami loses its connection with its ward. This functions as if the kami's ward were destroyed: the kami cannot merge with its ward, it loses its fast healing, and it is permanently sickened. Many kami suffering from this cruel fate transform into malicious oni.

Untether Companion: Successfully completing the ritual forces the creature whose animal or spiritual companion, such as an eidolon or phantom, was targeted to attempt a Will save. Failing this save causes the creature to lose its bond with the targeted animal companion or spirit. An animal companion severed in this manner retains its abilities and statistics, but it gains an intense loathing for its former master. In the case of eidolons or phantoms, the severed companion gains the <a href="monsterdisplayfe4a.html?ItemName=Unfettered%20Eidolon">unfettered eidolon</a> template or becomes an <a href="monsterdisplay7d67-2.html?ItemName=Unfettered%20Phantom">unfettered phantom</a> with the appropriate Hit Dice. For creatures with animal companions, this functions as if the creature's companion had been slain, allowing the target to gain a new companion. For creatures with bonded spirits (such as <a href="classdisplay5e64.html?ItemName=Spiritualist">spiritualists</a>), the means of gaining a new companion are left to the GM's discretion.
