The following are the main reactions of this system.

Complete a Readied Action (Varies): When you have readied an action or advanced action, when the trigger you designate occurs, you can take that action. Unlike in the default action economy, your place in the initiative order does not change. This reaction's subtype is the same as the readied action's subtype.

Make an Attack of Opportunity: When a foe you threaten provokes an attack of opportunity, you can make a single melee attack against that foe.

Spend a Use of an Attack of Opportunity: If an ability you possess allows you to spend a use of an attack of opportunity to perform some other action in the default action economy, that action is a reaction in this system.

Use an Immediate-Action Ability: You can use an ability that can be used as an immediate action in the default action economy, as long as any conditions to use that ability are met.
