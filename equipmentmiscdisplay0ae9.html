Description

If inhaled through the nose, this sootysmelling golden powder renders humanoid males temporarily sterile without otherwise affecting their performance. A dose typically lasts 1-3 days. Long-term users of bachelor snuff tend to develop a slight, but still noticeable, gilded tinge to their teeth and nails.
