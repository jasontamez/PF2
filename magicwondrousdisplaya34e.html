Description

When worn, this mask transforms the wearer's face into a
stone statue and its voice into an emotionless monotone.
Though it allows the wearer to speak, its facial expressions
and voice betray little emotion, granting a +10 competence
bonus on Bluff checks made to lie and a +5 competence
bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, but also imposing a -5
penalty on Bluff checks made to pass a hidden message.
