Description

This +1 adamantine light fortification full plate is crafted from tightly fitted smooth, dull plates trimmed in gold. As adamantine heavy armor, it grants its wearer DR 3/-. When the armor is not worn, a creature can touch the armor and speak a command word to cause the armor to leap up and fit itself to that creature. The armor is considered properly donned when put on in this way. The wearer can speak the command word to have the armor remove itself and, if not restrained, stack itself neatly nearby or arrange itself on an appropriate armor rack, if one is adjacent.
