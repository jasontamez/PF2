Description

Silvery, pearlescent light seeps out of this skull-sized glass orb. When shattered (a standard action), the globe floods a 30-footradius burst in moonlight. Creatures that are affected by the light of the full moon (such as an afflicted lycanthrope) are affected as if exposed to such light, and effects that rely on moonlight function within range of this effect. This moonlight persists for 1 minute, is treated as dim light (replacing any current illumination in the area), and is equivalent to a 4th-level light spell for the purpose of interacting with other light or darkness effects.
