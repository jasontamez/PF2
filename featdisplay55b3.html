You are adept at defending yourself during psychic duels.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Psychic Sensitivity or the ability to cast psychic spells or use psychic spell-like abilities, character level 3rd.

Benefit:  Each time you enter a psychic duel, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your manifesting level (see Psychic Duels on page 202). These temporary hit points last until the end of the psychic duel.
