The quintessential dragonslayers, dragon hunters are
experts at forging through the wilds in search of great
wyrms. Dragon hunters have the following class features.


Class Skills: A dragon hunter adds Knowledge (arcana)
to his list of class skills, in addition to the normal ranger
class skills.

Predatory Deduction (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, when
a dragon hunter successfully uses Survival to spot the
trail of a creature of the dragon type, the hunter may
attempt an immediate DC 15 Knowledge (arcana) check.
On a success, the dragon hunter is able to deduce the
species, age category, size, and color of the dragon. If the
trail is less than 48 hours old, the dragon hunter gains
a +2 circumstance bonus on the Knowledge check. This
ability replaces Track.


Wyrm Hatred (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, a dragon
hunter must select dragons as his favored enemy, granting
him a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense
Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of the
dragon type. He also gains +2 bonuses on weapon attack
and damage rolls against them. These bonuses increase
by +2 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th,
15th, and 20th level).


Dragoncrafting (Ex): Dragon hunters are experts not
only at tracking and killing dragons, but also at using
dragon bodies to craft unique equipment. A dragon
hunter gains Dragoncrafting as a bonus feat at 5th level,
even if she does not meet the prerequisites. See page 18
of this book for more information. This ability replaces
the additional favored enemy and any bonuses to existing
favored enemies gained at 5th level.


Undaunted (Ex): Beginning at 10th level, a dragon
hunter gains a +4 bonus on Will saves made to resist
mind-affecting fear effects, Reflex saves made to avoid
damage from breath weapons, Reflex saves made to
avoid crush attacks, and Reflex saves made to avoid
damage from tail sweep attacks. This ability replaces the
additional favored enemy and any bonuses to existing
favored enemies gained at 10th level.


Expert Dragoncrafter (Ex): At 15th level, a dragon
hunter may take 10 on Heal and Craft skill checks to
harvest dragoncraft materials and to create dragoncraft
items. Additionally, the amount of time required to
create a dragoncraft item is reduced by half. This ability
replaces the additional favored enemy and any bonuses to
existing favored enemies gained at 15th level.


Elemental Resilience (Su): At 20th level, a dragon
hunter gains energy resistance 30 against a single energy
type for 1 hour. The energy types he may choose are acid,
cold, electricity, and fire. He may use this ability once per
day. This ability replaces the additional favored enemy
and any bonuses to existing favored enemies gained at
20th level.
