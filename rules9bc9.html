Characters in horror-themed campaigns are usually no less skilled or powerful than those in other Pathfinder RPG campaigns. The GM might also have special guidelines or expectations for the game's characters' particularly in the cases of supposedly fearless classes, like <a href="classdisplay3035.html?ItemName=Paladin">paladins</a>'so make sure that you and she are on the same page regarding character creation before you get to work.

During the process of creating your character, also keep this question in mind: What is my character afraid of? This isn't something that's going to come back and make your character weaker; it's a consideration to help you get into your character's head. Probably the biggest difference between horror adventures and other games is that they encourage you to have a more intimate understanding of your character as an individual, not just as an assemblage of numbers. Take a look at the sidebar on page 9 and consider working some of those elements into your thoughts about your character. These story elements will help your GM involve your character more deeply in the story, and help you as a player understand what your character fears and how your character might confront or avoid those fears.
