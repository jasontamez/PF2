Cinder Wolf - Monsters







Cinder Wolf

This wolf-like beast has a charred and blackened hide, its flesh split in places and seeping a fiery red ooze. The slaving creature stalks closer, snarling gutturally as cinders flicker from its maw.

Special Abilities

Fast Healing (Ex) A cinder wolf heals 1 point of damage every round that it resists a point or more of fire damage, so long as it has at least 1 hit point. This fire must be from an external source, not from a cinder wolf's fiery bite.

Fiery Body (Su) A cinderwolf inflicts 1d4 points of fire damage when it bites a foe in addition to the normal bite damage. In any round that the cinderwolf resists at least one point of fire damage, it gains fast healing 3.

Trip (Ex) A cinder wolf that hits with a bite attack can attempt to trip the opponent (+3 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the cinder wolf.

Description

Vicious predators and tireless trackers, cinder wolves are a relentless threat to the travelers and native tribes who make the Cinderlands their home. Ravenous creatures that endlessly hunt to fuel their fiery metabolisms, cinder wolves attack nearly any creature, from well-armored horned spirestalkers and ember scorpions to Shoanti barbarians and even stone giant warriors. Fleet footed and fearsome in appearance, these tenacious pack hunters thrive amid the flames of the Cinderlands, their fiery bites and relentless hunger embodying the deadliness of the burning plains.

An adult cinder wolf stands just over 3 feet tall and weighs up to 200 pounds. What little fur they have is often singed and black, but can also be ash-gray. Their eyes are frequently bloodshot red with yellow irises.

Cinder Wolf Pelts

The hides of cinder wolves prove exceptionally useful in the creation of heat resilient armors. By making a DC 16 Survival check, one can successfully skin a cinder wolf, leaving its coarse pelt in quality good enough to work into armor or other goods. Should this pelt be used later in the creation of a suit of hide armor (in addition to all the normal materials, DC 13 Craft [armorsmithing]), that armor can be enhanced with the fire resistance, improved fire resistance, or greater fire resistance special abilities at 75% of the normal price.

A cinder wolf pelt is an uncommon commodity and can rarely be found for sale, the bristly fur being uncomfortable and hard to work with and the demand-despite their usefulness in magic-is limited. Even when found in Varisian markets, the cost is typically upwards of 600 gp. Thus, most who desire a cinder wolf pelt are forced to either find and skin a cinder wolf himself, or trade with Shoanti native to the Cinderlands.

Training Cinder Wolves

The constant hunger and pain cinder wolves endure make them hard to manage and even more difficult to tame. Taming a cinder wolf requires 6 weeks of work and a DC 25 Handle Animal check. This DC decreases to 20 if the beast is trained in an area that is constantly 100 degrees or hotter. Even after this initial training, though, the DCs of all attempts to further train a cinder wolf are 5 higher, unless they're again made in areas of extreme heat. Although difficult to teach and quick to disobey, cinder wolves make excellent trackers and are widely coveted by hunters on the Storval Plateau and beyond.
