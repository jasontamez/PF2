Once you have your first settlement, you have the start of a kingdom. You'll need to make some initial decisions that affect your kingdom's statistics, and record them on the kingdom sheet (see page 227).

Choose Your Kingdom's Alignment. Your kingdom's alignment helps determine how loyal, prosperous, and stable your kingdom is. Your kingdom may be a lawful good bastion against a nearby land of devil worshipers, or a chaotic neutral territory of cutthroat traders whose government does very little to interfere with the rights of its citizens.

Choose Leadership Roles. Assign the <a href="rulesd3f4.html?Name=Leadership%20Roles&amp;Category=Kingdom%20Building">leadership roles</a> for all PCs and NPCs involved in running the kingdom, such as Ruler, General, and High Priest. The leadership roles provide bonuses on checks made to collect taxes, deal with rioting citizens, and resolve similar issues.



Start Your Treasury. The build points you have left over from starting your first settlement make up your initial Treasury.

Determine Your Kingdom's Attributes. Your initial Economy, Loyalty, and Stability scores are based on the kingdom's alignment and the buildings your settlement has. (If you start with more than one settlement, include all the settlements in this reckoning.)

Once you've completed these steps, move on to <a href="rulesae63.html?Name=Kingdom%20Turn%20Sequence&amp;Category=Kingdom%20Building">Kingdom Turn Sequence</a>.
