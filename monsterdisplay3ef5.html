Special Abilities

Decapitating Strike (Ex) On an attack roll of a natural 20 (followed by a successful roll to confirm the critical hit) with its bite attack, a camulatz severs its opponent's head (if the opponent has one). Most creatures die when their heads are cut off. This ability functions as the vorpal weapon special ability.

Hypnotic Display (Su) As a full-round action, a camulatz may cause its coat of feathers to change colors, shifting through a mesmerizing pattern that lures creatures to the camulatz's side. All creatures who can see the camulatz (even other camulatz) must succeed on a DC 18 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same camulatz's hypnotic display for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the hypnotic display moves toward the camulatz using the most direct means available. If this path leads the victim into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim that is within 5 feet of the camulatz simply stands and offers no resistance to the camulatz's attacks. This effect lasts for 1d6 rounds. Sightless creatures are not affected. This is a mind-affecting pattern effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Sound Mimicry (Ex) A camulatz can perfectly imitate certain sounds or the speech of any creature it has heard, though this ability does not allow it to speak or to understand languages it does not know. The listener must make a Sense Motive check opposed by the camulatz's Bluff check to recognize the mimicry, although if the listener isn't familiar with the person or the type of creatures mimicked, it takes a -8 penalty on its Sense Motive check. The camulatz has a +8 racial bonus on its Bluff check to mimic speech or sounds that it has listened to for at least 10 minutes. It cannot duplicate the effects of magical abilities (such as bardic performance or a harpy's captivating song), though it may be able to mimic the sound of those abilities.

Description

Hidden within the high canopy overlooking the jungle floor dwells a race of enormous, vicious, and vibrantly colored birds known as camulatz. Possessing a cruel intelligence, camulatz are vile headhunters and aggressive demon-worshipers, preying on all sentient creatures as sacrifices to their chosen demon lord: Pazuzu, King of the Wind Demons. Camulatz revel in trickery and bloodshed, luring victims into ambushes where the camulatz can indulge their bloodlust and take their victims' heads as grisly trophies.

The iridescent coloration of a camulatz's feathers assists in mesmerizing unfortunate souls, luring them to the killing ground below the brightly colored bird's aerie. Camulatz also have a special affinity for sounds, naturally mimicking voices and animal noises, while perfecting the magical ability to displace such sounds, making them seem to emanate from other creatures or objects. Camulatz delight in using both their magical ventriloquism and their beautiful plumage to mislead and separate victims before surprising them with diving attacks from above.

All camulatz possess sharp talons on their feet, capable of rending the most heavily armored foes, but they rely on their cruelly curved beaks to decapitate their victims. The vivid patterns of a camulatz's feathers also provide some protection to the birds, forming a magical field of clashing colors that can deflect ranged attacks.

A mature camulatz is just over 14 feet in length from its beak to the ends of its tail feathers, but weighs only 300 pounds because of its lightweight bone structure. Each individual camulatz bears its own unique feather coloration, which it can consciously manipulate in set patterns to produce its hypnotic display.
