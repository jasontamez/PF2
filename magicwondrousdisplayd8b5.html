Description

Only Large or larger creatures can wear these sturdy leather gauntlets. If the wearer has the rock catching ability (Bestiary 303), the Reflex DC to catch rocks is reduced by 5 while she's wearing the gauntlets. Furthermore, the wearer can attempt to catch a thrown rock of which she's unaware, but doesn't benefit from the DC reduction granted by the primary function of the gauntlets. If the wearer does not have the rock catching ability, these gauntlets bestow that ability on the wearer instead of their normal effects.
