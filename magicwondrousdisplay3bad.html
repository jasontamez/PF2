Description

This giant pearl is carved with entwined flying dragons and strung on a fine silver chain; the pearl changes size according to the size of the wearer so that its diameter is no greater than the wearer's thumb. Once per day, the wearer can breathe a cone of searing flame that functions as burning hands, except it deals electricity damage instead of fire.

If the dragon god Apsu is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can use eagle's splendor. On command, the orb glows with a light spell or darkens again.
