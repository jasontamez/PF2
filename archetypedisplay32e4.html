Not content with perfecting her body with natural methods, a mutagenic mauler resorts to alchemy to unlock the primal beast within.

Mutagen (Su):  At 1st level, a mutagenic mauler discovers how to create a mutagen that she can imbibe in order to heighten her physical prowess, though at the cost of her personality. This functions as an <a href="classdisplayd2f1.html?ItemName=Alchemist">alchemist's mutagen</a> and uses the brawler's class level as her alchemist level for this ability (alchemist levels stack with brawler levels for determining the effect of this ability). A mutagenic mauler counts as an alchemist for the purpose of imbibing a mutagen prepared by someone else.

At 6th level, a mutagenic mauler gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when she attacks in melee while in her mutagenic form. This bonus increases to +3 at 11th level, and to +4 at 16th level. At 10th level, a mutagenic mauler learns one of the following <a href="_alchemistdiscoveries.html">alchemist discoveries</a>: feral mutagen or infuse mutagen, preserve organs, spontaneous healing. At 12th level, the mutagenic mauler learns the greater mutagen discovery.

This ability replaces martial flexibility.

Beastmorph (Su):  Starting at 4th level, a mutagenic mauler gains additional abilities when using her mutagen. At 4th level, she gains low-light vision and a +10 enhancement bonus to her base speed. At 9th level, she gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet and a climb speed of 15 feet. At 13th level, the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +15 feet and she gains the scent ability within 30 feet. At 18th level, her climb speed increases to 30 feet, and the enhancement bonus to her base speed increases to +20 feet. This ability replaces AC bonus.
