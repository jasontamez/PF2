Description

Fashioned from a scrap of a blind beggar's clothing, a blind
man's fold is often used by explorers who must traverse
caves inhabited by invisible creatures, or those drawn to
sources of light. A blind man's fold fully obscures normal
vision while worn, but grants the effects of the Improved
Blind-Fight feat (Advanced Player's Guide 162). Creatures
which are unable to see normally gain no benefit from
wearing a blind man's fold.
