Description

This heavy canvas sack can carry adventuring gear and other supplies. It holds 4 cubic feet of goods and has a leather thong that allows it to be tied shut. The sack is laced with scents that animals find odious, and it is dyed in similarly repellant colors. Creatures with the animal creature type and an Intelligence ability score of 2 or lower avoid contact with an animal-repellant sack and won't tamper with its contents unless they're magically compelled, ordered by a handler, or starving.
