Description

This ornate stone tablet measures 10 inches on each side and is approximately 1 inch thick. It can store up to 3 levels of spells, per a minor ring of spell storing, except each spell retains the caster level at which it is cast into the tablet. When a spell is stored in the tablet, writing appears on the stone as if carved onto the surface. While holding the tablet, a user can decipher and activate spells from it exactly as though it were a scroll-the user must meet the requirements for activating a spell from a scroll, and a scroll mishap might occur if her caster level is lower than that of the spell.
