The noble crusader battles the forces of chaos, usually at the behest of a local monarch.

Oriedesme Eisbrin

Oriedesme is a crusader for law against the forces of chaos. As a minor noble, she frequently allies with other members of the nobility, who call her "Esme the Peacemaker." She considers it her duty to eliminate dangerous monsters and even peasant uprisings that threaten to turn bloody. She serves a good and just goddess and refuses to participate in evil acts such as terrorizing villagers, but frowns on acts of anarchy that risk plunging an area into war. She believes nobles are chosen by the gods to rule over others for the benefit of all, even if this means fewer freedoms for commoners. She is painfully honest, and reluctant to work with any noble who shirks responsibilities or abuses power.

Combat Encounters: Esme works well alone or in a leadership role. She might be an ally of a powerful character, using her neutrality to get things done for a good employer or moderating a nearly evil one.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Esme might ask for assistance in dealing with an undead or fiendish threat beyond her capabilities. She could serve as an important intermediary with the local nobility, especially if the PCs have preexisting conflicts with the nobles. Esme could also be cynically close to losing her faith, giving the PCs the opportunity to save her before she falls from grace.
