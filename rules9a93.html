If an army is destroyed and the commander is an NPC, the commander is killed (01-20), captured (21-70), or escapes (71-00). An army of mindless creatures kills all captured NPC commanders. You may ransom a captured commander by paying BP equal to the commander's army's Consumption (if captured by another kingdom, this goes to that kingdom's Treasury). A commander with a history of losing battles, being captured, and being ransomed gains an unlucky reputation among your troops and reduces the Morale of any army under her by 1.

If you are the commander and your army is destroyed, the GM should present you with an opportunity to escape with serious injuries (at 25% hp or lower), otherwise you are captured and held for ransom. The other PCs may pay BP, gold, or other treasures to ransom you, or the GM may allow the other PCs to have an adventure where they attempt to rescue you instead of simply buying your freedom.
