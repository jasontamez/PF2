Description

This coin-sized black disk is engraved with a spiral on one side and a whippoorwill on the other. When the bearer of the disk succeeds at a Constitution check to stabilize, the disk heals the wearer, restoring her to 1 hit point regardless of her previous hit point total. The disk then crumbles to dust. Should a character have multiple lady's mercies, only one disk triggers at a time.
