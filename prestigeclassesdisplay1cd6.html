After centuries of raiding and pillaging throughout Avistan, the Ulfen have earned their reputation for ferocity and fearlessness. Though seemingly at odds with this perception of barbarism, Ulfen are also known for their staunch loyalty, strong sense of honor, and unyielding resolve. The combination of these reputations is in large part why they have become desired as bodyguards throughout the region. Nowhere is this practice more pronounced than in Taldor, where Ulfen have become ensconced in the Taldan tradition and adopted as the elite bodyguards of Grand Prince Stavian III himself. Ulfen Guards, as outsiders, are generally thought to have no ulterior motives or secret loyalty to other Taldan families or political organizations; their honor keeps them loyal to the crown. An Ulfen Guard is required to be of at least half- Ulfen descent, with one or both parents hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Non-Ulfen may serve the organization in a support capacity, but may not be Ulfen Guards themselves. While the Ulfen Guards are officially Stavian III's personal bodyguards, he often has them perform other tasks that take them all over the Inner Sea region, protecting his interests as well as his person, or operating secretly under the auspices of traveling Ulfen merchants, raiding seafarers, or unaffiliated mercenaries, all the while serving the Taldan crown.

The following are class features of the Ulfen Guard prestige class.

Chosen Ally (Ex): At 1st level, when entering a rage, an Ulfen Guard can choose an ally to protect as a free action. The Ulfen Guard must make this choice when beginning her rage and cannot change her designated ally while raging. Whenever the Ulfen Guard is adjacent to her chosen ally, she can choose to take a -1 penalty to her AC to grant her ally a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th and 10th level.

Guard Dedications: At 1st level, and at every 2 levels thereafter, an Ulfen Guard chooses a guard dedication from the list below. An Ulfen Guard cannot choose a guard dedication more than once unless the dedication specifies otherwise.

Alert Guardian (Ex): An Ulfen Guard with this dedication can enter a rage as an immediate action, and can do so even when flat-footed or during a surprise round in which she cannot otherwise act.

Clothed in Civilization (Ex): The Ulfen Guard gains proficiency in heavy armor. At 5th level, if the Ulfen Guard has the barbarian fast movement ability, she can use her fast movement ability while wearing heavy armor. This does not negate the penalties to movement imposed by the armor itself.

Curiosity (Ex): The Ulfen Guard's peculiar nature makes her an object of intrigue. Civilized people are fascinated by the "tamed" barbarian, while more barbaric cultures are fascinated by her choice to turn her back on her heritage. The Ulfen Guard gains a bonus equal to her class level on Diplomacy checks.

Deflect Arrows (Ex): The Ulfen Guard gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. If she is adjacent to her chosen ally, she can use this ability to deflect an arrow targeting her chosen ally. The Ulfen Guard does not need to meet the prerequisites for this bonus feat.

Formal Training (Ex): When selecting this dedication, the Ulfen Guard gains a bonus feat. She must select this feat from the list of fighter bonus feats. Additionally, the Ulfen Guard adds her level to any levels of fighter she has for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites for feats (if she has no fighter levels, treat her Ulfen guard levels as fighter levels). The Ulfen Guard must be at least 3rd level to select this dedication.

Greater Rage (Ex): The Ulfen Guard gains greater rage; this works as the barbarian ability of the same name. The Ulfen Guard must be at least 7th level to select this dedication.

Rage Power (Ex): The Ulfen Guard can select a barbarian rage power for which she qualifies, adding her Ulfen Guard level to her barbarian level to determine access. This guard dedication can be chosen up to three times.

Teamwork (Ex): Each time she begins her rage, the Ulfen Guard can select a teamwork feat (Advanced Players Guide 150) that her chosen ally possesses; this must be a teamwork feat for which the Ulfen Guard otherwise qualifies. For the duration of her rage, the Ulfen Guard gains the benefits of that feat. This guard dedication can be chosen multiple times; each additional time allows the Ulfen Guard to select an additional teamwork feat at the start of her rage, thus granting her the use of more than one teamwork feat simultaneously.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): The Ulfen Guard gains uncanny dodge, as the barbarian class feature of the same name. If the guard already has uncanny dodge from another source (or a previous instance of this dedication), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge. If she already has improved uncanny dodge, taking this dedication grants the effects of improved uncanny dodge to her chosen ally as long as the guard is adjacent to the ally. Use the guard's class level plus her barbarian levels to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank either character. This guard dedication can be chosen up to three times.

Rage (Ex): An Ulfen Guard is trained to harness her brutish nature while in combat in the defense of her charge. This works as the barbarian ability of the same name. An Ulfen Guard's class levels stack with any other classes granting this ability for determining the effects of rage powers and the number of rounds per day the guard can rage.

Guarded Thoughts (Ex): At 2nd level, if the Ulfen Guard fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, she immediately receives an additional save with a +5 circumstance bonus if the effect would compel her to attack her chosen ally. The guard can use this ability any number of times, but only once per effect.

Adaptable Guardian (Ex): At 4th level, the Ulfen Guard can change her chosen ally during a rage as a move action. At 8th level, the Ulfen Guard can change her chosen ally as a swift action.

Tight Follower (Ex): At 6th level, if the Ulfen Guard is within 10 feet of her chosen ally and the ally moves more than 10 feet away from her, the Ulfen Guard can move up to her speed as an immediate action so long as she ends the movement within 10 feet of her chosen ally.

Reactive Strike (Ex): At 8th level, an Ulfen Guard can make an attack of opportunity against an enemy that moves adjacent to or attacks the Ulfen Guard's chosen ally. The Ulfen Guard cannot make a reactive strike against a creature she has already made an attack of opportunity against during the round.

Unbreakable Defender (Ex): At 10th level, as long as she is within 10 feet of her chosen ally, the Ulfen Guard gains the benefits of the Die Hard feat and no longer becomes fatigued when she ends her rage.
