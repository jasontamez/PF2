Boggards resemble anthropomorphic frogs or toads, complete with webbed hands and feet, large eyes, and overly wide mouths. These creatures make their homes near large rivers or deep in marshes. There they make small villages composed of mud mounds on the banks. Boggards start out life as tadpoles in breeding ponds, eventually growing to a length of 3 feet before sprouting arms and legs and becoming capable of terrestrial living. Acceptance into the clan then depends on the young boggard's successful hunt to kill a sentient humanoid. Those who fail are exiled from the clan. As boggards age, they continue to grow and lose their coloration. Exceptionally old boggards bear completely white skin covering massive corpulent bodies. Some of these boggards rank among the caste of priest-kings and enjoy a life of grotesque pleasures ruling their clans.

Though often hunched over, boggards stand 5 feet tall and weigh close to 200 pounds. These creatures live for 50 years, though the harsh swamps and infighting usually cut these years short.

Boggard Alternate Racial Traits



Replaces Acrobatics (to jump) Racial Bonus

Estivation
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 8</a>
Not all marshes are wet year-round, and some boggards have adapted to life in seasonal swamps where hot, arid conditions are common. A boggard with this racial trait can spend 1 hour burying herself in wet or soft earth and entering a state of suspended animation for an indefinite amount of time. While estivating, a boggard doesn't need to drink or eat, but takes a penalty on Perception checks as if sleeping. Ending this dormant state is a full-round action. This racial trait replaces a boggard's racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump.


Replaces Nothing

Priest-King
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 8</a>
Boggards raised on a diet of blue dragonfly pulp sometimes develop into priest-kings. These boggards have only a +2 natural armor bonus but don't take the common boggard's -2 racial penalty to Dexterity and Intelligence. In addition, priest-kings receive a +4 racial bonus to Wisdom and gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day-fog cloud, jump, summon swarm. The caster level for these effects is equal to the boggard's Hit Dice. This racial trait doesn't replace any of a boggard's other features, but it's extremely rare and available only at the GM's discretion.


Replaces Swim Speed

Leaper

Boggards in some regions have legs better suited to explosive movement on land rather than swift propulsion underwater. Boggards with this trait are always considered to have a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump, and their swim speeds are reduced by 15 feet.


Boggard Favored Class Options

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, Boggards have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.

The following options are available to all Boggards who have the listed favored class.

Barbarian (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 8</a>): Add 1 on the barbarian's Acrobatics checks to jump.
Bard (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 8</a>): Reduce the amount of time the bard must wait before using his terrifying croak ability by 5 minutes (minimum 5 minutes).
Fighter (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 8</a>): Increase the hit points of the fighter's tongue by 1 and add 1/2 on all opposed Strength checks to prevent a creature from detaching the fighter's tongue.
Ranger (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9926?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Monster-Codex">Monster Codex pg. 8</a>): Add 1/4 to a single existing favored terrain bonus (maximum +2 per favored terrain).
