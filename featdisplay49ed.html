No one is prepared for how hard you strike until they see it firsthand.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1, sneak attack class feature.

Benefit:  If you use Power Attack with the first melee attack you make during a surprise round, you can sneak attack even if you are not flanking your target and it's not denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.
