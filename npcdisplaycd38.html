Hal Five-Coins

Hal is an arrogant but skilled thief whose nickname comes from his habit of juggling gold coins. Many guilds have a price on his head.

Combat Encounters: Hal might be found while rigging an accident, stealing, or planting evidence.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Because he's willing to work for anyone, Hal might end up on the same side as the PCs.
