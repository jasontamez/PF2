Your animal companion is descended from creatures from one of the Elemental Planes.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, animal companion or mount class feature.

Benefit: You can take a genie-touched creature as an animal companion. This animal companion functions as a horse companion, with the adjustments that follow. When you choose your genie-touched companion, you must select your companion's breed: istaheq, misayyah, tuanu, or zefaheen. Your choice determines the type of energy resistance your companion gains, as well as the three additional abilities your companion acquires as you advance in level.
