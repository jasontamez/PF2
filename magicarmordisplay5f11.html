Description

If a spellrending shield successfully protects its wearer from a spell effect, the shield stores the spell's energy and glows as bright as a torch for 1 round per level of the spell negated. If the wearer of the spellrending shield successfully performs a shield bash during this time, the spell's energy is discharged and the wearer gains a bonus on attack and damage rolls for the shield bash equal to the level of the absorbed spell effect. Only a shield with a spell resistance special ability can have the spellrending special ability.
