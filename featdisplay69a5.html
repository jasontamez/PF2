Nature's Weapons

You can make a weapon out of nearly anything that can be found in the wild.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayf03d.html?ItemName=Catch%20Off-Guard">Catch Off-Guard</a>; base attack bonus +2; Knowledge (nature) or Survival 2 ranks.

Benefit: You can turn nearly anything you might find in the wilderness into an improvised melee weapon. This improvised melee weapon is one-handed and deals 1d6 points of damage for Medium creatures and 1d4 for Small creatures. Depending on the weapon, it deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (at the GM's discretion). Grabbing an object to use as a weapon is the same action as drawing a weapon. The weapon must be of a material that is naturally occurring in that terrain.
