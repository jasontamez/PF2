Description

Once its fuse has been lit, this hoop-shaped firework emits colorful sparks from a series of outward-angled wooden tubes. It can then be rolled along the ground or thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 30 feet. One round after being lit, a fire wheel firework explodes in a spectacular 5-foottall cylindrical blast with a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area take 3d6 points of fire damage and are blinded for 1 minute (Reflex DC 16 halves damage, negates blindness).
