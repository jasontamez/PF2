Your unarmed fighting style emulates the strength and ferocity of a tiger.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +3 or monk level 3rd.

Benefit:  While using this style, you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip maneuvers. You can also deal slashing damage with your unarmed strikes. Whenever you score a critical hit with your slashing unarmed strike, your opponent also takes 1d4 points of bleed damage at the start of his next two turns.

Normal:  Unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage.

When you score a critical hit with your slashing unarmed strike, you can spend 2 stamina points to make the bleed damage last until the target is healed either with a Heal check or magical healing (instead of lasting only 2 turns).
