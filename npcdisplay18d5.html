A rider of the steppe works individually or in a group to bring safety and law to the wild and arid flatlands, often protecting caravans and traveling dignitaries.

Leisair Truemark

Leisair traveled to the steppes in search of peace and tranquility. Instead, she found a place where raiders hunted caravans with impunity, and she decided that this place needed her far more than her homeland. She travels the wastes, often latching on to caravans as a scout.

Combat Encounters: An encounter with Leisair typically begins with warning shots. She is not opposed to opening a dialogue with a group, but even then she shouts from far away rather than risk approaching strangers.

Roleplaying Suggestions: To her friends and the people she protects, Leisair is both friendly and kind, but if she has any reason to suspect the intentions of unknown folks, she can be cold and haughty.
