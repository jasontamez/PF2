Description

Before it is used, this elegant drinking vessel must be filled with water, wine, or another ceremonial liquid appropriate to the faith. Activating the chalice charges the liquid with channeled energy; any member of the faith who drinks the entire contents of the chalice (as if drinking a potion) recovers hit points or takes damage as if the cleric had used her channel energy on him (including all feats and abilities that affect the DC and damage). The liquid in the chalice remains charged until consumed, spilled, or 24 hours pass; some chalices include a cover to prevent spillage.
