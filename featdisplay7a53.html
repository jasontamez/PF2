Beast Speaker - Feats







Beast Speaker

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 21</a>
You have trained in the ways that the beast speakers of the Tekritani once used to ally themselves with magical beasts.

Prerequisites: Handle Animal 7 ranks, animal companion with effective druid level 7.

Benefit: You can select a creature from the list of magical beasts to serve as your animal companion. You acquire and advance this beast companion in the same way as an animal companion detailed in the class feature that grants you access to your animal companion. You can also dismiss the creature, as dictated by your class feature.

You must meet additional prerequisites to select a companion with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, as described in each creature's entry.



Beast Companion Choices

The following creatures can be chosen as beast companions by a character with the Beast Speaker feat. Their entries and advancement are the same as for animal companions, with two exceptions. First, creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher have one or more additional prerequisites the character must meet to select the companion. Second, each beast companion has a mastery ability that it can use only if the character it is bonded to has the <a href="featdisplayea71.html?ItemName=Beast%20Speaker%20Mastery">Beast Speaker Mastery</a> feat. The minimum level to gain this ability is listed in parentheses. The save DC for any of a beast companion's special abilities is 10 + half the beast companion's HD + the beast companion's Constitution modifier.
