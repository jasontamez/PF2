Your skillful movements prevent foes from disrupting your spells.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay0835.html?ItemName=Combat%20Casting">Combat Casting</a>, <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Acrobatics).</a>

Benefit: When you succeed at an Acrobatics check to move through a threatened square without provoking attacks of opportunity or to move through an enemy's space, creatures denied attacks of opportunity by your Acrobatics check also cannot make attacks of opportunity against you when you cast spells for the remainder of your turn.

Normal: Casting a spell within an enemy's reach provokes attacks of opportunity even after you succeed at an Acrobatics check to move through a threatened square.
