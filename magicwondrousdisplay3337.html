Description

These high-soled blue boots provide a great deal of comfort and
arch support while also making the wearer appear a little bit
taller than normal. The boot's wearer always takes the minimum
possible damage from falls (as if the GM had rolled a 1 on each
die of damage incurred by the fall) and at the end of a fall always
lands on his feet.
