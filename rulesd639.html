Running a kingdom is more fun if all the players are involved and each is responsible for making some of the kingdom checks. Who makes each roll depends on the players in your group and what roles they want to play. Some players may not want to make any of these rolls. You may want to start with the following die roll responsibilities and modify them to suit your kingdom and the other players. Anything marked as an optional rule is described in the <a href="rules1e8a.html?Name=Optional%20Kingdom%20Rules&amp;Category=Kingdoms%20and%20War">optional kingdom-building rules</a>.
