Description

A backpack of this sort appears to
be well made, well used, and quite
ordinary. It has two side pouches,
each of which appears large enough
to hold about a quart of material.
In fact, each is like a bag of holding
and can actually hold material of as
much as 2 cubic feet in volume or
20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can
contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so
filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.


While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even
greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific
item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and
fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains.
Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action,
but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving
a stored item usually does.
