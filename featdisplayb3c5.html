You instinctively react to interfere with foes that attack your allies or innocents.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, worshiper of Kurgess.

Benefit:  Whenever an opponent you threaten makes an attack against a helpless, prone, or stunned ally or any attack against a noncombatant, that opponent provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If your attack of opportunity hits your foe, she takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll that provoked this attack of opportunity.
