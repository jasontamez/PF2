Powered armor represents the pinnacle of personal armor-a suit crafted of multiple skymetals and other materials designed to augment the wearer in numerous ways. The armor actually boosts land speed when worn, granting a +10 foot enhancement bonus to the wearer's speed. While worn, powered armor also grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity. Powered armor protects against energy and the environment as if it were a spacesuit (see page 32). Powered armor has hardness 20 and 300 hit points. Powered armor is fitted with numerous small booster jets that grant the wearer a fly speed of 60 feet (with average maneuverability) in areas of no gravity and 20 feet (with poor maneuverability) in gravity.

As a standard action, the wearer may activate the armor's self-repair system. The armor consumes a single charge and repairs 2d6 points of damage. Only 1 charge can be consumed per turn for this effect.

In addition, the following technological wonders are integrated into a suit of powered armor-each of these devices drains power from the suit's charges as appropriate when they are activated and used. <ul><li>Camera (see page 40) in the helmet.</li><li>Commset (see page 42) in the helmet.</li><li>Fire extinguisher (see page 44) mounted on the left wrist.</li><li>Flashlight (see page 45) mounted on the helmet.</li><li>Gloves that can function as grippers (see page 47).</li><li>Laser pistol (see page 25) mounted on the right forearm that leaves the hand free. Firing this laser pistol is always considered an off-hand attack, and the number of times it can be fired cannot be increased by feats like Improved Two Weapon Fighting.</li><li>Magboots (see page 49).</li><li>Three medlances (see page 49). Each medlance can be loaded with a single potion or pharmaceutical; activating an integrated medlance is an immediate action.</li><li>Power receiver (see page 51).</li><li>Prismatic force field (see page 45) located on hips; activating this force field is a swift action.</li><li>Radiation detector (see page 51) on the right wrist.</li><li>Custom veemods (see page 53) in the visor grant a +10 bonus on Perception checks, low light vision, darkvision up to 120 feet, and all-around vision.</li></ul> Rumors persist of variant forms of powered armor, including suits sized for giants or that can function as vehicles for multiple creatures.
