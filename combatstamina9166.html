You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. When you successfully disarm a foe, you can spend 5 stamina points to select where the weapon lands by choosing a square within 15 feet of the disarmed foe. If you choose a square in your space and have at least one hand free, you can grab the weapon as part of the disarm attempt.
