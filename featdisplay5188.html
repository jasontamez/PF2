The stomach-churning terror of your smothering attack leaves creatures sick and weakened.

Prerequisites: Engulf or smother universal monster ability.

Benefit: When you successfully engulf or smother an opponent, or successfully maintain a grapple combat maneuver on an engulfed or smothered opponent, that opponent must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or become shaken for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
