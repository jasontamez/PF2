Description

An undead wearing this golden mask is treated as both an undead and a creature of the type it was before becoming undead (including any associated subtypes) for the purposes of determining its eligibility as a target of illusion and transmutation spells (such as alter self or disguise self). A corpse wearing the mask gains the effects of gentle repose and sanctify corpse. A living creature wearing the mask gains no effects.
