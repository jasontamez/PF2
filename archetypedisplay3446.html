Ambusher

Ambushers sneak up on unsuspecting prey, pouncing on targets when they least expect it.

Camouflage (Ex): An ambusher gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks in its natural environment (if this is unclear, use the environment in its Bestiary entry). At 15th level, an ambusher can use the Stealth skill to hide in its natural environment, even if the environment doesn't grant cover or concealment.

This replaces share spells and improved evasion.

Cunning Ambusher (Ex): At 3rd level, an ambusher gains uncanny dodge. At 6th level, an ambusher gains a +2 racial bonus on initiative checks, and during the surprise round, opponents are always considered flat-footed against the ambusher's attacks, even if they have already acted. At 9th level, an ambusher gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls during a surprise round.

This replaces evasion, devotion, and Multiattack.
