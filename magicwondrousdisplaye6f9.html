Description

This simple pair of leather shooting bracers are designed to
protect the wearer's wrist from being snapped by bowstrings.
They appear similar to a set of bracers of archery, but a wearer
notices the difference as soon as she dons them.


The wearer of these bracers gains damage reduction 5/
magic against ranged weapons, as well as a +1 deflection
bonus against ranged attacks. In addition, once per day, as
a swift action, the wearer can grant herself a +20 insight
bonus on her next ranged attack roll before the end of her
next turn.
