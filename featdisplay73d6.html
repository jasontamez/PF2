By tearing away an opponent's magical defenses, you leave your enemy vulnerable, making it difficult for him to resist your spells.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 5 ranks.

Benefit:  If you successfully dispel an ongoing magical effect on an opponent, that opponent takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against your spells until the end of your next turn.
