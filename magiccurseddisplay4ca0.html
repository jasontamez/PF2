Description

This gray magical cloak seems to be a protective cloak, but
when it is donned, the wearer must succeed at a DC 20
Fortitude save or be instantly petrified. If the initial saving
throw succeeds, the creature wearing the cloak must make
further checks at the start of each of its turns. On any failed
saving throw the creature becomes petrified. A remove curse or stone to flesh transforms the wearer back, at least long
enough for someone to take the cloak off the wearer.
