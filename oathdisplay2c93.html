Oath against Undeath

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 61</a>
A paladin with this oath vows to restore the natural state of death to any animate corpse she encounters, and destroy the undead energy in the process. While a few paladins who take this oath recognize that not all undead are evil, others are quite willing to purge neutral and good undead along with all the evil ones.

Detect Undead (Su):  This ability works like the standard paladin ability to detect evil, except as detect undead instead of detect evil. This ability replaces detect evil.

Ghost Touch Aura (Su):  At 3rd level, the paladin's armor is treated as if it had the ghost touch armor property. This does not affect the cost or effect of any other abilities of the armor. At 9th level, this ability also applies to the paladin's shield. This ability replaces the paladin's 3rd-level and 9th-level mercies.

Aura of Life (Su):  At 8th level, the paladin gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against attacks that grant negative levels and saves to overcome negative levels. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +2 morale bonus on these saves.

This ability functions only while the paladin is conscious, not if she is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of resolve.

Superior Channeler (Su):  At 11th level, a paladin can channel positive energy to harm undead by expending a single usage of her lay on hands ability instead of two. This ability replaces aura of justice.

Code of Conduct:  Destroy all undead. Put to rest the poor souls turned against their will. Prevent the taint of undeath from spreading to the newly dead, blessing or burning the corpses as necessary.

Oath Spells:  1st-sanctify corpse; 2nd-darkvision; 3rd-searing light; 4th-halt undead.
