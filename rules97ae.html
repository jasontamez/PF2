Sketch in major woodlands or jungles, placing them along coastlines and in lowlands, perhaps up to the edges of your highest elevations in places. Vegetation near a large water source like a delta often forms a marshland or swamp. Don't go too overboard with these regions, though! Remember that areas you don't turn into woodlands or swamps can be hilly regions, plains, steppes, badlands, or other relatively clear terrains. Deserts are a special case-place them in areas where there are few rivers (it's okay to have one or two) and where there's a mountain range to block the path of precipitation-this area is known as a "rain shadow."
