Description

This foot-long brass funnel amplifies sounds entering through the broad end for anyone listening at the narrow end. The listener gains a +2 circumstance bonus on sound-based Perception checks but must use one hand to hold the trumpet to the ear in order to gain the benefit. A masterwork ear trumpet's exquisite acoustic properties grant the listener a +4 circumstance bonus instead.
