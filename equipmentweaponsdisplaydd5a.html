Description

A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length and covered in wicked barbs. Some have metal hoops to use as handgrips. You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.
