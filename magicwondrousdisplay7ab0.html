Description

This silky red dust is pleasantly warm to the touch. When sprinkled on a partially decomposed corpse or skeleton, it causes the dead flesh and bones to mend and reform, allowing the corpse to be identified or raised as if it were killed recently (effectively restarting the day count that limits raise dead). If more than half of the bones are missing or the subject has been dead for more than 100 years, the dust has no effect. One vial contains enough restoration dust to restore a single Medium or smaller corpse. Larger corpses can be restored by using multiple vials (two for Large creatures, four for Huge, eight for Gargantuan, and 16 for Colossal).
