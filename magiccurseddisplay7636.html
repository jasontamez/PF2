Description

This unguent appears at first to be unguent of timelessness.
When it touches the skin of a living creature or matter that was
once alive, however, it accelerates the aging of that creature
or item. Living creatures that touch the unguent age by 30
years. Once living matter'such as wood, paper, or a dead
body-crumbles to dust and is destroyed. One flask contains
enough unguent to affect eight Medium or smaller creatures
or objects. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects and a Huge creature or object counts as
four Medium creatures or objects.
