Draconic companions bear a faint trace of dragon blood that grants them special abilities.

Draconic Skills: Draconic companions treat Intimidate as a class skill.

Not Quite Animal: The DC to use Handle Animal on a draconic companion is 5 higher, as if it were a nonanimal with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2.

Draconic Sight (Ex): A draconic companion gains lowlight vision and darkvision to a range of 60 feet.

This replaces share spells.

Draconic Resistance (Ex): At 3rd level, choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire, based on the draconic companion's draconic ancestor. The draconic companion gains resistance 5 against the chosen energy type, as well as a +2 racial bonus on saves against paralysis and sleep.

This replaces evasion.

Improved Draconic Resistance (Ex): At 6th level, a draconic companion becomes immune to paralysis and sleep, and its energy resistance increases to 10. At 15th level, its energy resistance increases to 20.

This replaces devotion.

Breath Weapon (Ex): At 9th level, a draconic companion gains a breath weapon, usable once per day, that deals 1d6 points of damage per Hit Dice of the energy type matching its draconic resistance in either a 30-foot cone or a 60-foot line (chosen when the draconic companion gains this ability). At 15th level, it can use the breath weapon three times per day, but it must wait 1d4 rounds between uses. Targets of this breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the draconic companion's Hit Dice + the draconic companion's Constitution modifier) for half damage.

This replaces Multiattack and improved evasion.
