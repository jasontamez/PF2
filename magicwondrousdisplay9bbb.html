Description

When the wearer first sees an illusion effect with the figment
subschool with a visual element, and that figment allows a
saving throw, she can immediately make any allowed saving
throw to realize the image is illusory instead of waiting
to interact with it. This has no effect on illusions of other
subschools or on illusions that do not normally allow a saving
throw. If the wearer fails to disbelieve the illusion and later
interacts with it in such a way as to qualify normally for a
saving throw to disbelieve, she gains a +4 competence bonus
on this saving throw.
