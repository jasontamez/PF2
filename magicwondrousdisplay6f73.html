Description

This item is typically fashioned of brass or
bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special
seals. Periodically, a thin stream of bittersmelling
smoke issues from the bottle's
top. The bottle can be opened once per
day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned
within issues from the bottle instantly amid
a cloud of noxious smoke. There is a 10%
chance (01-10 on d%) that the efreeti is
insane and attacks immediately upon being
released. There is also a 10% chance (91-100) that the efreeti
of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, afterward the
efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical.
The other 80% of the time (11-90), the inhabitant of the bottle
loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until
the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the
bottle is opened for that day's effect.
