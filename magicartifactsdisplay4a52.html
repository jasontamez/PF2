Description

Holy to the church of Pharasma, this gold-plated +3 undead bane heavy mace was the symbol of office for the Bishop of Caliphas until Prince Adamondais Virholt lost it in battle against the Whispering Tyrant. A character with the ability to channel positive energy gains the Channel Smite feat while wielding Raven's Head, if she does not already possess the feat. In the hands of a cleric of Pharasma, Raven's Head gains the disruption weapon special ability, and the wielder can use the Channel Smite feat as if she were a cleric of four levels higher (+2 on the DC and +2d6 damage) and an extra three times per day.

Destruction

If successfully used as a component in the creation of a lich or other undead, Raven's Head's power is broken forever.
