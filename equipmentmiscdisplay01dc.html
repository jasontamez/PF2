Description

This packet filled with spikey-edged leaves has a pungent scent almost strong enough to make your eyes water. While you chew the leaves, you ignore the effects of fatigue. The leaves last for 6 rounds, at which point only a wad of pulp remains. When the effect of rager's aid wears off, you are exhausted instead.
