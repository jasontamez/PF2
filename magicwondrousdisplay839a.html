Description

A brazen head is an object sacred to the cult of Baphomet. Most brazen heads appear to be the head of a minotaur, but others in the shape of humans, animals, or multi-faced demons exist.

When mounted on a wall in an area sacred to Baphomet, the brazen head constantly breathes out invisible vapors that fill a 60-foot spread. Any evil creature in this area gains the benefit of a bless spell.

When in the area of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Baphomet, a brazen head can be used once per month to perform an augury. Rumors exist of more powerful brazen heads capable of casting divination or even commune.
