Dhampir Alternate Racial Trait

Replaces Manipulative

Vampire Hunter
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 215</a>
Some dhampirs bear a deep hatred for their undead progenitors and their kin that can never be fully quenched. They gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls against vampires. This racial trait replaces manipulative.

Vampiric Empathy
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 97</a>
Though dhampirs often relate poorly to humanoids, some share an affinity with baser creatures. These dhampirs gain the ability to communicate with bats, rats, and wolves as if under the effects of a speak with animals spell (caster level equal to 1/2 the dhampir's Hit Dice). In addition, they gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks when dealing with these animals. Whenever these dhampirs initiate an exchange, animals begin with a starting attitude of indifferent. This is a supernatural ability. This racial trait replaces manipulative.


Replaces Spell-Like Ability

Dayborn
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 97</a>
A few fortunate dhampirs were born during the day under the blessings of priests, and their blood has weaker ties to their undead bloodline than others of their kind. Such dhampirs are unhindered by daylight and lose the light sensitivity racial trait. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Fangs
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 97</a>
On occasion, a dhampir may inherit his father's lengthy canines. Whenever the dhampir makes a grapple combat maneuver check to damage an opponent, he can choose to bite his opponent, dealing 1d3 points of damage as if using a natural bite attack. As a standard action, the dhampir can bite a creature that is bound, helpless, paralyzed, or similarly unable to defend itself. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.

Heir to Undying Nobility
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 215</a>
Descended from undead nobility, perhaps from Geb, Nidal, or Ustalav, some dhampirs inherit a bit of their ancestors' ability to control living beings. They can use command and charm person each once per day. This racial trait replaces the spell-like ability racial trait.
