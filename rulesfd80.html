This is another way of saying "play to the PCs" strengths,- but is worth reiterating. Part of the fun of playing is leveling a character and gaining new abilities. If you create encounters that circumvent the PCs' newest abilities, it takes away some of the fun of the game because it's like they didn't gain all the benefits of their level. For example, if the PC wizard just reached level 5 and learned the <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a> spell, you may be tempted to throw some fire-resistant or fire-immune encounters at the PCs to compensate for this ability-which makes the 5th-level wizard feel like a 4th-level wizard. However, thousands of RPG campaigns have survived PCs who can cast <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>; it's better for a GM to embrace the new ability than fear it. Give the wizard a cluster of minions to blast so he feels powerful-or set up an encounter where he has to choose between blasting a bunch of minions or using the spell on just the boss.

Some monsters are designed to be more challenging to certain character classes. Golems are immune to almost all magic, some outsiders have very high damage reduction, oozes are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks, and so on. If the PCs end up facing these kinds of creatures over and over again (especially in a short amount of time), the stymied players can easily get frustrated-after the third encounter with stone golems, the sorcerer and wizard are likely to give up and want to stop playing. If you're going to use a lot of these creatures (say, in a themed dungeon), you have two options to prevent player frustration.

Give the Character a Tool: There are dozens of limited-use items in the game, plus consumables like potions and scrolls. If you know one PC is going to have a problem with an upcoming encounter, drop a helpful item into an earlier encounter or even an earlier adventure-an item that lets the character be useful in the battle despite the monster's resistances. If a PC druid has no magic weapons and you're planning an iron golem encounter, give her a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay0c4d.html?FinalName=Golembane%20Scarab">golembane scarab</a> so she can better attack it in wild shape. If a PC rogue has no bludgeoning weapons to use against a black pudding, let her find a low-level <a href="spelldisplay2658.html?ItemName=magic%20missile">wand of magic missile</a> and blast away using Use Magic Device. Many items and spells in the game are designed to deal with unusual encounters, but don't see play very much because PCs prefer general-utility magic; introducing a cheap or expendable item like this gives smart players something to fall back on if their primary strategy isn't effective or if they run into an encounter where the unusual tool is exactly what they need.

Present Other Options: Just because the encounter involves a monster doesn't mean that all the PCs have to focus on defeating that monster. Create another task that helps overcome the monster, prepares for the next encounter, or disables a parallel threat during the fight. For example, in a fight against a bunch of black puddings, rather than having the rogue frustrated by not being able to use sneak attack, add a spiked wall trap that the rogue can disable while the other characters deal with the oozes. If the encounter has an iron golem and the wizard has no electricity attacks to slow it, put a magical puzzle-crystal in the room that unlocks a secret room if the wizard makes a Knowledge (arcana) check. If the party cleric channels negative energy and the other PCs are fighting undead (meaning the cleric would heal enemies if she tried to channel), include a door made of fused bone that only opens from a focused blast of negative energy. If the opponent is resistant to physical attacks, put a chained prisoner in the room that the barbarian, fighter, or paladin can rescue while the spellcasters deal with the threat.
