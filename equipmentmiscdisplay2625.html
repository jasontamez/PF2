Description

You steep these herbs in hot water, then drink the resulting tisane while it's still warm before going to bed. While you sleep, you experience vivid hallucinations that offer insight into matters with which you previously had only limited familiarity. After 8 hours of uninterrupted rest, you can attempt a previously failed Knowledge check with a +2 alchemical bonus.
