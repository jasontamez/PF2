Description

Many seasoned military commanders in Molthune wear this style of silver helmet adorned with a single oversized red plume. If the wearer of an Imperial Army greathelm has the Leadership feat, he gains a +3 bonus to his Leadership score, and any of his followers or cohorts gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects while they're within line of sight of him.

If the wearer possesses the tactician class feature, the range of that ability increases to 60 feet.
