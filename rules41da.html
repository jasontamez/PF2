Low-level enchantment spells that are appropriate for wilderness campaigns most often focus on the manipulation of animal minds. Keep in mind that animals are often simple creatures, with simple thoughts driving their actions-drinking, eating, and sleeping being at the forefront of an animal's mind. Due to having average or lower Wisdom scores, certain kinds of animals can be especially prone to being affected by these spells.

<a href="spelldisplayf10e.html?ItemName=Animal%20Messenger">Animal Messenger</a>: This spell compels a Tiny animal to venture to a designated area, likely with an item in tow. The longer casting time of the spell makes it useless in combat situations but incredibly helpful in other situations. Delivery of an item via <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a> isn't guaranteed, as the animal could be waylaid by other creatures or potentially find itself unable to follow directions to the intended area. As with most spells, it's important to understand that a PC shouldn't be penalized for the casting of such magic. If you, as the GM, decide to have an <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a> fail to reach its intended destination, consider rewarding the PCs in another way. For example, the <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a> might have been consumed by a local predator, and by finding the slain messenger, the PCs uncover the predator's stash of claimed trophies.

<a href="spelldisplayaef7.html?ItemName=Calm%20Animals">Calm Animals</a>, <a href="spelldisplay6e34.html?ItemName=Charm%20Animal">Charm Animal</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay8fc4.html?ItemName=Dominate%20Animal">Dominate Animal</a>: Spells that can adjust the attitudes of animals have obvious uses as deterrents when traversing through wilderness environments. Simply calming or charming animals is often sufficient to travel through an area without harassment, while more powerful spells such as <a href="spelldisplay3821.html?ItemName=dominate%20animal">dominate animal</a> can be used to deal with more dangerous or more immediate threats. Another insidious use of this magic is to subvert the loyal animal companions of foes. The ability to charm or dominate an animal companion of an opponent can significantly reduce the challenge of an encounter, while simultaneously presenting that foe the moral quandary of how to handle its wayward companion.
