Tactics

Before Combat The rogue understands that fighting and killing raises too many questions, and thus uses Diplomacy and Bluff to avoid combat and maintain his cover if at all possible.
During Combat The rogue prefers to use sneak attacks and disarm combat maneuvers against his opponents, and flees if he can get away safely. If any who are present can identify him as a spy-or if their continued existence is against the interests of his shadowy paymasters-he strikes to kill.

Kelethiros

Kelethiros is a valuable and dangerous member of royal courts and secret societies, skilled at using subtle lies and disguises to turn enemies against each other. Using his talents-and a little help from his hat of disguise-he can infiltrate and spy upon any guild, government, or noble household. His only flaw is that he is easily distracted by an attractive face and strong, slender legs, and often has to extricate himself when confronted by hoodwinked lovers and enraged spouses.

Though able to move easily in most societies by virtue of his handsome face and disarming nature, Kelethiros is at heart a racist, and prefers to operate on behalf of elven interests against those of other races, particularly humans. He strongly resents the way that the shorter-lived races have expanded and achieved so much so quickly, and on those occasions when he allows his cover stories to slip, has often been heard to refer to the works of these other races as akin to "children playing at civilization." Of course, this general disdain for humanity doesn't keep him from taking human lovers while on his missions, and no doubt quite a few half-elves can trace their lineage to one of his false personas. His prejudice also makes it easier on those occasions when his missions or cover requires him to kill, as he tells himself with that killing humans and their ilk isn't really murder. After all, since they're going to die so soon anyway, he's only robbed them of a few decades at most-hardly anything for an elf to get upset about.

Combat Encounters: Kelethiros prefers to work behind the scenes, and avoids combat unless he's confident of winning. Instead, he uses disguise magic to turn the PCs' allies against them, to frame the PCs for an attack on someone, or to change his appearance just before the battle with the PCs begins so it looks like they have set upon some innocent person.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Like a doppelganger, Kelethiros could play many roles in a campaign, sometimes helping the PCs out with information, but just as often opposing or observing them.
