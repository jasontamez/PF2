Tactics

Before Combat The druid casts spike growth twice per day to protect her position, using stone shape if necessary to limit any viable approaches to her.
During Combat The druid wild shapes into a small flying animal at the first opportunity to escape melee. On subsequent rounds, she casts soften earth and stone and spike growth to distort the terrain beneath her enemies. She intersperses these spells with speak with animals and summoning spells to call flying creatures to harass those enemies. Once her spells are exhausted, she uses acid dart.

Though most druids tend and protect the wild lands that lie under the open sky, others stalk the tunnels that lie beneath the earth, serving as wardens, protectors, and tenders of vermin and fungi.

Zirul

Zirul is the solemn protector of a large cave system that is rife with bats and vermin of all kind. Having been abandoned here at a young age, she sees the cave as her home, and will not allow anyone to access it. She dresses in dark, splotched clothing to better blend in with the cavern walls, and has lost some of her humanity as a result of living so far from civilization for so long.

Combat Encounters: Zirul's combat axiom is that a good defense lays the groundwork for a devastating offense. She always makes sure to enter combat from a position of defensive strength.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Zirul has nearly lost her ability to feel empathy for other humanoids. She constantly mutters to herself and to the rats that swarm around her, ignoring other people's perturbed reactions to her odd behavior.
