Deities: Gozreh, Pharasma.

Ice Strike (minor): At 1st level, you can touch one weapon and enhance it with the power of water. For 1 minute, this weapon glows with a blue-white chill and deals an additional 1d4 points of cold damage with each strike. This additional damage doesn't stack with the additional damage from the frost or icy burst weapon special abilities.

Armor of Ice (major): At 10th level, you can touch any one ally and wreath it in freezing mist. This works as fire shield (chill shield only) with a duration 1 minute.
