Obedience

Craft a small poppet in the shape of a flea, tick, stirge, or other such plague-carrying creature, using natural materials such as straw, and mixing your blood with foul-smelling mud or dung to bind the poppet together. As it dries over the course of an hour, recite verses invoking virulence, filth, and affliction on the living while applying leeches to your flesh. At the end of the hour, burn the poppet and the leeches, inhaling the foul vapors while meditating on the purging effects of disease on the living while your leech-drawn blood burns in sacrifice to Ghlaunder. If you are affected by a disease, any ability score damage or drain you would take from that disease today is halved; if you would take 1 point of ability score damage, you instead take none. You can still contract diseases and spread them to others as normal.

1: Cult of Contagion (Sp) ray of sickening 3/day, pox pustules 2/day, or contagion 1/day
2: Nauseating Strike (Ex) You know how to use others' capacity for revulsion as a weapon against them. Three times per day, you can make a nauseating strike against an opponent through your weapon, causing the target to feel the effects of a sickening disease. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack, and if your attack misses, the strike is wasted. On a hit, your target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice) or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds, in addition to the normal weapon damage.
3: Debilitating Blight (Sp) Once per day, you can cast greater contagion as a spell-like ability, infecting the target with a virulent and debilitating disease that takes effect immediately; the DC to resist this disease is 4 higher than normal. In addition to the effects of the disease, the subject is debilitated with wracking coughs and painful, bursting pustules. The incessant sickness imposes a -2 penalty on the target's attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability modifiers for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice.

1: Infectious Blighter (Sp) inflict light wounds 3/day, accelerate poison 2/day, or nauseating trail 1/day
2: Blighting Channel (Su) You bring the desolation of drought and blight to the landscapes through which you pass. Three times per day when you channel negative energy, you can choose to cause damage to plants and plant creatures instead of healing undead. Creatures with the plant type within range take 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 additional points for every 2 cleric levels beyond 1st you have (maximum 10d6 at 19th level), and can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (using the same DC as for your regular uses of channel negative energy) for half damage. All normal plants in range immediately wither and die (no saving throw).
3: Polluted Servant (Sp) Ghlaunder gifts his most devoted with servants of living filth that fight on the supplicants' behalf to sow death and disease. Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a hezrou demon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 62) to serve you. The demon follows your commands for 1 round for every Hit Die you have before vanishing back to its home. It doesn't obey commands that would make it perform overtly good acts, and if such instructions are particularly egregious, they could prompt the demon to attack you.

Sentinel

1: Poisonous Penitent (Sp) nauseating dart 3/day, pernicious poison 2/day, or poison 1/day
2: Bloodletter (Ex) You have trained extensively with Ghlaunder's favored weapon in order to cause severe trauma to your enemies, opening their veins so their blood might spill forth as an offering to your god. You gain a +1 profane bonus on all attack and damage rolls with a spear. In addition, when you confirm a critical hit, your target takes 1 point of bleed damage for every 2 character levels you have. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped with a successful DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability or any other effect does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might have.
3: Horrible Blow (Sp) Once per day, you can inflict a debilitating disease upon your target through your weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. On a hit, the target is affected as if the subject of horrid wilting cast by a wizard of a level equal to your Hit Dice (maximum CL 20th), as well as normal weapon damage. If you miss with your attack, the use of this ability is wasted.

Clerics, druids, and rangers of Ghlaunder, upon first gaining the ability to cast divine spells, may choose to affect vermin instead of animals when using animal-oriented spells (such as animal shapes, detect animals or plants, and hide from animals); these spells can no longer be used to affect animals.
