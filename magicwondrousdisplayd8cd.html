Description

These black gloves are decorated with images of white bones, as if revealing the bones within the wearer's hands. The left glove can be used once per day to create a spectral hand, which makes the bony hand image on that glove slide off and manifest as a ghostly skeletal hand for the duration of the effect. The right glove can be used once per day to deliver an inflict moderate wounds spell, which gives that hand's bones a pale, sickly glow until the touch is delivered or discharged. If the wearer is a living creature, he can also use the right glove on himself to cast cure moderate wounds instead of inflict moderate wounds.
