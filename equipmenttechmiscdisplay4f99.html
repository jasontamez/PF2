Description

This spherical object is the size of a human head. When it's activated, several panels on its surface fold back and extend dozens of arms tipped with cup-shaped flashing lights. Once activated, a signal booster amplifies the strength of any signal-based technology effect within 600 feet, doubling the effective range of the signal. For example, a commset (see page 42) normally has a range of 1 mile, but in the area of effect of a signal booster, this range increases to 2 miles. For more information on signals, see the On Signals sidebar on page 43.
