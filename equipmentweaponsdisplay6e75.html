Description

A hurlbat is a throwing axe made from a single piece of flat metal. Every extremity of the hurlbat is sharpened, including the point of the handle. You can wield the hurlbat as a melee weapon, but it's not designed for such use; you take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls with the weapon, and you must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save when making melee attacks to avoid cutting yourself on an edge and taking 1 point of slashing damage. You don't need to attempt this save while wearing heavy armor.
