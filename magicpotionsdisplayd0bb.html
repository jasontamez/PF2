Description

These sour, chewy treats seem to be all but bursting with vitality and energy. After eating a handful of sun-dried lantern lemons you glow as brightly as a daylight spell for 1 hour. The light shines out of your skin, and while you can cover yourself to block the light and reduce its effect to that of a light spell or even a candle, only magical darkness or complete enshrouding (such as wrapping yourself from head to toe in layers of cloth or leather) can fully block the light.

Lesser forms of these treats exist that cause you to shine with a fainter light and for a shorter duration. Elven actors sometimes use these fainter variants in stage productions to represent angelic beings.
