Description

This small, blue figurine is fashioned in the likeness of a scarab beetle, the sacred animal of Khepri, the Ancient Osirian god of freedom, the rising sun, and work. Once per day, the bearer of the scarab can speak with vermin as if using speak with animals, though the information obtained is very limited. If the bearer has the wild empathy class feature, she may use it to influence vermin as easily as she influences animals. Once per day, the bearer can cast summon swarm to summon a swarm of scarab beetles (treat as a spider swarm, but instead of poison, the swarm causes filth fever).
