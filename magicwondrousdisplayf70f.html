Description

The following wondrous item is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

This mithral crowbar can coax stone to shift aside with alarming ease. Five times per day, when a kobold wielder pries at a section of stone and speaks a command word, the touched rock reshapes as if with stone shape.

Additionally, once per day a kobold wielder can throw the crowbar like a thrown splash weapon at a spot of earth, metal, or stone to unleash an earthquake on the spot where the crowbar lands.
