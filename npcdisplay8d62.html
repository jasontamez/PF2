Seductive enchanters use magic so they can enjoy mortal pleasures. This usually means influencing people to give them things. These wizards can be found anywhere they can get the finer things in life. Many of them become connoisseurs of one particular pleasure, going from place to place and scamming people into giving them the rarest gems or pieces from master artists, or coercing kisses from the most attractive nobles.

Vaeleus the Charmer

Vaeleus has a reputation for getting what she wants-fine food, quality wine, even sex. What she can't manage to get with ordinary looks, words, and caresses, she gets by using magic. Many people in whatever town she resides in might consider themselves her greatest lover, best friend, or trusted confidant. Vaeleus has gotten used to her lies and tricks eventually falling apart; she often has to leave town in a hurry when lovers or merchants realize they've been compelled against their will. For Vaeleus, it's a simple enough matter to just find a new town with new targets and new pleasures to experience. She doesn't waste time worrying about the bridges she's burned-after all, those people aren't worth anything to her now.

Combat Encounters: The PCs might fight Vaeleus because she took advantage of one of their friends or allies. If she has really sunken her claws in, though, that friend might take her side and fight against the PCs.

Roleplaying Suggestions: In certain circles, Vaeleus is well respected, and can do no wrong. People might recommend the PCs talk to her for information or contacts. She seems to know everyone, and can pull all sorts of strings for the right fee. Of course, she-d rather just take the fee and not do any work, using enchantments to skip the hard part.
