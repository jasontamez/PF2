Description

This container of sickly gray paste
can coat the armor of one Medium or
two Small creatures. Affected objects
produce dark gray fumes for the next
24 hours. These fumes cause natural
plants to wilt and diminish as soon as
they come into contact with the affected armor. This allows
the wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the
presence of vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the
creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition,
creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone
protected by defoliant polish with a natural attack or grapple
take 1 point of damage with each successful attack or each
round they maintain the grapple.
