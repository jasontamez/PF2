Description

An effigy of the favored servant is a thumb-sized figurine of wondrous power depicting a marble, toga-wearing slave. When commanded, the statue grows and animates with the same statistics as a hill giant. The giant has no hint of personality, but is capable of telepathically receiving orders from the item's possessor up to a range of 100 feet. The item can be used twice a week for up to 6 hours per use. If animated in an area too small for the giant to appear in, the figurine simply doesn't animate, with no weekly use expended.

In addition to its use as a figurine of wondrous power, an effigy of the favored servant can be used as the repository of a dying soul once per day. By spending a full round action on a sentient, living creature reduced to -1 or fewer hit points, the effigy's bearer can draw its soul into the statuette, killing the creature if it fails a DC 22 Will save. From that time forward, the giant summoned by the figurine has the same personality as the killed creature. The creature must obey the figurine bearer's commands, and the effigy functions as normal. The creature retains none of the skills or abilities it had in life, being effectively trapped within the statuette. The creature cannot be resurrected or otherwise returned to life unless the effigy is destroyed. If the effigy is used to trap another dying soul, the first is released and may be raised normally.
