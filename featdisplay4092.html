You are adept at borrowing from your allies even in the middle of combat.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>, base attack bonus +1, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, swarming racial trait.

Benefit:  While you are in the same square as a willing ally who also has this feat, you can draw a weapon from that creature as a free action or draw a hidden weapon or any other object as a move action. You can also take a held object from a willing ally in the same square as you as a free action. Drawing or taking an object (but not a weapon) in this way provokes an attack of opportunity.
