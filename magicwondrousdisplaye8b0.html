Description

This item takes the form of a half-dozen brown beans, usually contained in a simple burlap sack. Ten minutes after the beans are planted in the ground, they sprout into a 350-foot-tall beanstalk as if created by the beanstalk spell (see page 70). The magic beans are consumed in the process. The beanstalk lasts for 24 hours before collapsing into a pile of rotten plant matter.
