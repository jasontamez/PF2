Of those Gray Maidens who remain loyal to the ideals of Queen Ileosa, none have seen as much success as the members of the Erinyes Company. The company's origin lies with a band of Gray Maidens led by Qualins Rachmirol, who commandeered a ship in the wake of Ileosa's defeat and sailed to Cheliax. Her Infernal Majestrix was impressed by the soldiers' devotion and prowess; Abrogail adopted them into the Chelish military and gave the group its new name.

The Erinyes Company has expanded from its original 27 members, although not drastically, as the initiation process for new recruits is intense and often lethal. By the end, the survivors are every bit as physically and psychologically scarred as the original Gray Maidens. The company has, however, abandoned Ileosa's doctrine of racial purity; drive and will are what make an Erinyes, not skin or shape.

Elite Erinyes Company members are heartless soldiers known as sanguine angels. While the Gray Maidens were once a secular organization, the majority of the Erinyes have turned to worship the infernal demigoddesses known as the Queens of the Night. These vengeful devils reward the company's elite with infernal powers.

The following are class features of the sanguine angel prestige class.

Hardened Heart (Ex) A sanguine angel adds twice her class level to the DC of any attempt to Intimidate her.

Maiden's Shield (Ex) A sanguine angel is treated as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat as long as she is using a longsword and a shield. This allows her to take feats that require Two-Weapon Fighting as a prerequisite without meeting the Two-Weapon Fighting or Dexterity prerequisites, but she benefits from such feats only when she's wielding a longsword and shield.

Tyrant's Discipline (Ex) The Erinyes Company's initiation is deeply indoctrinating, and so sanguine angels are as loyal to the Infernal Majestrix as the Gray Maidens were to Ileosa. At 2nd level, a sanguine angel draws upon her indoctrination, tactical training, and devotion to tyranny to develop potent talents. A sanguine angel selects a discipline from the following list at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter.

Castling: When the sanguine angel takes a 5-foot step, she can step into the space of a willing, adjacent ally. If she does, that ally immediately takes a 5-foot step into the sanguine angel's former space without spending an action to do so.

Driving Assault: When making a full attack, the sanguine angel can take a -2 penalty on melee attack rolls for 1 round. If she does, the first time in that round that she hits a creature of her size or smaller with a melee attack, she can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check to push the creature back 5 feet. She gains a +2 bonus on this combat maneuver check and does not provoke attacks of opportunity when performing the bull rush, but regardless of the result, she cannot push the target further than 5 feet. If the sanguine angel pushes a creature in this way, she can immediately move into its space without provoking attacks of opportunity.

Erinyes Fury: The sanguine angel can enter a dispassionate, murderous state. This functions as the dreadnought barbarian's dead calm ability (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures 47) and is usable for a number of rounds each day equal to twice her class level. If the sanguine angel has levels in barbarian and has the dreadnought archetype, her sanguine angel levels instead stack with her barbarian levels to determine the duration of her rage.

Furious Huntress: The sanguine angel adds her Strength bonus, rather than her Dexterity bonus, to attack rolls made with bows.

Kinslayer: The sanguine angel gains favored enemy (humanoids [humans] +2), as per the ranger ability. If the sanguine angel already has the same favored enemy bonus from another class, her existing bonus instead increases by 2.

Merciless Massacre: When the sanguine angel hits a cowering or panicked creature with a melee attack or reduces a creature to negative hit points with a melee attack, as a swift action she can deal additional damage to that creature equal to 1d8 + her class level.

Queen's Sword: The sanguine angel's weapon training bonus with heavy blades increases by 1. The sanguine angel must have at least 4 levels in this prestige class and have the weapon training (heavy blades) class feature to select this discipline. The sanguine angel can select this discipline a second time when her class level is 8th level or higher.

Unyielding: While wearing Gray Maiden plate (see page 84), the sanguine angel gains DR 1/-. The character must have at least 6 levels in this prestige class to select this discipline. The damage reduction increases to DR/2 at 8th level and to DR/3 at 10th level. This damage reduction does not stack with damage reduction granted by other sources.

Armored Angel (Ex): At 3rd level, a sanguine angel gains the armor training class feature, treating her class level as her fighter level while wearing Gray Maiden plate. If the sanguine angel has levels in another class that grants the armor training class feature, the levels stack to determine its benefits, but only when she is wearing Gray Maiden plate.

Eye of Mahathallah (Su): The Dowager of Illusion, the first Queen of the Night to grant her favor to the Erinyes Company, grants sanguine angels keen eyes to pierce all deception. At 5th level, a sanguine angel gains Alertness as a bonus feat and gains a +4 profane bonus on Will saves against illusions. In addition, once per day as a swift action, the sanguine angel can take 1d4 points of Charisma damage to gain the benefits of the true seeing spell for a number of rounds equal to her class level.

Mystique of Ardad Lili (Ex and Sp): Though most sanguine angels care little for seduction, the End of Innocence grants them influence over others regardless. At 7th level, a sanguine angel gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against targets of the same creature type as the sanguine angel. Once per day, the sanguine angel can use dominate person as a spell-like ability (CL = her character level).

Hollowness of Doloras (Ex): The gift of Our Lady of Pain is freedom-freedom from horror and pain, from sorrow and fear. At 9th level, a sanguine angel gains Diehard as a bonus feat. In addition, she gains a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against emotion and pain effects, and she is immune to fear effects.

Angel of Eiseth (Su): The greatest sanguine angels earn the favor of the Erinyes Queen Eiseth, who transforms them into infernal servitors. At 10th level, a sanguine angel's type changes to outsider (evil, extraplanar, lawful), and Hell becomes her native plane. She gains fire resistance 30, telepathy with a range of 50 feet, and the see in darkness universal monster ability. Ebon-feathered wings emerge from the sanguine angel's back, granting her a fly speed of 50 feet with good maneuverability.
