Tidal Swiftness (Conduit)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpya1am">Planar Adventures pg. 33</a>
A surge of churning, rushing water from the Plane of Water drives you swiftly across the ground, even in the most arid or frigid of regions. This magically conjured water does not last long once it surges to enhance your speed, but its appearance can certainly astound those unaccustomed to such sights.

Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can call forth a tide of water that flows around your feet and enhances your speed, as per slipstream.

You can use this feat's benefit for a number of minutes per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.
