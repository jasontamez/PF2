To use simplified spellcasting, find the appropriate progression table for your class (or the table for a class that normally has the same spell progression as your class) and consult the row for your caster level. The 3 highest spell levels in the row each have a listed number indicating spells per day. Prepare these spells each day as you normally would; you still gain bonus spells per day for those levels if you have a high enough ability score. The letter -P- appears in the columns of all other available spell levels (except level 0) to indicate lower-level spells that are cast using your class's spell pool.

Each day, you can spontaneously cast a number of lower-level spells from your class's spell list equal to the number listed for your class level in the Pool column of the table. The level of spell doesn't matter (as long as it's one of the levels that uses your pool), so if you could cast five spells from your pool per day, it wouldn't matter if you cast five 1stlevel spells, five 2nd-level spells, or a mix of the two. A spell cast using slots from your spell pool must still be on your spell list or in your spellbook, just as it would need to be if you were preparing the spell. It also must meet any other restrictions imposed by your class or other abilities, such as restrictions on casting spells of an opposing alignment. The slots in your spell pool refresh after 8 hours of rest, and any effect that prevents you from preparing spells also prevents you from refreshing your spell pool. Your pool increases if you have a high spellcasting ability modifier, similar to how you gain bonus spells in slots you prepare. Add a number of spells to your pool equal to 1/4 the ability score modifier of the ability score you would normally use to calculate your number of bonus spells per day.

If your class grants bonus spells that are selected from an extremely limited number of options (such as domain spells, spirit spells, or similar bonus spells), you gain those spells separately from your pool. If your class grants bonus spells from a somewhat limited list (such as wizards' specialty school spells), when you gain a pool, you gain one additional slot in your spell pool each day that can be used only to cast spells of that type, and at 13th level you gain a second additional slot with the same restriction.

For example, a 13th-level necromancer with an Intelligence score of 26 has a pool of five spells-three for being a 13th-level wizard and two for his high Intelligence (a +8 Intelligence modifier divided by 4)-as well as two additional spells per day that must be from the necromancy school. He could use the pool to cast his 1st- to 4th-level spells, but would still need to prepare his 5th- to 7th-level spells.

Expending Multiple Spell Slots: If you have a class ability that requires expending multiple spell slots, such as a <a href="mysterydisplay55dc.html?ItemName=Battle">battle oracle's combat healer revelation</a> or a wizard's opposition school, you must expend the appropriate number of slots from your spell pool to use the ability. For instance, if the 13th-level necromancer in the example above has conjuration as an opposition school, he could expend two slots from his spell pool to cast <a href="spelldisplay72b3.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%202">summon monster II</a>.
