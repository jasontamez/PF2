You can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity when moving through a threatened square. If you fail, your movement ends and you provoke an attack of opportunity from the threatening opponent. You move at half speed when you tumble, but you can move at full speed if you increase the DC by 10. If you try to tumble past multiple opponents in the same round, attempt an Acrobatics check against each of them. The DC increases by 2 for each opponent beyond the first.

Action: None.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Intended Movement</td><td>Acrobatics DC</td></tr> <tr><td>Move through a threatened area</td><td>Opponent's CMD</td></tr> <tr><td>Move through an enemy's space</td><td>5 + opponent's CMD</td></tr> </table>

Loads: You can't tumble when carrying a medium or heavy load or wearing medium or heavy armor unless an ability allows you to move at full speed in such conditions.

Prone: You can tumble while prone, but this is a full-round action to move 5 feet, and the DC increases by 5.
