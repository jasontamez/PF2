Description

This dull black suit of +2 scale mail does not impose an armor check penalty on the wearer's Stealth checks, though other armor check penalties apply as normal. Additionally, infiltrator's mail reacts to detect magic as though it were nonmagical and, when worn, extends this effect to all other magic items worn or held by the wearer unless the viewer uses identify or a similar effect while examining the items.
