Description

This ornate, oversized silver goblet is wrought with runes and letters in a profusion of languages. When written words are placed in the goblet-whether written on a piece of parchment, carved into stone, or other such means of delivering physical text-the text detaches itself from the source, liquefying into a sweet wine over the next 10 minutes. The liquid can then be drunk, granting the imbiber benefits based on the nature of the text. <ul><li>Pages from a spellbook representing a single spell can be drunk, allowing an arcane spontaneous caster to add that spell to her list of spells known for 24 hours. The spell must be on the imbiber's spell list.</li><li>An arcane scroll can be drunk, allowing the immediate memorization of its contents by an arcane caster who prepares spells. The memorized spell must be on the imbiber's class spell list and still requires an open spell slot of the appropriate level to use. The imbiber uses her own caster level and spellcasting ability modifier to cast the spell, rather than the caster level of the scroll.</li><li>Nonmagical writing can also be drunk, granting a complete understanding of the text's contents. This doesn't require an understanding of the text's language. The goblet can liquefy the text of up to 10 standard-sized pages at once.</li></ul> In all cases, the text is destroyed once drunk, and the knowledge gained fades after 24 hours. The goblet can be used three times per day.
