Trigger proximity (15 feet); Reset none
Effect The faceless statue trap targets a creature with a <a href="spelldisplay3be0.html?ItemName=flesh%20to%20stone">flesh to stone</a> effect (DC 19, single target), followed immediately by a <a href="spelldisplay5dc8.html?ItemName=stone%20shape">stone shape</a> effect, which completely smooths the face of the target, making it appear to be faceless. If the creature is returned to flesh, this transformation persists, rendering the target permanently blind, deaf, mute, and unable to breathe. Unless the change is reversed via <a href="spelldisplayb175.html?ItemName=regenerate">regenerate</a> or other magic capable of restoring the target's mouth or nose, or unless the target is able to survive without breathing, the creature begins to suffocate immediately. Using <a href="spelldisplay5dc8.html?ItemName=stone%20shape">stone shape</a> on the creature while it is still petrified can restore its face, preventing this, but only if the caster succeeds at a DC 25 Craft (sculpture) check. Otherwise, the spell creates a grotesque parody of a face, formed entirely of flesh and without function. Other variants of this trap exist that perform similarly grotesque alterations to a creature via <a href="spelldisplay5dc8.html?ItemName=stone%20shape">stone shape</a>.
