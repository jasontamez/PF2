The first thing to know is that there are such things as being too loud and too quiet as the GM. If you spend the whole game talking, with players barely squeezing in hit and damage information, you're likely overbearing and boring your players. But just as dangerous is the GM that's too quiet; if you're intimidated or underprepared, you won't have enough description to really give the players a sense of place, and one room of the castle or dungeon will feel pretty much like another.

There are ways to get across evocative information without writing out reams of text ahead of time. For instance, you might write down three or five words to describe each room, and then riff on those when the time comes to describe it. The words "purple tapestry, enormous fireplace, owlbear pelt on floor" set up a very different room than "bloodspattered walls, black candles, rusty manacles." In each case, you've got enough to fix an image in the players' minds, without going overboard on description.

Once you have that, you'll probably also want to add any pertinent notes on treasure, unusual terrain or interactive elements (such as a well or a dangerously weak support stanchion), or hidden terrain elements like traps or secret doors.

This same approach works well for NPCs, though in most cases you need more than just physical description. If you boil it down, most NPCs need a name, a speaking style, a general appearance, weapons and armor, and a motivation or goal. If you have all those, it's often possible to play a roleplaying scene without generating further stats for the NPC.
