Stupefying Strike (Combat)

Your batter your foes with such disorienting force that they can't exert their full abilities.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, Wis 13, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8.

Benefit: When using this feat, in addition to dealing damage normally, you force a foe damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Wisdom modifier). If it fails, it loses its skill ranks and activated feats, such as <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a> or <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist</a>, for 1d4 rounds. You must declare you are using this feat before you make your attack roll; if you miss, the target is unaffected and your attempt is wasted. You can try to use Stupefying Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, mindless creatures, plants, undead, and creatures immune to critical hits can't be affected by this ability.
