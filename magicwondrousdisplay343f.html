Description

This holy symbol is always warm to the touch, and whenever it strikes metal it rings out with the sound of a choir of angels. When used as a divine focus for a divine spell, the symbol emits a bright light that heals its wearer of a number of points of damage equal to the spell's level.

If the wearer expends one use of mythic power when casting a divine spell that uses this holy symbol as its divine focus, the emblem glows for a number of rounds equal to the wearer's mythic tier, shedding light like a torch. Instead of this item's normal effect, at the start of each of the wearer's turns, she and all her allies within 30 feet heal a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + the wearer's tier. This effect lasts as long as the light persists.
