Description

Crafted by the fabled thaumaturge Sekhmenathes of An for Hakotep's grandfather, these two symbols of rulership were passed down to the Sky Pharaoh by his father and buried with Hakotep in his crypt when his successor Djederet II ascended the throne.

The crook is an 18-inch-long cane with a hooked head made of gold reinforced with blue copper bands. It functions as a greater empower metamagic rod.

The flail is a 2-foot-long rod of gold, ending with three beaded strands of semi-precious stones. It functions as both a greater reach metamagic rod and a +2 thundering flail.

When the crook and flail are held simultaneously, one in each hand, the wielder can cast spells without providing somatic components (as Still Spell, but this doesn't use a higher level spell slot or increase casting time). Furthermore, once per day as an immediate action, the wielder can reflect spells cast against him for 1 round (as spell turning) up to a total of 9 spell levels. If the wielder is a spellcaster, he can expend a prepared spell or spell slot to use this ability again; he can reflect a total number of spell levels equal to the level of the expended spell.

Destruction

If the rightful ruler of Osirion strikes the crook and flail together with the intent to break them, both items shatter and turn instantly to sand.
