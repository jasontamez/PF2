You are quite adept at killing your prey without making noise or alerting others.

Prerequisites: Stealth 12 ranks; assassinate advanced slayer talent or ninja master trick.

Benefit:  When you kill a creature during a surprise round, you can attempt a Stealth check, opposed by the Perception checks of potential observers, to prevent them from noticing your action and subsequently identifying you as the assailant.

When you use this feat, you can spend a number of stamina points up to your Dexterity bonus and gain a bonus on the Stealth check equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
