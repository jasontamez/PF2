Description

When chewed, this spongy gum releases mild stimulants that heighten your focus. Derros use focus chew in an effort to improve their experiments, though spellcasters from other Darklands cultures have adopted their recipe for use in research. For up to 1 hour while chewing focus chew, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on concentration checks and a +1 alchemical bonus on Intelligence-based skill checks.
