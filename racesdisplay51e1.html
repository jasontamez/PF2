Triaxians, the race of humanoids native to Triaxus, have developed an amazing physiological adaptation to their planet's centuries-long seasons. The average Triaxian lives for only 80 years, so entire generations experience nothing but endless summer or winter throughout their lifetimes. Those born in the lush, verdant summer season, called Summerborn, typically have dark skin, little body hair, and wide, expressive eyes. Winterborn, on the other hand, come into being on a world dominated by the snows of an endless winter, and sport fine, white fur coats and narrow eyes that help protect them from frigid temperatures and snow blindness.

In the relatively short period between summer and winter, the birth of Transitional Triaxians heralds the arrival of either spring or autumn, and is a cause for celebration of impending easy living or a sign of hard times to come, respectively. No more than a single generation of such children are born for each transition in each orbital year. Transitional Triaxians are bereft of any of the environmentally adaptive benefits of their kin. Curiously, Triaxians born on other worlds exhibit Summerborn, Winterborn, or Transitional traits that follow the same pattern as their home world, indicating that their physiological adaptations to the Triaxian environment function according to an internal biological clock rather than in response to external stimuli.

Triaxian culture also transforms with the seasons. Winterborn place a strong value on commitment, honor, and the honesty. Friendship is not readily granted, but neither is it lightly forsaken. Summerborn are nomadic, free-spirited people who are quick to accept outsiders and just as quick to break with clan or tradition. Summerborn and Winterborn rarely meet under normal circumstances, so for the most part they must understand each other through history.
