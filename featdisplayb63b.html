You can reshape the kinetic energy of foes' charges.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay8a1d.html?ItemName=Improved%20Reposition">Improved Reposition</a>, base attack bonus +1 or monk level 1st.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus to AC against charge attacks. If a creature charges you and fails its attack roll, as an immediate action you can attempt a reposition combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) to reposition that foe. If you use a readied action to attack a creature charging you, you can roll to attack and then attempt to reposition that creature as a free action before it resolves its charge attack.

Note:  A monk can take this feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. To benefit from this feat, monks must have both hands free and be capable of delivering an unarmed strike.
