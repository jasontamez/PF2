Gunslingers usually don't use heavy armor, but there are a few who use and modify their armor to protect themselves from both traditional weapons and gunfire. These gun tanks trundle into battle with barrels blazing, dealing out punishment with their firearms while knowing few can penetrate their hard protective shells.

Armor Proficiency:  A gun tank is proficient with all armors and shields, including tower shields.

Deeds:  A gun tank swaps a pair of deeds for the following. The new deed descriptions include information on which deeds from the gunslinger class feature these new deeds replace.

Gun Tank's Resolve (Ex): At 1st level, the gun tank can shrug off the most serious of attacks. When the gun tank is wearing medium or heavy armor and is subject to a critical hit or sneak attack, she can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to attempt to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. At 1st level, she has a 25% chance of doing so. At 10th level, the chance increases to 50%. At 15th level, the chance increases to 75%. While a gun tank's resolve does not stack with the fortification armor special ability, it does work in concert with that armor special ability or similar effects, so a gun tank can use this ability even after the armor of fortification has failed to negate the critical hit or sneak attack damage. This deed replaces the gunslinger's dodge deed.

Gun Tank's Resilience (Ex): At 15th level, when the gun tank has at least 1 grit point and makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an attack that would deal half damage or have a partial effect, she takes no damage or other effects from that attack. Furthermore, she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This deed replaces the evasive deed.

Bullet Defection (Ex):  A gun tank is adept at modifying and using her armor to stop firearm attacks. Starting at 2nd level, a gun tank wearing medium or heavy armor gains half the armor's bonus plus the armor's enhancement bonus (if any) as a deflection bonus against any non-siege firearm or splash weapon attack (including the alchemist's bomb class ability). This ability has no affect on spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities that make a touch attack. This ability replaces nimble.

Armor Training (Ex):  At 4th level, a gun tank learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever she is wearing armor, the armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by her armor increases by 1. Every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and 16th), the bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of a -4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase to the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This ability stacks with the fighter class ability of the same name. If the gun tank has both class features, she takes the most advantageous benefit of the two class features. This ability replaces the bonus feats the gunslinger gains at 4th level and every four levels thereafter.
