Description

This amethyst stone strung on a coarse iron chain protects
the wearer from curses. Three times per day, whenever
the wearer rolls a saving throw against a curse (such as
a witch's hex, or a bestow curse spell), he may reroll the
saving throw as an immediate action. The wearer must
decide to use this ability before the results of the saving
throw are revealed. He must take the second roll, even if
it is worse.
