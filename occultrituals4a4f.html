Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The ritual allows the primary caster to observe an area at any distance, as per <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying"></a>, except that the sensor created for this scrying effect is an enormous visible image of the primary caster in the air above the area (even if the area viewed is indoors or underground) that cannot be dispelled. This image can take any form that the primary caster desires, such as an exact replica or a shape formed from shadows or clouds, but the image is always recognizable as the primary caster. The primary caster can speak to any creatures in the area with a loud voice that emanates from the image. The following spells function reliably through the sensor: <a href="spelldisplaye512.html?ItemName=detect%20chaos">detect chaos</a>, <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a>, <a href="spelldisplay0498.html?ItemName=detect%20good">detect good</a>, <a href="spelldisplay93cd.html?ItemName=detect%20law">detect law</a>, <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a>, <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a>, <a href="spelldisplayd1c2.html?ItemName=message">message</a>, <a href="spelldisplay6868.html?ItemName=read%20magic">read magic</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4d62.html?ItemName=tongues">tongues</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a>. Any other spell requires a successful concentration check to function through the image (DC = 20 + double the level of the spell); on a failure, the spell is lost.
