Description

The ratfolk of Diguo-Dashu, the "Empire of the Rats," developed this poison to help their soldiers in overtaking foes. The poison produces lactic acids that slowly degrade the target's muscles, though for full efficacy, an exceptionally high dosage, repeated application, or a particularly feeble opponent is required.
