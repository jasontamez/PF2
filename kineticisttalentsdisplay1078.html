Element universal; Type utility (Sp); Level 3; Burn 0
Saving Throw Will negates; SR yes
You use your element to halt a creature associated with your element, as hold monster except it requires concentration to maintain, and it works only on creatures with a subtype matching one of your elements (for example, a pyrokineticist could use it on creatures of the fire subtype). At any time, you can accept 1 point of burn to remove the need to concentrate.
