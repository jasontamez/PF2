Description

This translucent longsword was first forged by Jistkan elemental binders. It appears to have a blade crafted from solid wind, similar in appearance to the matter that makes up an air elemental's body. It functions as a +2 longsword. Three times per day, when the wielder confirms a critical hit with a sword of tempests, as an immediate action he can will a fraction of the blade to break off and transform into a Medium air elemental (this does not affect the sword itself). The elemental fights as the wielder directs for 7 rounds, or until it is destroyed. At the GM's discretion, similar weapons may exist that summon elementals from different planes.
