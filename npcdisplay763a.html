Both archers and diplomats, monastic snipers consider a well-placed warning shot the ideal method to open the channels of diplomacy from a position of power.

Tourindall Andarael

Many elves defend their enclaves with both well-placed arrows and honeyed words. Tourindall uses those same tactics to defend his fellow monks and their home. When strangers enter his order's lands, Tourindall is sent to spy on them and possibly warn them away.

Combat Encounters: Tourindall negotiates his way out of a fight if he can. If battle breaks out but negotiation still seems feasible, he disarms a single foe then offers to parley, or gets away to drink his potion of glibnessbefore returning to talk.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Tourindall is proud of his knowledge of both history and religion, and comes off as overly academic. He often weaves into his negotiations proverbs and myths from a variety of religions.
