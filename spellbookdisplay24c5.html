This pair of lexicons is covered in excellently preserved human skin, with an intricate lace of fingerbones forming the locks on the cover. A family seal has been embossed on the lower center of the cover, but flecks of gold leaf have begun to peel away, revealing that the embossed pattern in fact follows a faded tattoo on the skin itself.
Opposition Enchantment, illusion
Protection A series of three superior locks each augmented with arcane lock (DC 50) and a symbol of weakness (Fortitude DC 20) on the second page of each book.
Value 7,635 gp ( gp with the preparation ritual)
