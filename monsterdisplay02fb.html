Special Abilities

Entropic Flesh (Ex) Any creature that hits a sceaduinar with a melee attack takes 1d6 points of negative energy damage. Attacking with a weapon that provides reach allows a creature to avoid taking this damage.

Entropic Touch (Ex) A sceaduinar's natural attacks can strike incorporeal creatures as if they were ghost touch weapons. All of a sceaduinar's natural attacks deal +1d6 points of negative energy damage to the target. This energy does not heal creatures healed by inflict spells.

Void Child (Ex) Sceaduinars are immune to effects that target souls (such as trap the soul) or require knowledge of a creature's identity (such as scrying). When one is slain, it cannot be restored to life by magic save by a miracle or wish, or by divine intervention.

Description

Sceaduinars are strange creatures born of pure entropy, the antithesis of creation and life. In the cold heart of the Negative Energy Plane, the un-substance of that realm coalesces into snowflake-like crystals, and it is from these strange formations that sceaduinars arise, breaking free from their jagged "eggs" fully grown. They hate the living and the undead with equal passion, perhaps out of jealousy for those who have a spark of life (even if that spark is provided by a corruption of life in the form of undeath), though they usually ignore creatures from the Outer Sphere. They believe their positive energy counterparts, the jyoti, long ago stole their ability to create, breaking the parallel between the two energy planes and forcing these void-dwellers into an unwanted role of pure destruction.

In a way, their hatred parallels that of another native of the Negative Energy Plane-the nightshade. Yet despite their similar goals, the sceaduinars see nightshades as just another corruption of life worthy of destruction-even though very few sceaduinars are powerful enough to directly oppose one of these deadly undead. Sceaduinars are quite intelligent, yet they have no real society to speak of. When they gather together, it is always to form a larger band to strike against a particularly dangerous foe.

Adventurers venturing into sceaduinar territory may encounter more skilled specimens in their ranks.

Geotrophos (CR +1): Sceaduinar geometrist-midwives seek out the irregular crystalline angles likely to birth their race's young. They can reshape the solidified entropy around them in defense of these sites. A geotrophos is a sceaduinar with the <a href="monstertemplates3b26.html?ItemName=Advanced">advanced simple template</a>, an Intelligence score of at least 17, and the ability to cast <a href="spelldisplayf171.html?ItemName=stone%20call">stone call</a> three times per day.

Shardsinger (CR +1): These eerie entertainers seek out interesting sounds to fill the silence of the Void. Lacking the spark for original composition, they study the songs of void-ravaged harpies, wailing undead, and the cries of dying humanoids. A shardsinger is a sceaduinar with the <a href="monstertemplates3b26.html?ItemName=Advanced">advanced simple template</a>, a Charisma score of at least 21, and the ability to cast <a href="spelldisplayf219.html?ItemName=enthrall">enthrall</a> (DC 17) three times per day.

Splinter Twin (CR +2) Some particularly gnarled and mathematically unlikely aggregations of crystals fail to shatter into discrete sceaduinar individuals. The conjoined monstrosities spawned sport second heads, extra limbs, and other strange combinations of features. A splinter twin is a sceaduinar with the <a href="monstertemplates3b26.html?ItemName=Advanced">advanced</a> and <a href="monstertemplates1d95.html?ItemName=Giant">giant simple templates</a>, <a href="featdisplayf1a1.html?ItemName=Critical%20Focus">Critical Focus</a> as a bonus feat, and the ability to make one extra bite attack per round.

Void Hunter (CR +1): Implacable stalkers of undead, void hunters turn their talents against the living, too. A void hunter is a sceaduinar with the <a href="monstertemplates3b26.html?ItemName=Advanced">advanced simple template</a>, a Dexterity score of at least 24, and a +4 <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">favored enemy bonus</a> against either humanoids (humans) or undead.

Wing Leader (CR +1): To survive in the Void, death squad captains must be canny tacticians and living whirlwinds in combat. A wing leader is a sceaduinar with the <a href="monstertemplates3b26.html?ItemName=Advanced">advanced simple template</a>, a Strength score of at least 21, and <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a> and <a href="featdisplay6916.html?ItemName=Spring%20Attack"></a> as bonus feats.
