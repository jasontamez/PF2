Through discipline and training, an ironskin monk hardens his body to withstand punishing blows. Though slow on his feet, his calloused hands and feet can shatter stone and stagger foes.

Iron Skin (Ex):  At 1st level, an ironskin monk gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus stacks with any existing natural armor the ironskin monk already has. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1. This ability replaces the monk's AC bonus ability and the ability to add his Wisdom bonus to his AC.

Bonus Feat:  At 1st level, an ironskin monk adds Power Attack to his list of bonus feats. At 6th level, he adds Improved Sunder to the list. At 10th level, he adds Greater Sunder to the list. These bonus feat choices replace Dodge, Mobility, and Spring Attack on his bonus feat list.

Resilience (Ex):  At 2nd level, an ironskin monk can shake off the physical effects of certain attacks. If he makes a Fortitude saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can be used only if the monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefits of resilience. This ability replaces evasion.

Ki Pool (Su):  At 4th level, an ironskin monk can spend 1 point from his ki pool to gain a damage bonus equal to 1/2 his level against objects and constructs for 1 round. This replaces the ability to increase speed with ki.

Staggering Blow (Ex):  At 5th level, an ironskin monk attacking with an unarmed strike can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a free action after a successful critical hit to stagger the creature struck for 1 round (Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the ironskin monk's level + the ironskin monk's Wisdom modifier negates). This ability replaces high jump.

Tough as Nails (Ex):  At 6th level, an ironskin monk gains DR 1/-. Subtract 1 point from the damage the ironskin monk takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. This damage reduction increases by 1 point at 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. This ability replaces fast movement and slow fall.

Evasion (Ex):  At 9th level, an ironskin monk gains evasion. This ability replaces improved evasion.

Surefooted (Ex):  At 17th level, an ironskin monk's speed is not reduced by difficult terrain. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.

Unbreakable (Ex):  At 20th level, an ironskin monk sets aside many of the frailties of mortal flesh. He becomes immune to death effects and stunning. He is not subject to ability damage or ability drain, and has a 75% chance of ignoring the extra damage dealt by critical hits and sneak attacks. This ability replaces perfect self.
