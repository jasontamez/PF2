Description

This dark, hooded robe has six long,
silvery, razor-sharp needles protruding
from the bottom of its loose sleeves,
three on each side. The wearer can launch
one needle as a ranged touch attack. The
needle counts as a thrown weapon with a
range increment of 10 feet. If the needle
hits, it embeds itself in the target's flesh,
dealing 1 point of piercing damage and 1
point of bleed damage. A creature can pull out the needle as
a full-round action, which ends the bleed effect. The needle
is destroyed if an attack with it misses or when it is removed
from a creature it was embedded in. The robe regrows all
spent needles each morning.
