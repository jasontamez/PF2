Description

A single dose of oozeclot unguent can be applied to a 5-foot-square surface, whereupon it remains potent for 24 hours or until an ooze comes in contact with it. An ooze that crawls onto a surface treated with oozeclot unguent must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become immobile as its amorphous body grows rigid. As long as it is thus affected, the ooze can take no physical actions. Any amount of damage causes the hardened shell surrounding the ooze to crack, allowing the creature to slither out and resume attacks; otherwise it remains immobile for an extended period of time. An ooze of CR 3 or less is immobile for 1 week, while an ooze of CR 4 to CR 6 remains immobile for only 1d6 days. A CR 7 to CR 11 ooze is rendered immobile only for 1d6 rounds, and it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each round to end the effect early. Oozes of CR 12 or higher are immune to the effects of oozeclot unguent entirely.
