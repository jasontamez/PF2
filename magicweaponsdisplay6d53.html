Description

This +2 scythe has a handle carved of bone and topped with a single onyx gem. Once per day when the wielder of the weapon confirms a critical hit against a foe, she can command the blade to release a wave of soul-stealing power. All enemies within a 10-foot-radius burst of the wielder must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or gain 1 temporary negative level. After 1 hour, these temporary negative levels disappear automatically without requiring a saving throw. This ability is not triggered by a critical hit against a helpless or unaware creature or a creature that has a number of Hit Dice less than half the wielder's total Hit Dice.
