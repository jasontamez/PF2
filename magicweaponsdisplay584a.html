Description

This  human-bane light crossbow has a gold-colored metal lath and a keyhole-shaped slot for the bolt to rest in. The wielder gains a foot enhancement bonus to his base speed. The church of Abadar typically commissions fugitive finders to aid officials in chasing down and capturing escaped criminals, but Abadarans also craft variants that have the merciful special ability instead of human-bane, giving the wielder a better opportunity to capture a fleeing target alive.
