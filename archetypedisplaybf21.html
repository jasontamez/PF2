For a possessed shaman, merely communing with the spirit world is insufficient. Instead, she invites the spirits to share her body, granting them the chance to experience corporeal existence. In return, they grant her their skills and protect her from otherworldly influence.

Shared Skill (Su):  At 1st level, a possessed shaman selects two skills. Both of these skills must use the same ability score. The possessed shaman treats these skills as if she had a number of ranks in them equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skills would normally use. If either of the skills are class skills, she receives the usual +3 bonus on those skill checks for having ranks in those skills. These ranks do not stack with her other skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks applies). This ability replaces spirit magic.

Crowded Vessel (Su):  At 2nd level, whenever a possessed shaman fails a saving throw against a charm or compulsion spell or effect, she can attempt a new saving throw (using the original DC) at the end of her next turn as the spirits inside her attempt to regain control. If the saving throw is successful, the charm or compulsion effect ends. If the saving throw fails, she is affected as normal for the remainder of the duration. This ability replaces the hex gained at 2nd level.

Wandering Skills (Su):  At 6th level, a possessed shaman is able to make room for another spirit. When choosing her wandering spirit for the day, the possessed shaman chooses one skill. The possessed shaman treats this skill as if she had a number of ranks in it equal to her shaman level, and uses her Wisdom modifier in place of the ability modifier the skill would normally use. If the skill is a class skill, she receives the usual +3 bonus on skill checks for having ranks in that skill. Each time the possessed shaman changes her wandering spirit, she can also change the skill gained through this ability. These ranks do not stack with her other skill ranks (only the higher number of ranks applies). This ability replaces the wandering hex gained at 6th level.
