Description

Only the most trusted of servants are given the position of a vampire's coffin guard. This mortal stands watch over the vampire while his master is resting.

The coffin guard isn't just tasked with protecting his master. He snatches corpses and ingredients required for the vampire's workings. He knows where to find many ingredients in the woods, away from the prying eyes of the city folk, though he's not afraid to coerce those same city-dwellers into doing his bidding for him.

A vampire often needs mortal minions-especially during the day, when it must retreat to its coffin for safety.
