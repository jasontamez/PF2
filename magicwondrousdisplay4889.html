Description

This iron disk hangs from an iron chain, and is inscribed with an inverted pentagram and decorated around its outer edge with tiny metal barbs. When worn, it provides a +1 deflection bonus to AC.

If Asmodeus is the wearer's patron, the pentacle counts as an unholy symbol. By holding it and speaking a command word, the wearer can use charm person once per day. If the wearer squeezes the pentacle so its barbs draw her blood (dealing 1 point of damage), the wearer can use that blood as ink, writing with a quill or even a finger for up to 1 hour. The blood-ink dries instantly on writing surfaces so it never smudges, and if it's used as part of a magical spell the wearer casts that requires or is augmented by writing (such as magic circle against evil or sepia snake sigil), the DC of that spell increases by 1.
