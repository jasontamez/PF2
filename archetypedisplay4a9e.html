First World Caller

Some wizards, typically First World gnomes, have mystical ties with the First World, the primordial home of the fey. This bond allows them to more easily conjure creatures and effects from the First World, giving them the nickname of First World callers.

Fey Familiar: A First World caller must select a familiar as his arcane bond. This familiar is often the fey creature that was created when the First World caller's soul passed through the First World on the way to being born. The familiar counts as both an animal and a fey for the purposes of effects that depend on its type, rather than counting as a magical beast. It gains only half the normal natural armor bonus for a familiar based on the First World caller's level (rounded down, minimum 0), and it doesn't grant its special familiar ability to its master. Instead, the familiar gains the fey-touched creature template (see sidebar). At 10th level, the familiar grows a pair of delicate, gossamer wings, gaining a fly speed equal to its land speed and average maneuverability. If the familiar could already fly, its maneuverability improves by one step instead.

This alters arcane bond.

Fey Summoner: A First World caller is able to conjure fey creatures. He gains <a href="featdisplayc78d.html?ItemName=Augment%20Summoning">Augment Summoning</a> as a bonus feat. He adds the following creatures to the <a href="spelldisplay4aa5.html?ItemName=summon%20monster"><a href="spelldisplay073d.html?ItemName=Summon%20Monster">summon monster</a></a> list of the same level, allowing him to summon them with the appropriate <a href="spelldisplay073d.html?ItemName=Summon%20Monster">summon monster</a> spell: 1st-grimple (gremlin), mite, sprite; 2nd-atomie, fuath (gremlin), nixie; 3rd- leprechaun, nuglub (gremlin), pooka; 4th-kelpie, korred, twigjack; 5th-lampad, lurker in light, swan maiden; 6th-cold rider, oceanid, sangoi; 7th-alp, bogeyman, ijiraq; 8th-banelight, fastachee, rusalka; 9th-ankou, kamaitachi, wild hunt archer.

This ability is a function of the First World caller himself, and it applies even if he uses a scroll, wand, or other magic item to cast a <a href="spelldisplay073d.html?ItemName=Summon%20Monster">summon monster</a> spell. If he creates such an item and it is used by another character, the spell functions as an ordinary <a href="spelldisplay073d.html?ItemName=Summon%20Monster">summon monster</a> spell.

This replaces arcane school and Scribe Scroll.

Warp Reality (Su): At 10th level, a First World caller can reshape the nearby area at his whim, as he pulls in aspects of the mutable and primal First World. To use this ability, he must expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher as a standard action and succeed at a DC 15 Charisma check. If he succeeds, he can apply one of the following planar traits to the area in a 60-foot radius for 2d4 minutes: normal gravity, heavy gravity, light gravity, mildly aligned (chaos, evil, good, or law), enhanced magic, or impeded magic. At 15th level, he can instead expend a slot of 7th level or higher and attempt a DC 20 Charisma check. If successfully, he can apply two planar traits from the previous list, or any one of the following traits: no gravity, subjective directional gravity, erratic time, fire-dominant, water-dominant, negative-dominant, positive-dominant, or wild magic. See page 58 of Pathfinder RPG Planar Adventures for more information on planar traits.

This replaces the bonus feats gained at 10th and 15th level.
