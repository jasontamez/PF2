You can use your body as an implement to focus spells.

Prerequisites: Caster level 5th, <a href="classdisplay9cb4.html?ItemName=Occultist">implements class feature, mental focus class feature</a>, <a href="racesdisplay6f1b.html?ItemName=Wyrwood">wyrwood</a>.

Benefit: You can invest mental focus in your body rather than an implement. When you invest mental focus this way, you treat your body as an implement of any implement school you know. You do not gain the resonant power for the chosen school, but you treat your occultist level as 1 higher for the purposes of that school's focus powers. You can change which implement school is tied to your body when you invest your chosen implements for the day.
