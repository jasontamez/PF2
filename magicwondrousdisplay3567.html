Description

A tangled layer of green moss grown on a thin, damp sheet of sod, this heavy cloak can be wrapped around the wearer to provide a measure of camouflage. When donned in forest or jungle terrain, a moss cloak gives its wearer a +10 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In any terrain, the wearer can remove a single poison currently affecting him once per day as a standard action. This causes the moss to turn a sickly shade of brown as it draws the toxins from the wearer's body, negating the Stealth bonus until the cloak heals itself 24 hours later.
