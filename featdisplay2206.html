You gain an additional focus power from your implements.

Prerequisites: Focus power class feature.

Benefit:  You gain one additional focus power from among those available from your chosen implement schools. You must select a power for which you normally qualify.

Special:  You can choose this feat once for every implement school you know, up to a maximum of seven times at 18th level. Each time you do, you must choose a different focus power. If you have selected the same implement school more than once, you can select a focus power from that school once for each time you selected that school.
