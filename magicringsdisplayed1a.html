Description

This lustrous gold ring is highly malleable and always fits perfectly. After being worn for 24 hours, the ring allows the wearer to resize one weapon or suit of armor to her size. The ring can affect any item that is no more than two size categories too big or too small and that weighs no more than 125 pounds. The size change lasts until 1 round after the item leaves the wearer's possession. A new item can be resized after it has been in the wearer's possession for 24 hours, causing the previously resized item to return to its normal size. The resizing otherwise functions as the resize item spell.
