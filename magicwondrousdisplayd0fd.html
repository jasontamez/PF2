Description

Named for the goddess of piracy, strife, and sea monsters, this figurehead must be mounted on the prow of a ship function. Once per day, a ship carrying Besmara's Bones can inflict a curse on an enemy ship struck with a successful ramming attack. The target ship must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or its pilot takes a -4 penalty on Profession (sailor) checks to control the ship. In addition, the cursed ship can never gain the upper hand in ship-to-ship combat (Skull & Shackles Player's Guide 9). The curse inflicted by the figurehead cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish spell. In addition, once per day, Besmara's Bones can be used to cast false life (CL 5th) on the captain of the ship carrying the figurehead. A ship may not have more than one figurehead, magical or otherwise, mounted on it at one time.
