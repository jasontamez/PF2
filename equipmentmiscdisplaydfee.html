Description

A smuggler's wagon functions in most respects exactly like an ordinary wagon (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 87), except it contains hidden compartments that allow for cargo to be transported in secret. The price of a smuggler's wagon depends on two factors-the size or type of the original wagon, and the skill with which the hidden compartments have been constructed. The table below details the prices of such a vehicle (the numbers in parentheses indicate the DC for a Perception check to successfully locate the hidden compartments during a search of the wagon).
<table class="inner"> <tr><td colspace="4">Concealment Quality</td></tr> <tr><td>Size</td><td>Low (15)</td><td>Med. (20)</td><td>High (25)</td></tr> <tr><td>Light</td><td>75 gp</td><td>100 gp</td><td>150 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>Medium</td><td>115 gp</td><td>150 gp</td><td>225 gp</td></tr> <tr><td>Heavy</td><td>150 gp</td><td>200 gp</td><td>300 gp</td></tr></table>
Compartments can be located throughout the wagon, in such places as a hollowed-out axle, beneath the seats, between panels on the floor decking, and so forth. The total amount of weight the wagon and its draft animals can accommodate remains the same as the original variety of wagon.
