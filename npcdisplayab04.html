Gamblers lounge in dark corners of taverns and gambling dens, using their keen wits and talents to make a living.

Meliski Traundor

Though he usually seems half drunk, Meliski's inebriation is only an act. This deception puts his opponents at ease, making them think he's an easy mark. They later discover he led them right into his trap when he takes all their gold by the end of the night. He knows all the tricks to spot when someone else is cheating.

Posted at a tavern table surrounded by a mug of beer, a stack of cards, and a worn bag of coin, Meliski outdrinks most other patrons. He plays cards all night, until the barkeep timidly begs him to leave so he can close up.

Combat Encounters: Never one to suffer cheaters lightly, Meliski doesn't back down from a fight when cards are involved.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Meliski is always found in a bar, gambling the night away. He welcomes new players, but brushes off anyone who doesn't ante up.
