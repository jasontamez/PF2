Dryads trust you to bear their power and their bond.

Prerequisites: Cha 15, <a href="featdisplay4156.html?ItemName=Dryad%e2%80%99s%20Apprentice">Dryad's Apprentice</a>, character level 9th, <a href="racesdisplay489d.html?ItemName=Gathlain">gathlain</a>.

Benefit: You can cast <a href="spelldisplaya3a0.html?ItemName=meld%20into%20stone">meld into stone</a> as a spell-like ability once per day with a caster level equal to your character level, except that you instead meld with wood. You can remain melded with the wood for up to 24 hours. If you meld with a <a href="monsterdisplayb6e2.html?ItemName=Dryad">dryad's</a> bonded tree, the dryad can treat you as her bonded tree for a number of days equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) after you leave it; the dryad retains her bond to her tree during this time as well.
