Description

This simple, rosy liquid smells of fresh flowers and perfume. For 1 hour after drinking this tincture, you gain a +2 alchemical bonus on Diplomacy checks, and if you fail a Diplomacy check to shift a creature's attitude by 5 or more, the creature's attitude toward you doesn't worsen. The increased pheromone production makes it difficult to think, causing you take a -2 penalty on Intelligence-based skill checks for the same duration. Additionally, creatures with the scent ability can detect you from twice as far away for the same duration.
