Description

This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm.
When this is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon,
but can be removed from that weapon with a full-round
action. A firearm wielder can choose to spend a fullround
action to make a single shot with a firearm that
has this sight. When she does, she can resolve the attack
against the touch AC of her target regardless of the range
increment.
