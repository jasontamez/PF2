Different cities have different laws about such issues as carrying weapons in public and restricting spellcasters.

The city's laws might not affect all characters equally. A monk isn't hampered at all by a law about peace-bonding weapons, but a cleric is reduced to a fraction of his power if all holy symbols are confiscated at the city's gates.
