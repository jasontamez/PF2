Description

This pearl is worth at least 1,000 gp for its beauty alone, yet if it
is clasped firmly in hand or held to the breast while the possessor
attempts actions related to the pearl's powers, she understands
and is able to employ the item.


The pearl enables its possessor to breathe in water as if she
were in clean, fresh air. Her swim speed is 60 feet, and she can
cast spells and act underwater without hindrance.
