Description

Poppets resemble humanoid mannequins standing 1 foot tall and weighing 6 pounds. Their faces have only the crudest features, if any at all.

Each poppet is connected to a wooden token as a part of its creation, typically shaped into a doll or piece of jewelry. The poppet follows orders given by the individual keyed to this token, so long as that individual carries or wears the token. The individual currently keyed to the token can give it to another-transferring control of the poppet-in a 1-minute ritual. This transfer is typical when a poppet is sold to a new owner.

Poppets have no minds of their own, and so carry out orders explicitly as they are instructed, even if their situation makes the command nonsensical. Poppets can only perform simple manual labor, but they can be commanded to perform simple tasks at certain times, or when certain conditions are met.

Construction

Poppets are among the simplest of constructs. The creator must start with quality pieces of wood and wicker worth 10 gp.

Humanoid in shape and constructed of base materials, poppets are designed to accompany explorers into dangerous places and help with simple tasks.


Poppet Variants

Poppets can be enhanced with a variety of abilities or built in a slightly larger size.

Poppet Augmentations

The following abilities can be added to a poppet at the time of creation or added later to a poppet under the crafter's control. Each augmentation is listed with the additional price to a buyer, as well as the additional requirements that a crafter must meet to produce the augmentation (in addition to the Craft Construct or Craft Poppet feat), followed by the additional cost to the crafter.

Unless otherwise stated, a poppet can gain each augmentation only once.
