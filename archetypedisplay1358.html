Silver Champion

Paladins who serve as priests of Apsu are almost always on the move, wandering from place to place and trying to show their dedication to the Waybringer in their deeds rather than depending on mere words. Good-aligned dragons are more likely to treat such paladins as they would treat other dragons (though perhaps not with the respect reserved for other true dragons), and evil dragons often target them as special threats.

More rarely a drake is so inspired by a paladin of Apsu that it chooses to assist the paladin in all her actions. These drake allies see the benefit of a silver champion remaining mobile and understand the powerful threats the champion must face, and in time even consent to serve their chosen paladins as a steed. Silver champions are often concerned by their drake allies' pragmatic natures, however, and are sure to treat them with respect, knowing that these lesser dragons must constantly be inspired to act on their better natures.


Deity: A silver champion must worship Apsu.


Drake Mount
: At 5th level, a silver champion gains a drake companion. If the drake companion is at least one size larger than the silver champion, it gains the mount drake power as a bonus power. However, a silver champion doesn't gain additional uses per day of smite evil at 4th, 10th, and 16th levels, and doesn't gain mercies at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels.

This ability replaces divine bond, channel energy, aura of justice, and aura of righteousness, and alters smite evil and mercy.


Dragon Magic
: The silver champion does not have access to the normal paladin spell list. She instead adds the 1stthrough 4th-level spells from the domains granted by Apsu (Artifice, Good, Law, Scalykind, Travel) and the god's associated subdomains (Archon, Construct, Dragon, Exploration, Toil, and Trade) to her class spell list. A silver champion casts one fewer spell of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to less than 0, she can't cast spells of that level.

This ability modifies the paladin's spellcasting.
