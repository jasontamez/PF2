The terrifying force of your croak disorients and debilitates your enemies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay657c.html?ItemName=Sonic%20Croak">Sonic Croak</a>, <a href="featdisplaya765.html?ItemName=Throat%20Pouch">Throat Pouch</a>, boggard, terrifying croak.

Benefit:  When you use your terrifying croak ability, instead of imparting its normal effect you can choose to stun one creature within 30 feet for 1 round. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save, it is instead staggered for 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is the same as that of your terrifying croak ability.
