Your first step in determining a region's baseline weather is to decide upon the region's climate. Climate is split up into one of three categories: cold, temperate and tropical. These types correspond to the three climate categories used in monster entries in all of the Pathfinder Bestiary volumes (note that a fourth category, extraplanar, is not a factor in determining weather for Material Plane worlds).

The baseline temperature range for each climate category is given below, and is further refined in <a href="rules7c82.html?Name=Temperature%20Variations%20and%20Precipitation&amp;Category=Weather%20in%20the%20Wilderness">Temperature Variations and Precipitation</a>. These baselines are also presented in Table 4-12.

Cold: A cold climate is found in the extreme northern or southern regions of the world at latitudes greater than 60 degrees (approximately 2,000 miles from a pole). In these polar regions, temperatures often remain below freezing throughout the majority of the year. The baseline temperature in this climate is cold, ranging from 20?? F in the winter, to 30?? F in the spring and fall months, and up to 40?? F in the summer. For regions within 500 miles of the pole, the baseline temperature is 10?? F colder than the seasonal average. For regions within 250 miles of the pole, the baseline temperature is 20?? F colder than the seasonal average. Because cold air tends to be drier than warm air, reduce the frequency and intensity of precipitation by one step in cold climates.

Temperate: Temperate climates stretch between the polar regions and tropical regions of the world, generally at latitudes between 60 degrees and 30 degrees. The baseline temperature in this climate ranges from 30?? F in winter, to 60?? F in spring and fall, and all the way up to 80?? F in summer. Precipitation frequency is not altered as a result of a temperate climate, but it can still be altered as a result of other factors such as the elevation or season (see below).

Tropical: The tropics exist to either side of the world's equator, extending north and south for about 30 degrees of latitude in either direction. Tropical regions tend to be warm and humid, with a baseline temperature ranging from 50?? F in winter, to 75?? F in spring and fall, and up to 95?? F in summer. Because warm, humid air produces a great deal of precipitation, increase the frequency and intensity of precipitation by one step in this climate.
