Description

Upon command, a breaking weapon deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against inanimate objects and crystalline creatures on a successful hit and ignores the hardness of objects with a hardness of 5 or lower. When used against a crystalline creature, the damage from this effect does not stack with bane or similar weapon special abilities. This effect remains until another command is given.
