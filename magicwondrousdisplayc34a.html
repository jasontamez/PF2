Description

These black leather gloves feel like warm, living skin to the touch. When the wearer delivers a coup de grace that kills an opponent, she can target a single creature within 30 feet that has died within the previous 3 rounds as a free action. The target creature is healed as if with a breath of life spell (regaining 5d8+9 hit points), and if the creature's hit point total is then greater than a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total. As with the breath of life spell, creatures brought back to life gain a temporary negative level that lasts for 1 day, but this effect can save creatures slain by death effects. This effect cannot damage undead creatures. The opponent killed by the coup de grace must have a number of Hit Dice equal to or greater than the target slain creature's Hit Dice or the gloves' ability is not triggered.
