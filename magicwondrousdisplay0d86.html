Description

A frontovik’s gas mask has the
appearance of a typical Zelinsky-
Kummant gas mask used by the
Russian army: a rubberized cloth bag
worn over the face, with two thick
glass eyepieces and a rectangular
filter canister (see page 67). Named
for the frontovik, the typical combat-hardened
veteran of the front
line, a frontovik’s gas mask allows its wearer to breathe
freely, even underwater or in a vacuum, as well as making
its wearer immune to harmful gases and vapors, including
inhaled diseases, poisons, and magic spells such as cloudkill
and stinking cloud. In addition, the wearer can see through
magical and normal clouds, fogs, mists, and similar effects
that grant concealment, but only so long as the wearer is
within the area of such concealment. A frontovik’s gas mask
does not grant any other kind of vision (such as darkvision or
low-light vision). Wearing a gas mask imposes a –2 penalty on
hearing- and sight-based Perception checks.
