Illusive Gnome Style (Combat, Style)

The chaotic, somewhat random design of your racial weapons makes it easy to combine them with illusions.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplay6c39.html?ItemName=Gnome%20Weapon%20Focus">Gnome Weapon Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplayed67.html?ItemName=Improved%20Feint">Improved Feint</a>, base attack bonus +1, gnome magic and weapon familiarity racial traits.

Benefit:  While feinting with a melee weapon that has "gnome" in its name, you can sacrifice a spell slot, a spell of the illusion school, or a spell from the gnome magic racial trait to gain a bonus on the skill check attempted to feint. This bonus is equal to 1 + the level of the spell sacrificed. If you sacrifice a 0-level spell, you cannot cast or sacrifice that spell again for 24 hours.
