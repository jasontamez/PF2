Water (Elemental School)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 143</a>
The water elementalist draws magic from the ocean depths. His power is fluid as well, crushing foes in mighty waves or wearing them down through timeless erosion.

Water Supremacy (Su): You gain a +2 enhancement bonus on Swim skill checks. This bonus increases by +1 for every five wizard levels you possess. In addition, you can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to four times your Constitution score before you must start making checks to avoid drowning. At 10th level, you gain a swim speed equal to your base speed. At 20th level, whenever you make a Swim skill check, assume the roll resulted in a natural 20.

Cold Blast (Su): As a standard action, you can unleash a blast of freezing cold. This blast deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two wizard levels you possess to all creatures within 5 feet of you and staggers them for 1 round. A successful Reflex save negates the staggered effect and halves the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Wave (Su): At 8th level, you can create a wave of water that starts at your location and moves 30 feet per round away from you in a direction of your choosing. Creatures struck by the wave might be knocked down and pushed away. Make a caster level check against the CMD of each creature struck. If you succeed, the creature is knocked prone. If your check exceeds the CMD of the creature by 5 or more, it is carried with the wave during the wave's movement this round. You receive a +5 bonus on this check if the creature shares its space with the wave at the start of your turn (when the wave moves). Creatures carried in this way can move out of the wave on their turn if they succeed on a Strength check (DC = 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Intelligence modifier), but they cannot breathe while sharing space with the wave. The wave is up to 20 feet high and up to 5 feet long for each wizard level you possess. Nonmagical fires hit by the wave are automatically extinguished. Magical fire effects are unaffected. You can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 1/2 your wizard level.

Ice School

Associated School: Air or Water.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the lightning flash and cyclone powers of the air school and the cold blast and wave powers of the water school.

Freezing Shards (Su): As a standard action, you can cause shards of ice to burst forth from the ground around you. The shards deal 1d4 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every 2 wizard levels you have to all creatures within 5 feet of you. A successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) negates the piercing damage and halves the cold damage. The shards remain until the beginning of your next turn; during this time, the area is difficult terrain. You are not affected by your own freezing shards and can move through the area normally. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Icy Shackles (Su): At 8th level, as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack against a foe to conjure icy restraints around its ankles, reducing its base speed to 5 feet and dealing it an amount of cold damage at the beginning of its turn equal to your Intelligence modifier. The manacles have AC 10, hardness 0, and 30 hit points, and a creature can destroy them with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + half your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) as a standard action. The icy shackles melt away after 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Mud School

Associated School: Earth or Water.

Replacement Powers: The following school powers replace the acid cloud and earth glide powers of the earth school and the cold blast and wave powers of the water school.

Hindering Muck (Su): As a standard action, you can create a 15-foot cone of sticky mud. Any creature in the cone must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier) or become entangled for 1 round for every wizard level you have. An affected creature can take a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity to wipe off enough of the mud to remove the entangled condition. Jumping into a large body of water or being subject to an effect that creates a substantial amount of water (such as a casting of create water) removes all the mud on a creature. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier.

Mud Missile (Su): At 8th level, you can fling a ball of hardened mud at a foe within 30 feet as a standard action. If you succeed at a ranged touch attack, the mud slams into the target's face, dealing 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 wizard levels you have and blinding the target for 1d4 rounds. A creature can remove the blinding mud from itself or another creature with a successful Strength check (DC = 10 + half your wizard level) as a standard action. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half your wizard level.
