A derro magister's mind is particularly affected by the consumption of strange mold, granting enhanced resistance to magic and additional spell-like abilities and traits.

Prerequisites: Cha 20, derro.

Benefit: A derro magister's spell resistance equals the derro's Hit Dice +10. Heal is always a class skill for a derro magister, and it gains a +4 racial bonus on all Heal checks.

A derro with this feat treats its caster level for all spell-like abilities as equal to his Hit Dice. In addition, as soon as a derro with this feat achieves a total of 6 Hit Dice by gaining enough levels in any combination of classes, it gains the use of additional spell-like abilities as detailed below.
