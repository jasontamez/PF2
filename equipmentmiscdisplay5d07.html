Description

Goblins pickle everything, and thus goblin pickles can be composed of almost anything. Their only shared characteristic is that they're mostly edible. At the GM's discretion, a non-goblin who eats a goblin pickle must make a DC 10 Fortitude save to avoid being sickened for 1 hour. A single jar of goblin pickles provides a goblin enough nourishment for a day.
