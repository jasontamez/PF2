Description

This weapon has a blade concealed between the two halves of the handle that can be brought to bear quickly. If you are proficient with it (or have the Quick Draw feat), you may open it as a free action; a nonproficient user must spend a move action to open it. Otherwise, treat it as a dagger. When it's closed, you gain a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal it on your body.
