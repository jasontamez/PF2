This armor or shield is brightly polished, and its mirrorbright surface is magically endowed with the ability to bring comfort to the wearer's companions. Allies within 30 feet of the wearer gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the wearer has an ability that grants a morale bonus on saving throws against fear (such as a paladin's aura of courage, a bard's countersong, or a cavalier's banner ability), the morale bonus increases to +6.
