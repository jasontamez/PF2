Bloodline Powers: Your bloodline grants a number of resistances and changes your form to something angelic and terrible to behold when you bloodrage.

Angelic Attacks (Su): At 1st level, your melee attacks are considered good-aligned weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Furthermore, when you deal damage with a melee attack to an evil outsider, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This additional damage stacks with effects such as <a href="spelldisplayefac.html?ItemName=align%20weapon">align weapon</a> and those granted by a weapon with the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay86e5.html?ItemName=Holy">holy</a> weapon special ability.

Celestial Resistances (Ex): At 4th level, you gain resistance 5 to acid and cold. At 12th level, these resistances increase to 10.

Conviction (Su): At 8th level, once per bloodrage you can reroll one ability check, skill check, or saving throw you just made. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the GM reveals the results. You must take the second result, even if it's worse.

Wings of Heaven (Su): At 12th level, you can choose to sprout feathery wings and fly with a speed of 60 feet and good maneuverability. At 20th level, your fly speed increases to 80 feet.

Angelic Protection (Su): At 16th level, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. In addition, you are affected as if subject to a <a href="spelldisplay7820.html?ItemName=Protection%20from%20evil">protection from evil</a> spell. This effect cannot be dispelled.

Ascension (Su): At 20th level, you become infused with the power of the heavens. You gain immunity to acid, cold, and petrification. You also gain resistance 10 to electricity and fire, as well as a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. You have these benefits constantly, even while not bloodraging.
