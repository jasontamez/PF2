<a href="phrenicamplificationsdisplay5c99.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Defense">Psychic Defense</a> (Su) (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 13</a>): Reading small, invisible cues allows the psychic to take advantage of social circumstances and subtly influence her target. Casting a linked spell during a social encounter and spending 1 point from her phrenic pool allows the psychic to add a +4 bonus on her next Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check.
