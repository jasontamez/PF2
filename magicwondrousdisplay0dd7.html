Description

From this cup poured the poison that killed the Caliph of the Djinn. According to a djinn fable, the Caliph berated the cup for failing to warn him of the treachery, and so abashed was the vessel that it swore from that time on to warn if it was ever again filled with poison.

The storied cup is a golden chalice decorated with scenes of the djinn court. If a poisonous liquid is poured into the cup the images change from those of friendly discourse to impressions of angry fighting. A character unaware of this property must make a DC 20 Spot check to notice the sudden change.
