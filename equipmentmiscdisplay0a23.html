Description

A footman is a house servant in good physical shape, who is dressed in his employer's livery and capable of running ahead of his employer to make arrangements at a destination (such as an inn or a noble's mansion). This is a position of lesser rank than a valet, and is often a status symbol for the employer, with taller or better-looking employees earning higher wages as footmen. A skilled and personable footman can hope to eventually become a valet. The listed price is per day.
