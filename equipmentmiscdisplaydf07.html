Description

This specialized magnet straps onto a gauntlet and is powerful enough to attract metal even through leather or cloth. A gauntlet magnet provides a +2 bonus to your CMD against disarm attempts while holding a magnetic metal weapon, shield, or item (such as one made from steel or iron). It also provides a +1 bonus on disarm attempts made with the gauntlet against magnetic objects. Attaching one of these magnets to a gauntlet or removing it is a full-round action.
