In the wound thresholds variant, a character divides her hit point total into four quarters, and takes penalties whenever she's not in her top quarter. A character at 3/4 of her maximum hit points is less effective than one at full hit points, one at 1/2 is less effective than one at 3/4, and so on.

To prevent the need to divide on the fly, start out by calculating 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 of your total hit points and add them to your character sheet as "Grazed (-1)," "Wounded (-2)," and "Critical (-3)." If you have a Constitution bonus of +1 or higher, also write down the negative of your Constitution bonus next to the word "Disabled." These terms indicate the conditions a character gains as her hit points drop. For example, a 7th-level sorcerer with a maximum of 71 hit points would become grazed at 53 hit points, wounded at 35 hit points, and critical at 17 hit points. If she had a Constitution score of 12, she would be disabled if she had 0 or -1 hit points, and would start dying at -2 hit points. As usual, she would die when her hit points drop to -12 or lower.
