When an arcanist is on a plane other than the Material Plane, she can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as part of casting a spell that summons a single outsider native to that plane. If she does so, the outsider's attacks bypass all types of DR that it has. For example, a nabasu demon, which has DR/cold iron or DR/good, would bypass both DR/cold iron and DR/good.
