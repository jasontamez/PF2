This panoply is associated with those who deceive as well as those who entertain.

Implements: Mask (illusion) and musical instrument (enchantment).

Resonant Power: Each time the occultist invests mental focus into all of the associated implements, the panoply grants the following resonant power. The panoply's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.

Actor's Skill (Su): The panoply grants a +1 bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Perform checks for every 3 points of total mental focus invested in all of the associated implements, to a maximum bonus equal to half the occultist's level. The panoply also grants an equal bonus on saving throws against divination effects.

Base Focus Power: All occultists who learn to use this panoply gain the following focus power.

False Persona (Su): By spending 1 minute in meditation and expending 2 points of mental focus, you can create a psychic mask that obscures your identity. When you create this false persona, you choose the nature of the persona's alignment and magical auras, and can create a simple background of up to four basic facts about the persona. All divination spells that reveal information about you instead reveal information based on the false persona's background and aura information. Additionally, attempts to scry or magically locate you work only if the creature making such attempts knows that you and your current false persona are the same individual. Otherwise, the spell has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you did not exist. This effect lasts up to 24 hours or until you next refresh your mental focus (whichever occurs first), though you can dismiss this false persona at any time before then as a fullround action. This effect fools only magical attempts to discern your identity or background, and has no effect on mundane means of gathering information about you.

Focus Powers: In addition to the base focus power, occultists who learn to use this panoply can select the following focus powers when choosing powers gained from their focus powers class feature.

False Confidence (Sp): By taking a standard action and expending 1 point of mental focus, you can instill incredible, boundless confidence in a single living creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet, granting that creature a +2 morale bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 10 minutes. As a move action, you can shatter the feeling of confidence, leaving the target feeling hopeless and distraught. If you do, the target can immediately attempt a Will save to negate the effect, with a cumulative -1 penalty for every 2 minutes the creature benefited from the morale bonus. If the target fails this save, it takes a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for the remainder of the effect's duration. If the creature then fails an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check by 10 or more while subject to this penalty, the penalty changes to -4.

Hypnotic Gaze (Sp): By taking a standard action and expending 1 point of mental focus, you can hypnotize a single creature within 60 feet that can see you. The target must succeed at a Will save or become fascinated for as long as you maintain the effect (a move action), plus 1 additional round. Fascinated creatures take a -1 penalty on Will saving throws. For every 3 rounds that you maintain the effect, this penalty increases by 1 to a maximum penalty of -4. Anything that ends the fascination effect also ends the penalty. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw to resist this effect is immune to that occultist's hypnotic gaze for 24 hours.

Puppet Master (Sp): By taking a standard action and expending 2 points of mental focus, you can implant a hypnotic suggestion in a creature. This functions as per suggestion (using your occultist level as the caster level), except that the saving throw DC is equal to 10 + half your occultist level + your Intelligence modifier, and if the target fails its saving throw, you can choose to have it forget everything that occurs while it is under the spell's effects, as well as any recollection of you using this ability on it. Memories forgotten in this way can be recovered with restoration or spells or effects that can restore lost memories (such as modify memory).
