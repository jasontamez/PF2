Elemental fire stirs within your body, boiling your blood and rendering you resistant to flame.

Prerequisites: Ifrit.

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against fire attacks and spells with the fire descriptor or light descriptor. As a swift action, you can make up to two held manufactured metallic weapons become red-hot for 1 round, dealing 1 additional point of fire damage with a successful hit. This does not stack with other effects that add fire damage to weapons, such as the flaming weapon special ability.

When you use this feat to make one or more metallic weapons red hot for 1 round, you can spend 2 stamina points to increase the additional fire damage to 2 points, and have that damage stack with other effects that add fire damage to a weapon (such as the flaming weapon special ability).
