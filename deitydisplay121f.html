Paladin Code

The paladins of Arqueros are defense-oriented generals and bodyguards of virtuous public figures and honorable clients. Their tenets include the following affirmations.<ul><li> I will never abandon an innocent in need of protection.</li><li> The role of guardian is a sacred one. I will never neglect my duties when I agree to guard or protect others, even if they seem unworthy of my protection.</li><li> A guardian is only as effective as his weapons and armor. I will maintain mine in peak condition at all times, repairing and cleaning them as consistently as possible without neglecting my charge.</li></ul>
