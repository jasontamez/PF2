Description

This standard gold coin typically has two blank faces, but its owner can cause the holy symbol of Desna-a butterfly with the sun, the moon, and stars on its wings-to appear on either face at will. This proves especially useful when performing coin flips, as the owner of a Desna's coin can essentially guarantee that the result will end up in her favor.

As one would expect of an item associated with the goddess of luck, a Desna's coin confers on its owner an uncanny ability to fortuitously avoid sudden threats. As a result, its bearer gains a +2 luck bonus on Reflex saving throws.
