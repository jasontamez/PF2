All of the fighter's allies are treated as if they had the same teamwork feats as the fighter for the purpose of determining whether the fighter receives a bonus from his teamwork feats. His allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually have the feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the fighter to receive the listed bonus.
