Special Abilities

No Shadow (Ex) A shadow collector casts no
shadow of its own, but instead casts any one of
the stolen shadows it possesses.

Steal Shadow (Su) A shadow collector
automatically steals the shadow of any
incorporeal or living creature destroyed, incapacitated,
or killed by its claw attack. A shadow collector can also steal
a living corporeal creature's shadow with the steal combat
maneuver; the shadow doesn't count as fastened to its owner. Until the
shadow is returned, the victim has no shadow or reflection
and gains 2 permanent negative levels. These negative levels
can't be removed otherwise, even with magic that usually
removes negative levels. When a shadow collector steals a
shadow, it gains 2 shadow points. A shadow collector must
expend 1 shadow point to use any of its spell-like abilities. A
shadow collector generally begins an encounter with 1d3+1
shadow points. A shadow collector can release a stolen
shadow as a standard action. A creature can touch the shadow
collector to regain its stolen shadow, as long as the shadow
collector is helpless or dead. A successful break enchantment
(DC 23) can also restore a target's shadow.

Tear Shadow (Su) A shadow collector's claws strike as ghost
touch weapons and, in addition to their normal damage,
deal 1d6 points of Charisma damage to incorporeal creatures.
This damage destroys a creature if it equals or exceeds the
creature's actual Charisma score.

Description

Shadow collectors feed on memories and regrets sifted
from shadows. They often weave mortal shadows into
certain magic items such as cloaks and gloves. Some
shadow collectors con mortals into selling their shadows
or resort to blatant theft; others prowl the Plane of Shadow
and the Ethereal Plane for shadows that are already lost.

Shadow collectors favor spaces like the edges
of forests and foothills for the varied
lighting and for the numerous places
where they can flank marks from
hiding or surprise them with pits
created by shadow conjuration.

A typical shadow collector
stands over 3 feet tall and weighs
40 pounds.
