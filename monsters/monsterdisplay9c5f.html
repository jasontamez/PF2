Special Abilities

Repartee (Su) Three times per day, when a liminal sprite
successfully aids another creature's Charisma-based skill
check, the creature gains a +2d4 bonus on the skill check
instead of the normal +2 bonus. A creature can receive this
bonus from only one liminal sprite per skill check.
Versatile Performance (Ex) A liminal sprite can use its bonus
for Perform (comedy) in place of its bonus for Bluff and
Intimidate. When substituting in this way, the liminal sprite
uses its total bonus for Perform (comedy), including any
class skill bonus, in place of the associated skill's total bonus,
whether or not it has ranks in Perform (comedy) or Perform
(comedy) is a class skill for the sprite.

Description

An ancestral curse hangs over liminal sprites that prevents
them from sleeping either inside a building or outside in
the open. Fortunately for these sprites, a loophole exists
that allows them to find rest within the external features
of a building. As a result, liminal sprites make their homes
under eaves, porches, and staircases.

Liminal sprites are fascinated by the arts, philosophy,
and social intrigues of humanoids, which they experience
vicariously from their hiding places, and with which they
are often moved to interfere. They use their magic to bind
the tongues of the witty and steal thoughts from the wise,
returning them only after the moment in which they would
have been useful has passed, thus adding insult to injury.

The sprites must be subtle, however, lest their unwitting
hosts turn against them. They especially fear domestic
animals turned loose near their hideaways. On the other
hand, a homeowner who appeases the sprite with flattery
and gifts finds his own eloquence improved. A 7th-level
chaotic spellcaster can gain a liminal sprite as a familiar
with the Improved Familiar feat, though she must take
pains to find her familiar a suitable place to rest each night.

Liminal sprites stand 1 to 1-1/2 feet tall, and their
mothlike wings stretch to a similar distance. Liminal
sprites follow the local fashions of their city, modeling
their clothes after those worn by nobles and celebrities.
