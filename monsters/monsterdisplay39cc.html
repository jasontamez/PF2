Description

Nearly 10 feet long, giant stag beetles become serious dangers when they wander into logging camps due to their appetite for decaying wood. Called stag beetles because of their large, antler-like mandibles, they use these appendages to wrestle competing suitors and quickly put down enemy threats.

Variant species of these giant beetles exist as well. The two detailed below are the ones most commonly encountered.
