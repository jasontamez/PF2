Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a pharmakos is able to spew a 50-foot cone of acidic blood, dealing 12d6 points of acid damage and imposing the nauseated condition for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 28 Reflex save halves the acid damage and negates the nauseated condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Curse of Eternal Torment (Su) A pharmakos's abhorrent form is the result of a powerful curse, usually inflicted by a god. This curse grants immortality; a pharmakos does not need to eat, drink, or breath to survive, and cannot die of old age-nor can a pharmakos willingly end its own life. This curse also constantly racks the pharmakos with agony; the creature endures this torment to an extent that all other sources of pain are meaningless (including those caused by magical effects such as a <a href="spelldisplay5a4f.html?ItemName=symbol%20of%20pain">symbol of pain</a>).

Pain (Su) Any creature struck by a pharmakos's claw or bite becomes racked with waves of pain. The victim takes 1d4 points of Strength damage. A confirmed critical hit deals 2d4 points of Strength damage instead, and also afflicts the target with agony that imposes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for as long as the victim endures any Strength damage from the pharmakos's pain attack. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save reduces the Strength damage to 1 point. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

When a worshiper of an evil god forsakes his faith, the deity being spurned sometimes takes note. In such a case, the betraying worshiper may not have the luxury of living the rest of his life and putting off divine punishment until some point after death. Sometimes, the god is so offended that the infidel is transformed into a pharmakos. While a pharmakos has much power, the metamorphosis into such a cursed creature is rarely one a worshiper seeks, for the pain and humiliation of the punishment is significant. That the altered worshiper can go on to serve the deity as a powerful guardian is of a secondary concern to the god in most cases, and regardless, when a pharmakos finally meets the end of its pain-filled life, then true divine punishment begins.
