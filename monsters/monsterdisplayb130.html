Special Abilities

Change Shape (Su) A skinwalker
can change shape to a bestial form
as a standard action. In bestial form,
a skinwalker gains a +2 racial bonus
to his choice of Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution. While in this form, a
skinwalker also takes on an animalistic
feature that provides a special effect.
Each time a skinwalker assumes bestial
form, he can choose to gain two claw attacks
that each deal 1d4 points of damage, 60 foot
darkvision, or a +1 natural armor bonus.
These benefits last until the skinwalker returns to his
humanoid form as a swift action. A skinwalker must first
return to his humanoid form before changing to bestial form
again to change benefits. The skinwalker presented here is
currently in bestial form, and has claw attacks and a +2 racial
bonus to Strength.

Description

Most people believe that skinwalkers are half-breeds
of lycanthropes, or that they possess a weaker version of
the curse of lycanthropy. However, skinwalker shamans
claim that their people were chosen by the gods as a bridge
between humanity and animals. Either way, skinwalkers
resemble humans much of the time, but they have the
uncanny ability to transform into bestial humanoids with
powerful and fearsome aspects of animals.
