The pile of bones suddenly stirs, rising up to take on a human shape. Its long, bony fingers reach out to claw at the living.

Description

A mythic skeleton is an animated corpse created with mythic magic such as mythic animate dead. It has an unnatural cunning that belies its mindless nature and a natural instinct for killing.

Creating a Mythic Skeleton

"Mythic skeleton" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with the skeleton template (referred to hereafter as the base skeleton).

Mythic Subtype: A mythic skeleton gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base skeleton. Instead of gaining additional abilities according to its CR, it always gains channel resistance +2, relentless, and superior two-weapon fighting. The mythic skeleton gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).

CR: Adjust the base skeleton's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base skeleton's CR other than from the mythic rank).

Hit Dice: A mythic skeleton's Hit Dice are determined as though it were a zombie instead of a skeleton.

Relentless (Ex) Any melee attack made against a mythic skeleton provokes an attack of opportunity from the skeleton.

Superior Two Weapon Fighting (Ex) A mythic humanoid skeleton usually fights with a scimitar in each hand. It does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.

Variant Mythic Skeletons

Other types of skeletons have the following additional or altered abilities.

Mythic Bloody Skeleton

Destroying a mythic bloody skeleton in the area of a non-mythic bless spell doesn't prevent it from returning to unlife.

Mythic Burning Skeleton

Add half the burning skeleton's mythic rank to its fiery aura damage and melee attack fire damage. Add its mythic rank to the DC of its fiery death ability.

Mythic Skeletal Champion

To create a mythic skeletal champion, increase its channel resistance by +2, and add the mythic subtype, additional Hit Dice as if the skeletal champion were a zombie of its size, and mythic abilities according to the base skeletal champion's Hit Dice.
