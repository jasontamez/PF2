A creature with this subtype is infused with mythic power and is capable of terrible and awe-inspiring feats. Some mythic creatures are powerful versions of existing monsters (such as minotaurs and medusas), others are completely new creatures that do not have a non-mythic equivalent (such as the devastator and plague swarms). For more information on mythic creatures, see the <a href="rulesf12f.html?Name=Mythic%20Rules&amp;Category=Optional%20Rule%20Systems">Mythic Rules</a>. Creatures with the mythic subtype have the following traits (these are already included in the mythic monster stat blocks presented in this book). <ul><li>Mythic rank, a number from 1 to 10, representing its overall mythic power. </li><li>Natural armor increase equal to its mythic rank. </li><li>Additional hit points per mythic rank, based on the type of Hit Dice it has (d6, d8, and so on). </li><li>DR 5/epic if the creature has at least 5 Hit Dice. If the creature already had DR, it adds epic to the qualities needed to bypass that reduction. </li><li>Spell resistance increase (if it has spell resistance) equal to its mythic rank. </li><li>Ability score increases, depending on its mythic rank. </li><li>Mythic feats, which generally are improved versions of standard feats. Mythic feats are indicated by a superscript "M." </li><li>Mythic Power (Su): The creature has the <a href="umra3a5.html?ItemName=Mythic%20Power">mythic power</a> universal monster ability. The effect of these abilities depend on its mythic rank.</li></ul>
