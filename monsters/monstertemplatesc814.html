Lycanthropes are humanoids with the ability to turn into animals and animal-humanoid hybrid shapes. Natural lycanthropes are born with this ability and have perfect control over their shapechanging. Afflicted lycanthropes contract this ability like a curse or disease from another lycanthrope; they sometimes change form involuntarily.

"Lycanthrope" is an inherited (for natural lycanthropes) or acquired (for afflicted lycanthropes) template that can be added to any humanoid.

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature or base animal (whichever is higher) + 1.

Size and Type: The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) gains the shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on the characteristics of some type of animal (referred to hereafter as the base animal) within one size category of the base creature's size. A lycanthrope's hybrid form is the same size as the base animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.

AC: In hybrid or animal form the lycanthrope has the natural armor bonus of the base animal increased by +2.

Defensive Abilities: A natural lycanthrope gains DR 10/silver in animal or hybrid form. An afflicted lycanthrope gains DR 5/silver in animal or hybrid form.

Speed: Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which form the lycanthrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature's speed.

Melee: A lycanthrope gains natural attacks in animal and hybrid forms according to the base animal.

Special Attacks: A lycanthrope retains all the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base creature. In hybrid or animal form it gains the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base animal. A lycanthrope also gains low-light vision, scent, and the following:

Change Shape (Su) All lycanthropes have three forms-a humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the new form between humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms and animal form. A natural lycanthrope can shift to any of its three alternate forms as a move-equivalent action. An afflicted lycanthrope can assume animal or hybrid form as a full-round action by making a DC 15 Constitution check, or humanoid form as a full-round action by making a DC 20 Constitution check. On nights when the full moon is visible, an afflicted lycanthrope gains a +5 morale bonus to Constitution checks made to assume animal or hybrid form, but a -5 penalty to Constitution checks made to assume humanoid form. An afflicted lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form automatically with the next sunrise, or after 8 hours of rest, whichever comes first. A slain lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead.

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) A natural lycanthrope's bite attack in animal or hybrid form infects a humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim's size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope, this ability has no effect.

Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) In any form, natural lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with animals related to their animal form. They can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check. Afflicted lycanthropes only gain this ability in animal or hybrid form.

Ability Scores: +2 Wis, -2 Cha in all forms; +2 Str, +2 Con in hybrid and animal forms. Lycanthropes have enhanced senses but are not fully in control of their emotions and animalistic urges. In addition to these adjustments to the base creature's stats, a lycanthrope's ability scores change when he assumes hybrid or animal form. In human form, the lycanthrope's ability scores are unchanged from the base creature's form. In animal and hybrid form, the lycanthrope's ability scores are the same as the base creature's or the base animal's, whichever ability score is higher.

Lycanthropy

A creature that catches lycanthropy becomes an afflicted lycanthrope, but shows no symptoms (and does not gain any of the template's adjustments or abilities) until the night of the next full moon, when the victim involuntarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity. The character remains in animal form until the next dawn and remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he makes a DC 20 Will save, in which case he becomes aware of his condition.

A <a href="spelldisplay96a6.html?ItemName=remove%20disease">remove disease</a> or <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher cures the affliction, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting lycanthrope's attack. Alternatively, consuming a dose of <a href="poisondisplay2d29.html?ItemName=wolfsbane">wolfsbane</a> (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560) gives an afflicted lycanthrope a new Fortitude save to recover from lycanthropy.


Bestial Werewolf

Bestial werewolves do not transform into normal wolves or wolf-human hybrids, but instead transform into oversized, monstrous wolves.

In addition to the changes for the lycanthrope template, make the following adjustments to the base creature.

Challenge Rating: Normal werewolf 's CR + 1.

Defensive Abilities: Regardless of whether it is natural or afflicted, a bestial werewolf gains DR 10/silver and ferocity when in animal form.

Special Attacks: A bestial werewolf does not gain the change shape special attack of the lycanthrope template, and instead gains the following special attacks.

Change Shape (Su): A bestial werewolf does not gain a hybrid form, and its animal form is that of a dire wolf, rather than an ordinary wolf. Otherwise, this ability functions identically to the change shape ability granted by the lycanthrope template.

Feral Counter (Ex): While in animal form, the first time each round that a creature damages a bestial werewolf, the bestial werewolf can take an attack of opportunity against the creature. The werewolf must threaten the triggering creature to use this ability.

Ability Scores: A bestial werewolf gains +4 Strength and +4 Constitution in animal form, instead of the normal statistic adjustments granted by the lycanthrope template.


Moonbound Werewolf

A moonbound werewolf 's lycanthropy is closely linked to the cycles of the moon.

In addition to the changes for the lycanthrope template, make the following adjustments to the base creature. Challenge Rating: Same as a normal werewolf (however, depending on the cycle of the moon, the CR of an encounter with a moonbound werewolf can shift up or down by 1).

Defensive Abilities: Regardless of whether it is a natural or afflicted lycanthrope, a moonbound werewolf gains DR 5/silver in animal or hybrid form. When the moon is near full, this increases to DR 10/silver; when the moon is full, it increases to DR 10/silver and magic; and when the moon is new, the moonbound werewolf loses this damage reduction.

Special Qualities: A moonbound werewolf gains the following special quality.

Moonbound (Su): A moonbound werewolf gains benefits and drawbacks based on the current phase of the moon. For the purposes of this ability, the moon is in one of four phases at any given time: full, nearly full, new, and other. The moon is full for the 3-day period when the moon appears the largest in the sky, it is nearly full for 4 days before it is full and 4 days afterward, and it is new for a 3-day period when the moon appears the darkest in the sky. The "other" phase encompasses the rest of each month. GMs who need to randomly determine the phase of the moon can use the table below. <table class="inner"><tr><td>d8</td><td>Moon Phase</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>New</td></tr> <tr><td>2-5</td><td>Other</td></tr> <tr><td>6-7</td><td>Nearly full</td></tr> <tr><td>8</td><td>Full</td></tr></table>
Ability Scores: When the moon is nearly full, the moonbound werewolf gains +2 Strength and +2 Constitution in human form, and the bonuses he gains in hybrid and animal forms increase to +4. When the moon is full, the moonbound werewolf gains +4 Strength and +4 Constitution in human form, and the bonuses he gains in hybrid and animal forms increase to +6. When the moon is new, the moonbound werewolf has -2 Strength and -2 Constitution in all forms, instead of the normal +2 bonuses.
