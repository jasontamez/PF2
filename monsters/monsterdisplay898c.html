Description

This predatory marine lizard swims with four flippered limbs and a powerful, fluke-like tail. Its extended snout is filled with sharp teeth, and it feeds on both aquatic and surface prey. They are known to attack ships, mistaking them for basking whales or other creatures. A tylosaurus grows up to 50 feet in length and weighs 30,000 pounds.
