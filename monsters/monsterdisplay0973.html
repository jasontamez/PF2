Description

Dire wolverines tend to be even more territorial than their smaller wolverine cousins, and they defend to the death the areas where they choose to live, often selecting humanoid-settled regions as their own and then fearlessly tearing the settlements apart. Dire wolverines grow to about 12 feet in length and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.
