Umasi - Monsters







Umasi

An emaciated humanoid bursts through the trees, brandishing a knife of black stone. His body is a patchwork of hair, skin, scales, and strange limbs stitched together with thick, black thread.

Special Abilities

Graft Flesh (Su) Umasi can graft the flesh and even limbs of other humanoids to their own bodies in a ritual that takes 1 hour to complete. To heal damage, an Umasi must have a supply of flesh (either living or dead), and the Umasi must make a DC 20 Heal check to treat deadly wounds. The Umasi can only heal damage with his graft flesh ability once per day, but there is no time limit on healing wounds and the Umasi does not need a healer's kit (and does not take a penalty for lacking one). This ability otherwise functions as the treat deadly wounds use of the Heal skill.

Umasi can also graft additional limbs onto their bodies; each extra arm gives the Umasi an additional unarmed strike, while each additional leg adds +5 feet to the Umasi's speed. An Umasi can have a maximum of six arms and six legs.

Harvest Organs (Su) An Umasi can remove a vital organ when he delivers a coup de grace against a humanoid opponent with a slashing or piercing weapon. The next round, the Umasi can consume the harvested organ as a move action to gain the benefits of the death knell spell (caster level equal to the Umasi's Hit Dice).

Immortal Flesh (Su) Umasi are immune to disease and aging effects, and they gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.

Immune to Healing (Ex) Umasi do not heal damage naturally, and are not healed by positive or negative energy.

Description

Reclusive and shrouded in mystery, the Umasi-or Harvestmen, as they are known across the Mwangi Expanse-are a race of humanoids who exist between life and death. Unable to heal or procreate naturally, the Umasi extend their lives by transplanting the skin, organs, or even entire appendages of other humanoids onto parts of their own bodies. As a result, there is no typical description for a Harvestman-each is a patchwork conglomeration of different features, though most Umasi have multiple limbs of varying sizes. The need to use body parts of generally the same size and shape makes most Umasi human-sized; few are over 6 feet tall. Most weigh between 150 and 300 pounds, and the constant addition of new flesh has left little distinction between genders.
