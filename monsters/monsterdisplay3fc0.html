Urtleytlar, The Tempest Queen - Monsters







Urtleytlar, The Tempest Queen

This writhing terror is made of tentacles and the heads of multiple hounds. The figure of a beautiful woman extends from the monster's center, though its fiendish visage is far from welcoming.

Description

An awakened horror shaken from the depths of the sea by the catastrophic calling of Earthfall, the beast known as Urtleytlar swims the Arcadian Ocean, wreaking havoc wherever she treads. Urtleytlar is one of the Lesser Spawn of Rovagug, having escaped the Rough Beast's prison deep beneath the earth like those before her. The drow of Sekamina tell legends of a terrible many-headed beast crawling from the depths of the Dying Sea to prey upon their coastal settlements, and scholars among the dark elves hypothesize that this beast may have originated from somewhere in Orv. In this instance, their legends hold true, for Urtleytlar indeed swam the lightless depths of the Sightless Sea for centuries until she made it up the Braid, raided the aboleth population guarding the Inverted Sea, and emerged into a broken Azlant already claimed by the Arcadian Ocean.

Urtleytlar spent her first millennia on Golarion's surface terrorizing the eastern coasts of Arcadia, after which the foul beast felt an irresistible call to the lands of the east. The world rippled with destruction after the passing of Aroden, and this surge of chaos washed over Urtleytlar as she felt the pull of her lord Rovagug in the Inner Sea region. She swam eastward, weaving through the shattered continent of Azlant, and as she headed toward the Eye of Abendego, she saw the storm as a manifestation of the Rough Beast's destructive power. The monstrous scylla delights in the powerful storm, and preaches Rovagug's words of destruction through the ruin she sows.

Since making the Abendego Gulf her home, Urtleytlar has gathered numerous evil aquatic humanoids (and even depraved sailors) to her wretched bosom. The boggards and skum that make up the greatest number of her minions extend her reach to the broken shores of the Sodden Lands and Shackles. Some say she guides foolish sailors hoping to sail into the hurricane, providing them temporary safety in exchange for a taste of their souls.

A handful of boggard tribes swear fealty to the Tempest Queen by capturing slaves and dragging them to the shores as sacrifices. Urtleytlar makes choice selections from among her minions' offerings, leaving the scraps for the boggards themselves to enjoy. Though she doesn't need the froglike humanoids for her conquests, she nonetheless enjoys their adoration. In addition to these minions, she counts a number of skum armies-left masterless after their abandonment by their aboleth rulers-as her thralls. Beneath the howling winds of the Eye of Abendego, hundreds of skum dwell in the ruins of Lirgen, now sunken beneath the sea. From this base, they make deals with both boggards and humans who have managed to survive in the flooded wastes of the Sodden Lands. These tribes and gangs provide Urtleytlar with slaves and food, and she strengthens their reach by aiding them in their destructive endeavors. In addition to these humanoids, Urtleytlar uses Megrexti, her charybdis counterpart and favorite plaything, as a living weapon, sending it into the middle of fleets of ships or other attackers and laughing in delight as it tears her victims to pieces.

Urtleytlar chose as her alternate form a strangely beautiful Cyclops woman. As old a creature as she is, perhaps Urtleytlar feels a kinship with the giants who once ruled the land and waters she now calls home. Regardless, her alternate form has tricked many explorers searching for the ruins of Ghol-Gan, easing them into an odd complacency before she utterly destroys them and their crews.

Infamous Deeds

Thriving within the dangerous force of the Eye of Abendego, the Tempest Queen gleefully besets any ship or fleet hoping to penetrate the storm. Many explorers in search of lost cities from Lirgen or ruins of ancient Ghol-Gan risk running across this wrathful creature.

An insane, destructive whimsy marks Urtleytlar's behavior, and she delights in betrayal at the slightest offense. She leads some sailors safely through the storm for a time, then closes off the pockets of calm on the pitiful crew, leaving them to be ripped apart by the blistering winds and churning waters.

According to the ship logs of the famed explorer Escobar Vellian, his last major encounter in the Sodden Lands was escaping the clutches of Urtleytlar. Assaulted by her fanatical skum minions and subjected to her numerous magical gambits, Vellian lost two ships during his attempts to escape, and returned to his home port with only one ship and less than one-fifth of his original crew.

Adventure Hooks

Urtleytlar tends to find sailors before they find her, and those who purposefully seek out the legendary monster are regarded as mad.<ul><li>Eager to acquire more power to further her course of destruction, Urtleytlar sends skum scouts to raid the underwater city of Wetan near the Sodden Lands. Once a port city of Lirgen, Wetan fell beneath the waves with the formation of the Eye of Abendego, and after the settlement's destruction, a tribe of locathah squatters sought the protection of its abandoned buildings. There they discovered an inoperable planetary gate and managed to partially activate it. Urtleytlar can sense the power and wants it for her own, despite not knowing exactly what she might gain.</li><li>Though Urtleytlar enjoys the caress of the Eye, she is hardly contained to one place, and her touch can be felt on the shores of the Shackles, the Sodden Lands, and Mediogalti Isle. Her destructive roaming causes especial trouble for the pirates of the Shackles, and a number of unlikely collaborators have settled their grudges, forming a pact to locate the dangerous scylla and kill her. Of course, with an endeavor like this, the pirates are eager for additional help.</li></ul>
