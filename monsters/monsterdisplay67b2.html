Tychilarius - Monsters







Tychilarius

A host of tentacles-some tipped with eyes and others ending in mouths-flail around a massive spiraling maw ringed with thousands of teeth.

Special Abilities

Overcharge Synapses (Su) As a standard action, Tychilarius can overstimulate the nervous system of any creature that has taken Intelligence damage from Tychilarius's shatter mind ability. The target takes 15d6 points of electricity damage as every nerve in its body misfires. This damage can be reduced to half with a successful DC 32 Fortitude saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Plasma Bolt (Su) As a standard action, Tychilarius can fire a bolt of plasma from one of its tentacles at a target within 300 feet (no range increment) as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit, a plasma bolt deals 15d6 points of damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.

Reform Flesh (Su) Tychilarius can use the flesh and energy from a creature killed by its void maw ability to give birth to other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. It can create a number of such creatures whose total Hit Dice equal that of the creature killed by void maw. For example, if Tychilarius killed a 20th-level human wizard in its void maw, it could give birth to two nehthalggus (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 197). This process takes 24 hours.

Shatter Mind (Su) Tychilarius exudes quivering psychic energy. Any creature adjacent to Tychilarius must succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.

Starflight (Su) In outer space, Tychilarius can survive in the void and fly at an incredible speed. Its travel times vary, but a trip within a single solar system should take it 3d20 hours, and a trip farther than that should take it 3d20 days or more if Tychilarius knows the way to its destination.

Void Maw (Su) When Tychilarius bites and successfully grabs a creature, it can attempt a combat maneuver check as a free action to draw the creature into its massive, chaotic form (as though attempting to pin the target). A creature drawn into Tychilarius's void maw must succeed at a DC 39 Will saving throw each round or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.

Though this ability is similar to swallow whole, a creature in the maw can't cut its way out. Any creature in the area of a magic circle against evil or magic circle against chaos spell is unaffected by the confusion effect. A swallowed creature can escape by using plane shift or similar magic. Every day a creature remains in this void, it gains 1 negative level. A creature that dies from this effect is incorporated into Tychilarius's form; it can be reshaped into another creature via reform flesh, and is difficult to resurrect. Anyone attempting to resurrect a creature killed in the maw must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check to return the creature to life. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Golarion first heard the name Tychilarius thousands of years ago, when various Garundi tribes gathered in the nascent nation of Osirion and began to build the great empire that would one day arise there. Little information regarding Tychilarius from this bygone era survives to the current day, and what has resurfaced is contradictory and vague. What is known is that Tychilarius is a powerful leader in the Dominion of the Black, a starfaring association of creatures from the Dark Tapestry.

While Tychilarius's relationship with the early Osirians seems to have been primarily antagonistic, there is evidence that a few cults formed around the being. Many scholarly texts claim that these early cultists gave Tychilarius the appellation "The Drowned God." That title, however, is a misnomer, for while Tychilarius is aquatic and extremely powerful, it can't grant spells and is not a god. In truth, the appellation is a mistranslation made by a scholar-cultist who was less than savvy about the intricacies of the Dominion of the Black's use of language. Older texts suggest that the closest accurate approximation of this being's title is "They Drown the Gods in Oblivion." Modernday scholars, theologians, and would-be worshipers simply use the name "Tychilarius." The name by which the early Osirian cultists addressed the creature has been lost to history, and most extant records suggest that they referred to the focus of their worship primarily by epithets.

Many academics suspect that Tychilarius originally hailed from the planet Aucturn, considering the being's connection to Osirion and the countdown clocks within that country mysteriously linked to Aucturn's movement. However, recently uncovered texts retrieved from a Night Herald cult suggest that this creature's origin lies across the vastness of space in some far-flung galaxy as yet unmapped by Golarion's astronomers.

Tychilarius seems to be a singular creature that is made up of thousands of other individual creatures fused into one horrific organism with a united intelligence. It is said that Tychilarius was birthed from a black hole into which millions of foul creatures had been pulled. They were ripped apart into mere particles and reassembled into the terror incarnate that was somehow ejected from the oblivion within the black hole.

Tychilarius is believed to be immortal, and has traveled throughout the cosmos. Well after its creation, it likely spent time on Aucturn before coming to Golarion. Currently-mercifully-it is locked away in some manner of prison. The nature of this confinement is uncertain, but what matters is that for the moment, Tychilarius cannot reach Golarion. Scholars posit that the creature was banished while it dwelled in Osirion, perhaps by ancient Osirian wizards or clerics, and that the door and key to this prison still rest somewhere in that ancient nation.

Cultists such as the Night Heralds have performed hundreds of rituals over the years to call Tychilarius back to this world, but to date none have succeeded. Despite these failures, the Night Heralds remain unfazed and continue their dark work. In recent years, a cell of Night Herald cultists uncovered a supposed relic that would draw Tychilarius from its prison into the body and mind of another being. Though the ritual failed and most of the cultists were slain, rumors insist the attempt was almost a success. Admittedly, these tales mostly circulate among other cultists eager to succeed where their predecessors failed. True or not, these claims have spurred an increase in such activity by the Night Heralds. While none have yet managed to free Tychilarius, their attempts have summoned a host of lesser, but still dangerous, malevolent creatures.

Many scholars study beings such as Tychilarius out of simple curiosity or-especially among theologians of goodly churches-with an eye toward protecting the world from the ravages of these creatures. Yet the most knowledge of Tychilarius rests in the hands of those who study the Dominion of the Black and among the members of the Night Heralds, who hope to attract the attention of the creatures in the Dark Tapestry and bring about the end of Golarion. In addition to delving into this forbidden knowledge themselves, such cultists do what they can to eliminate it from the libraries of those who might use it to keep Tychilarius sealed away, stealing and destroying documents and even murdering scholars. If they ever successfully open the door to Tychilarius's prison, Golarion will certainly fall under the glaring eye of the Dominion, and it would be only a matter of time before the Dominion of the Black's organic starships begin dropping to the planet's surface.
