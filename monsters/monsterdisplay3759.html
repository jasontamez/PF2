Snowdrifter - Monsters







Snowdrifter

What appeared in gloom to be a lost traveler is revealed by torchlight to be made of packed snow. This is no mannequin, though, for it reaches out with its frosty hand.

Special Abilities

Amorphous (Ex) A snowdrifter has immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, polymorph, and stunning effects. It is not subject to critical hits and, having no clear front or back, cannot be flanked.

Snowbody (Ex) A snowdrifter can arrange itself into the shape of any Medium creature or object as a standard action, but its coloration is always in shades of gray. The snowdrifter's abilities remain the same regardless of form. It does, however, gain a +10 bonus on Disguise checks when it has concealment.

Concealment negated by darkvision still counts for this ability (as darkvision is only in black and white). In a snowy environment, the snowdrifter can use the Hide skill without cover or concealment.

Snow Flurry (Sp) As long as the ambient temperature is cold (40 or below), a snowdrifter gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus, and it can dissolve into a flurry of snow as a move action. Treat this as gaseous form. Returning to solid form is a standard action. If the temperature rises above 40, the snowdrifter must reform on its next action.

Soulchill (Su) A snowdrifter's touch siphons both heat and vigor. Its touch deals both cold and nonlethal damage in an amount equal to 1d4 plus its Charisma modifier.

Description

A snowdrifter is a creature of cold and darkness. Its body is a heap of snow held together by the snowdrifter's malevolent will. Although not truly incorporeal, its fluid form is nearly invulnerable to physical attacks. Snowdrifters are skillful mimics, but when one speaks, its voice always sounds distant, as if carried on the wind.

The snowdrifter's touch drains not only warmth, but also vigor. This stolen life sustains the snowdrifter's own unnatural existence. Snowdrifters prefer the life force of sentient creatures and are known to ambush unwary travelers. At other times, a snowdrifter takes the form of a person or animal to lure out its prey into the cold and dark. They find taking the form of a recent victim to be especially effective.

Folk tales say snowdrifters spontaneously generate after a person freezes to death. They are solitary by nature, but powerful creatures of cold and darkness sometimes employ snowdrifters as assassins.

Environment: Snowdrifters dwell on the border between civilization and the frozen wastes. They prey primarily on travelers, but during the snowbound months they are a danger even to city dwellers. Snowdrifters avoid temperatures above freezing, which cause them to slowly melt.

Typical Physical Characteristics: In its natural state, a snowdrifter resembles a heap of snow roughly 5 feet in diameter and rising to only a foot or two at its peak, although it can take any shape of roughly the same volume. It weighs 10 lb.
