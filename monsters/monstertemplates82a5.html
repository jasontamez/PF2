Creatures with the shadow creature template dwell on the Shadow Plane, only rarely venturing onto other, brighter planes, and can be summoned by shadow callers. A shadow creature's CR increases by +1. A shadow creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: Senses gains darkvision 60 ft. and low-light vision; Defensive Abilities gains energy resistance and DR as noted on the table below; SR gains SR equal to new CR + 6; Special Abilities Shadow Blend (Su) In any condition of illumination other than bright light, a shadow creature blends into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). A shadow creature can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.
