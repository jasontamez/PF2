Acquired/Inherited Template Inherited
Simple Template No
Usable with Summons Yes - Spellcasters with ties to the fey (such as sorcerers with the fey bloodline) can summon fey-touched creatures with summon monster spells

Fey-touched creatures are descended from inhabitants of the First World and often possess striking features compared to their normal counterparts, such as bright coloration or a cunning visage. The fey-touched creature's First World ancestor needn't be a fey specifically, and even magical beasts, First World gnomes, and other non-fey inhabitants of the fecund, magical plane can produce fey-touched heirs generations after their initial dalliance with residents of other planes. Some fey-touched creatures thus claim to be descended from the legendary Tane and even the godlike Eldest, though these claims are likely unfounded'such claims themselves intentional or accidental manifestations of the creature's hereditary First World influence.

A fey-touched creature's CR increases by 1 only if the base creature has 5 or more Hit Dice. The fey-touched creature template can be applied only to living creatures. A fey-touched creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same. Spellcasters with ties to the fey (such as sorcerers with the fey bloodline) can summon fey-touched creatures with summon monster spells and take fey-touched creatures as improved familiars at 3rd level, similar to selecting celestial or infernal familiars.

Rebuild Rules: Senses gains low-light vision; Defensive Abilities gains +2 bonus on Will saves and DR as noted on the table; SR gains SR equal to new CR +5; Special Qualities change shape (a single fixed Small or Medium humanoid form, <a href="spelldisplay3b5b.html?ItemName=alter%20self">alter self</a>), woodland stride (as the druid ability).
