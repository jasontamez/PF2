While most giants have the physical features of the type of giant of their immediate ancestors, occasionally a giant gives birth to a child who has physical traits associated with one of the other types of giants. Hill giants are the one type of giant whose traits don't arise in other giants.

"Mongrel giant" is an inherited template that can be added to any creature with the giant subtype (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A mongrel giant retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as the base creature's CR + 1.

Special Qualities: A mongrel giant retains all the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base creature and gains the following special quality.

Giant Ancestry (Ex): A mongrel giant has traits and features of another variety of giant and gains additional abilities based on this ancestry (see Giant Ancestry Traits below).

Abilities: Con +2. Most mongrel giants gain an additional ability score increase as determined by their giant ancestry; if an ancestry grants a bonus to Constitution higher than +2, that higher bonus replaces this standard +2 bonus.
