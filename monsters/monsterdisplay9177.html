Eel, Sand - Monsters







Eel, Sand

A long and sinuous form slithers across the sand. Glistening, iridescent skin stretches over its 8-foot-long frame. As it glides along, it opens its narrow mouth to reveal needle-like nubs of bone protruding from the soft flesh of its mouth.

Special Abilities

Erupt (Ex) A sand eel that has buried itself in the sand can quickly erupt from the ground and attack. This counts as a charge, except the sand eel can only move its speed (not twice its speed), and it gains a +2 on its attack roll (in addition to the normal bonuses and penalties for charging).

Sandwalking (Ex) Sand eels travel across sand, quicksand, gravel, and other areas with loose, small debris as if traversing normal ground rather than difficult terrain.

Description

Sand eels are unusual creatures native to Katapesh. They gain their name from the way they slither across the sand; unlike snakes, which must wriggle in wide S-shapes, sand eels slide along with the help of dozens of tiny feelers that sink into the sand and propel them forward, giving them a weirdly smooth movement.

Sand eels measure 6 to 12 feet long and can weigh several hundred pounds. Their tiny bones and thin skins make them very light for their size.
