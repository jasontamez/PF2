Special Abilities

Dazzling Emergence (Ex) During a surprise round, a desert drake can use Dazzling Display as a standard action.

Sandstorm Breath (Su) As a standard action, a desert drake can spit a ball of electrically charged sand that bursts into a cloud. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of slashing damage plus 4d8 points of electricity damage in a 15-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 19 for half). The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds, dealing no damage but otherwise acting as obscuring mist. Once a desert drake uses its breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Savage Bite (Ex) A desert drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20.

Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a desert drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.

Description

Among the fiercest of their kind, desert drakes exhibit a lust for destruction as merciless as any desert storm. These fierce, ambush predators hunt by finding high perches among rocky outcroppings and surveying their surroundings. When likely prey wanders into sight, a desert drake dives into the sand and burrows toward its quarry or flies low with cover from dunes or other outcroppings. Drawing near the likely path of its victims, it bursts from the sand or dives from above to catch foes off guard, preferring to attack targets that exhibit the most fear first. Before enemies can recover from the initial onslaught, a desert drake exhales a cloud of electrified dust, using its superior senses to press the attack. Mated pairs of desert drakes hunt larger prey and groups of victims, and rampages of the beasts might gather near overland trade routes to devour whole caravans.

A typical desert drake measures 15 feet long from nose to tail tip, has a supple, wormlike build, and weighs about 2,500 pounds.
