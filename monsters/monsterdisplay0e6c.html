Special Abilities

Adaptive Camouflage (Ex) A stormghost's
hide shifts coloration over time to match
its environment, granting it +4 racial
bonus on Stealth checks within the
ranger favored terrain type matching its
current terrain. A stormghost moving
to a different terrain must stay 1d4
weeks to gain the bonus.
Impaling Leap (Ex) As a standard
action, a stormghost can leap onto a target at least one
size category smaller than itself and impale the victim.
The target suffers 6d8+16 points of piercing damage and
is pinned (DC 26 Reflex negates). The stormghost must
maintain the pin as normal. Pinned foes take impaling leap
damage each round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.
Static Aura (Su) A stormghost can surround itself with crackling
electricity that leaps from its body. All creatures within 5 feet
of the stormghost take 2d6 points of electricity damage at
the beginning of the stormghost's turn. A stormghost can
suppress or resume this ability as a free action.
Static Blast (Su) As a standard action, a stormghost can focus its
static charge into a bolt, releasing it in a 40-foot line that deals
15d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 25 Reflex
save halves this damage. A stormghost can use its static blast
once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Cunning hunters, stormghosts prowl lonely arctic tors,
so named by their victims for their ability to conjure
malignant weather and attack unseen. Stormghosts
search constantly for food, tracking animals and intelligent
creatures alike, and their appearances vary depending on the
season, allowing them to blend into any environment. While
stormghosts are thankfully rare, their regeneration mitigates
the effects of aging, allowing them to live for more
than 2,000 years. A typical stormghost stands 8
feet tall in its regular posture, but can extend
its legs to reach up to 14 feet, with its muscled
flesh and hardened chitin armor making it
weigh roughly 1,500 pounds.
