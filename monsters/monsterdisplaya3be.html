This hag's hair, claws, and teeth crackle with sparks of electricity.

Special Abilities

Child-Scent (Ex) A storm hag has the scent ability, but only
with respect to humanoid children and immature animals.
Thus, she could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of
wolf pups, but not the child's parents or the den mother.

Storm Rider (Su) A storm hag is considered two size
categories larger for the purpose of wind effects.

Storm Strike (Su) Each time a storm hag makes a
successful attack with her bite, claws, or a weapon that is
predominantly made of metal, the attack deals an additional
1d6 points of electricity damage.

Whipping Winds (Su) As a standard action, a storm hag
can use gust of wind to trip her foes. This ability can only
affect one target within 30 feet, and the storm hag uses
her normal CMB. The gust of wind doesn't create its normal
effects. The trip attempt does not provoke an attack of
opportunity, but casting the spell-like ability does as normal.

Description

When the clouds turn gray and the winds pick up into a
howl, wise travelers pray that the cause is only a natural
tempest and not a storm hag. A storm hag resembles an
old woman with a thundercloud of hair. Her mouth hangs
open, revealing thin pointed teeth with small arcs of
electricity jumping across them. Black talons sprout from
her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm
hag weighs 70 pounds and stands around 4 feet tall, though
if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet.

Storm Hag Covens

A storm hag is haughty and views her way of doing things as
the only proper approach, forcing coven members to ride a
fine line between flattery and submission. Coven members
gain the child-scent ability as long as they are within 100
feet of the storm hag. In addition, a coven with a storm hag
as a member has access to the following additional spell-like
abilities: call lightning storm (DC 18), plague storm (DC
19), quench (DC 16), whirlwind (DC 21), and wind wall.

Customizing Hag Covens

Any group of three hags can form a coven, but realistically, many types of hags will never cross paths or deign to work with one another. Blood hags are loath to form covens that are not under their control. Annis hags are likewise domineering, rarely working with more powerful hags. Storm hags usually prefer allying with other storm hags, but they will occasionally form covens with green hags or sea hags. Sea hags sometimes seek out a green hag to lead them. Mute hags-among the most powerful of mortal hags-relish the destruction of relationships, and their involvement in a coven is typically transient, lasting only as long as whatever barrier prompted them to seek sisters in the first place. Night hags and dreamthief hags are outsiders that wander the planes in search of victims. These cautious schemers do not hesitate to involve mortal hags in their machinations, readily joining covens when it proves expedient. Their immortality grants them great patience and enough time to plan contingencies so that betraying them becomes a risky proposition.

A typical hag coven can cast the spells listed in the green hag's monster entry (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 167). Blood hags, storm hags, and winter hags always grant the spells and abilities listed in their bestiary entries. To reflect the diversity of powers hags can invoke, Game Masters can customize the spell lists of covens based on their membership; each type of hag makes specific spells available to cast as coven magic.

All covens can cast the following spells, regardless of the hags that comprise them: <a href="spelldisplayc394.html?ItemName=Animate%20Dead">animate dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayedf1.html?ItemName=Baleful%20Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4414.html?ItemName=Bestow%20Curse">bestow curse</a>, <a href="spelldisplay3517.html?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya33d.html?ItemName=Commune">commune</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf711.html?ItemName=Dream">dream</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya816.html?ItemName=Forcecage">forcecage</a>, <a href="spelldisplay218d.html?ItemName=Mind%20Blank">mind blank</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7555.html?ItemName=Reincarnate">reincarnate</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya200.html?ItemName=Speak%20with%20Dead">speak with dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplay1ac4.html?ItemName=Veil">veil</a>, <a href="spelldisplay42e8.html?ItemName=Vision">vision</a>

If dryads, nymphs, and sprites represent the grace and beauty of unspoiled nature, then surely the annis hag, green hag, and sea hag embody its savage, destructive side. Though not fey themselves, hags appear to be somehow tied to nature, even if no more than as a distorted reflection of it. Hags are foul, wicked creatures, warped with cruelty and evil. Uniformly female and invariably repulsive, these misshapen crones plot dark deeds over bubbling cauldrons, either singly or in sinister triads known as covens.
