Description

Fire giant kings rule over their volcanic dominions with a cruel and heavy hand. Most kings seek the hand of a queen to reign beside them, both to secure their own power and to provide heirs to accede to their thrones when they inevitably fall in battle. A fire giant king must always watch his back, however, for there are always claimants eager to seize his position.

This lumbering giant has short stumpy legs and powerful, muscular arms. Its hair and beard seem to be made of fire.
