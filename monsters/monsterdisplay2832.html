Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Con and 1 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves. If a creature fails two consecutive saving throws, its jaw locks, its tongue swells, and its lips pull back, making speech impossible. This condition ends when the Charisma damage is healed.

Description

Most common in warm or temperate waters, the death's head jellyfish is an aggressive predator. The creature derives its name from the pattern on its 4-foot-wide bell and from the poison it delivers with its tentacles. Those unfortunate enough to be subjected to this toxin develop rigor of the facial muscles that results in a wide-eyed grimace if left untreated.
