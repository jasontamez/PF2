Robot Golem - Monsters







Golem, Robot Golem

Though corroded and damaged, this bipedal metallic construct moves silently, as though powered by some force other than its own rattling gears.

Special Abilities

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A robot golem is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. <ul><li>A magical attack that deals electricity damage deals half damage to the golem. Additionally, for 1d4+1 rounds the golem gains the benefits of haste and goes berserk. The uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing an object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach; it then moves on to spread more destruction. The golem comes back under the control of its creator when the duration ends.</li><li>A transmute metal to wood spell reduces the robot golem's damage reduction by 5 and its natural armor bonus by 9 for 1d4 rounds.</li><li>A robot golem is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.</li></ul> Rend Construct (Ex) This functions as the rend special ability, except the robot golem can rend only other constructs.

Shockwave (Ex) A robot golem can release a pulse of electrical energy held within its nonfunctioning batteries as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This pulse is a 30-foot-radius spread that deals 8d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in its area of effect (Reflex DC 19 half). The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Description

When robots are damaged beyond the abilities of Numerian technologists to repair, salvages sometimes animate their frames via magic rather than science. What results is more of a walking mechanical corpse that lacks the intelligence and vulnerabilities of a true robot. The arcanists of the Technic League often employ these magically animated constructs to combat rogue robots or those under the control of their enemies.

Construction

A robot golem's body used to be a Large robot, but is now nonfunctional. Any major damage on the intended body must be repaired prior to animation.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They stand apart from other constructs in the nature of their animating force-golems are granted their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the will of the golem's creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of another, but the golem's creator can always resume control by commanding the golem to obey him alone.


Constructing a Golem

The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components used in its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the materials required and the total cost for its creation.

Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. Building a golem with the advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.


Shield Guardians

A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the golem's construction-a completed golem cannot later be "upgraded" to function as a shield guardian.

Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so). If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.

Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base golem, but with the following additional special qualities. A shield guardian's CR is equal to the base golem's CR + 2.

Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of its amulet is within 30 feet.

Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.

Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can locate the amulet's wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.

Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.

Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).

Construction: A shield guardian's base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem's cost. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem's kind. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time-it costs 20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian's total cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. The creator must have a minimum caster level of 2 higher than the base golem's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells are added to the base golem's requirements: discern location and either shield or shield other.
