Crepitus - Monsters







Crepitus

A small, gaunt humanoid creature possessing an oversized saurian  head and a thick, powerful tail hovers in the  air, its tiny wings a blur. The creature's smooth reddish skin is covered in a maze of glowing golden runes. Its fingers and toes end in razor-sharp claws, and a wide mouth beneath incongruously intelligent eyes bristles with rows of tiny needle teeth.

Special Abilities

Poison (Ex) injury Fortitude DC 13; initial 1d4 Int, secondary 2d4 Int.

Rune Fire (Su) At will, a crepitus can cause the runes covering its body to radiate intense heat. Creatures within 5 feet of the crepitus take 1d6 points of fire damage (DC 13 Reflex save for half). Creatures struck by the crepitus's claws or that hit the crepitus with melee weapons take automatic fire damage, with no save allowed. Creatures that attack and are not adjacent are immune to this effect.

Spell Turning (Su) Spells that specifically target a crepitus devil that fail to get past its spell resistance are turned back on the caster. This effect is identical to a spell turning spell, except that a crepitus can only affect a number of spell levels each round equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as if the crepitus were a 9th-level caster.

Description

It is speculated that Asmodeus spawned the first crepitus devils, sometimes called magewretches, to tempt and corrupt mortal wizards into damning their souls. Yet while it is true that the crepitus is  a highly intelligent creature with a gift for spellcraft and all things arcane, its great intellect is countered by its foolishness and inability to competently lure mortals to Asmodeus's will. As a result, specimens seen on the Material Plane are more often slaves than fiendish tempters.
