Special Abilities

Battlefield Healing (Su) Once per day as a swift action, this troop can heal itself or an adjacent creature of 10d6 points of damage.

Volley (Ex) A Glorious Reclamation sergeant troop can fire a volley of arrows as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 100 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's space. All creatures in any of these lines take 5d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 21 half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Description

This represents an average troop of Glorious Reclamation sergeants active around Westcrown and Citadel Rivad. Although most of the individual soldiers in the troop are skilled fighters, the troop contains a sufficient number of clerics to provide the troop with limited healing. These troops are normally outfitted with longswords, full plate armor, and tower shields.

Variant Glorious Reclamation Troops

Some troops are equipped with additional armaments or superior training that gives them special attacks in addition to the abilities listed above.

Devilslayer Troop (CR 14): This troop consists of paladins with specialized weapons and skills. Its troop damage counts as cold iron and silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. A devilslayer troop moves at a speed of 20 feet, is immune to disease and fear, and gains a +3 resistance bonus on saving throws. This troop also gains the following special attack.

Smite Evil (Su): This troop gains a +20 bonus on troop damage rolls against evil creatures. Additionally, the troop gains a +3 deflection bonus to its AC.

Field Hospital Troop (CR 14): This troop includes several clerics and warpriests trained in combat medicine and able to channel positive energy and magically enhance the troop's weapons. A field hospital troop moves at a speed of 20 feet, and its AC is reduced by 3. It can use battlefield healing five times per day. Its members are primarily outfitted with breastplates and longswords. Additionally, a field hospital troop gains the following special attacks.

Channel Energy (Su): As a standard action, the troop can emit a 30-foot radius burst of positive energy to damage undead creatures, dealing 5d6 points of damage (Will DC 25 half ). This burst can originate from the corner of any square in the troop's space. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 bonus from the Glory domain.

Holy Weapons (Su): Twice per day as a swift action, the troop gains a +20 bonus on troop and volley damage rolls against evil creatures, and such attacks are considered good and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. This effect lasts for 6 rounds.

Knights Inheritor Troop (CR 15): This unit includes a handful of mounted knights inheritor among its number, each equipped with a lance. A knights inheritor troop has a speed of 40 feet and reach of 10 feet. The troop deals 3 x its troop damage if it moves at least 10 feet before making a troop attack.

Rassophore Troop (CR 15): This troop includes several rassophores, arcane spellcasters dedicated to the Glorious Reclamation, who provide magical support to their fellow soldiers. The rassophores cast flame arrow on the ammunition of the other members of the troop, which adds 1d6 points of fire damage to the troop's volley attack. The rassophores also augment their allies' defenses, granting a +2 enhancement bonus to the troop's AC and fire resistance 10.

The troop gains the spell-like abilities (CL 15th) listed below, which it can use as a standard action. It does not need to succeed at concentration checks to use such abilities in battle and the spells' range can be determined from the corner of any square in the troop's space.

At-will-black tentacles, fireball (DC 16), greater dispel magic, magic missile, shout (DC 17), wall of force

3/day-chain lightning (CR 19), dismissal (DC 18), permanent image (DC 19), summon monster VI

Siege Engineer Troop (CR 14): Trained in the transport and use of siege engines, this troop swiftly brings ballistae and catapults to bear against enemies. A siege engineer troop has a speed of 10 feet and lacks the volley special attack, but it gains the following special attacks.

Ballista Volley (Ex): As a move action, the troop can fire a volley of ballista bolts. This attack takes the form of a 360-foot line and deals 8d8 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 21 half ) to creatures in the line. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Catapult Bombardment (Ex): As a move action, the troop can target a single square up to 400 feet away with catapult stones (minimum range of 100 feet). This attack deals 12d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in a 30-footradius burst (Reflex DC 21 for half ). If the siege engineer troop does not have line of sight to the target square, creatures in the burst gain a +4 circumstance bonus on their Reflex saving throws. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

The troop subtype represents an organized group of trained soldiers who act as a unit, rather than as individuals. A troop is something of an abstraction, in that the component creatures that make up the troop are mostly irrelevant; only the troop as a whole matters for the purposes of combat. A troop is similar to a swarm, but is normally composed of Small or Medium creatures. Large groups of Tiny or smaller creatures should use the normal swarm rules.

Troop Subtype: A troop is a collection of creatures that acts as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but typically as part of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A troop attempts saving throws as a single creature.

A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shapable (as a similar spell effect), though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures.

The exact number of a troop's component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures.

Troop Traits: A troop is not subject to flanking, but it is subject to critical hits and sneak attacks if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 hit points or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop, though the damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, a troop cannot be subjected to the bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, drag, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuvers, except by area effects that include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent.

A troop is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate and multiple target spells such as haste), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as fireball or mass hold monster). A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage, it disperses and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.

Troop Attack: Creatures with the troop subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. A troop's stat block has "troop" in its Melee entry with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below, plus its Strength modifier.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Troop HD</td><td>Troop Base Damage</td></tr> <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6</td></tr> <tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6</td></tr> <tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6</td></tr> <tr><td>16-20</td><td>4d6</td></tr> <tr><td>21 or more</td><td>5d6</td></tr></table>
Unless stated otherwise, a troop's attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a troop attack's damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the troop's attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage, or inflict more damage than their Hit Dice would normally suggest. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and resolve attacks of opportunity by inflicting automatic troop damage on any foe in reach who provokes such an attack of opportunity. Troops are still limited to making one such attack per round unless they have a feat or special ability that states otherwise.

Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a successful caster level check (DC = 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.

Looting Troops: Although troops are composed of a number of individual creatures, the chaos and destruction of battle means that not all of these creatures' equipment survives the rigors of combat. As a result, parties who wish to claim usable gear or treasure from slain foes treat a troop as a single creature for the purposes of looting, and should be able to recover gear worth a total value equal to the troop's expected treasure value (as determined by the troop's CR).
