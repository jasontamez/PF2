Special Abilities

Cold (Ex) A crone queen's body generates intense cold, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage with its touch or when creatures attack it with unarmed strikes and natural attacks.

Hexes (Su) A crone queen can use the hexes listed in its special attacks entry as a 20th-level witch . The save DC to resist a crone queen's hex is 24.

Ice Staff (Su) As a free action, a crone queen can create a magic staff out of supernaturally hard ice that functions as a +5 frost quarterstaff. The crone queen can use her energy drain attack with this staff. The ice staff melts away instantly if it leaves the crone queen's hands.

Unearthly Cold (Su) Half the cold damage caused by cold spells and spell-like abilities cast by the crone queen is not subject to cold resistance or immunity.

Description

Crone queens are unique and deadly creatures formed from the frozen remains of Baba Yaga's daughters.
