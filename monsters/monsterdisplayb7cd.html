Tactics

Before Combat The priest casts shield of faith on herself. She prefers to let her minions do the fighting, and has them stand between her and any approaching foes.
During Combat The priest channels negative energy at groups of foes and uses single-target spells against her most dangerous opponent (typically starting with hold person so her allies can surround the hapless target).
Base Statistics Without shield of faith, the drow's statistics are AC 22, touch 11, flat-footed 21.

Description

Having manipulated and assassinated her way into the middle ranks of her church, the drow priest uses her powers to eliminate rivals as she continues her climb. The drow religious orders are just as cutthroat as every other aspect of drow society. Their priests see the ability to out-scheme one's foes as a sign of the unholy favor of their demonic patrons.

This dark-skinned elf stands in a battle-ready pose, her hair silver and eyes white and pupilless.
