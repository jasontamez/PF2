Special Abilities

Ego Drain (Su) A calpina grappling a foe feeds on her target's ego at the end of its turn, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Once a calpina has dealt an amount of Charisma damage equal to her Constitution score, she is fully sated and cannot use this ability again for 24 hours.

Fragrant Haze (Su) As a standard action, a calpina can release magical vapors that cause stupor and vertigo in creatures other than calpinas or their larvae. Each living creature within 20 feet must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be exhausted for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that calpina's fragrant haze for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Calpinas are strange fey whose bodies have a combination of insectile and humanoid features. They view their victims as little more than sources of nutrition, but remain intensely curious creatures and may sometimes, albeit rarely, interact with other creatures without harmful intentions.

Calpinas make simple nests in hollow, rotting trees or shallow caves in cliff sides at the lower altitudes of mountains. Their social and territorial tendencies change with the seasons. In early spring, calpinas become largely solitary and nomadic, wandering in search of appetizing prey. A few months later, when they lay their eggs, calpinas band together into colonies of their own kind for mutual protection of their young. Once the eggs have hatched, though, calpinas welcome visitors, as their larvae require substantial quantities of food to grow. Small groups of calpinas called eclipses often work together to lure victims into ambushes, draining their egos to the last drop before leaving the comatose victims for the fey's mindless offspring to eat.

Calpinas are usually just over 3 feet tall, and most weigh only 25 pounds.

Calpina Larva

Two weeks after being laid, calpina eggs hatch into
caterpillar-like larvae. They grow rapidly, and within a
month of incubation, the surviving larvae each weave a
cocoon. A few weeks after they enter their cocoons, they
emerge as adult calpinas.

The mindless larvae bear little resemblance to the
adults of the species except for their eyes and coloration.
Unlike adult calpinas, the larvae are carnivorous and need
to consume animal tissue before they can pupate and
complete their metamorphosis. Adult calpinas take care to
ensure these larvae are well protected.

A calpina larva has the statistics of a house centipede, except that its type is
fey instead of vermin, and it has DR 2/cold iron.
