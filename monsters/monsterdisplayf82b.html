Special Abilities

Castle (Ex) A behemoth golem has a small stronghold built onto its back. Up to eight Medium creatures can occupy this tower by climbing onto the behemoth golem with a DC 25 Climb check (DC 10 if the golem is willing). A creature occupying the tower can choose either to hide in the castle's interior, gaining total cover as long as it remains within the structure but losing the ability to attack anything outside of the tower, or to stand on the parapet around the perimeter of the tower, gaining partial cover thanks to the battlement surrounding the walkway. A behemoth golem's castle moves with the creature itself, and though creatures occupying the castle count a Behemoth Golem s occupying the same square as the golem, they cannot be engaged in melee unless their opponent is also occupying the castle.
<br />A behemoth golem can shake off unwanted occupants by making a combat maneuver check as a full-round action; any creatures currently occupying the castle must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the result of the behemoth golem's combat maneuver check). Creatures standing on the parapet that fail their save fall out of the castle, landing in the nearest empty square and taking 5d6 points of falling damage (6d6 if standing on the uppermost parapet); creatures hiding within the castle that fail their saves are jumbled about and take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC for half damage).

Immunity to Magic (Su) A behemoth golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature. <ul><li>A stone to flesh spell negates a behemoth golem's damage reduction for 1 round.</li><li>A transmute rock to mud spell slows a behemoth golem as the slow spell for 1d4 rounds (no save).</li><li>A magical attack that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A behemoth golem gets no save against acid effects.</li></ul> Quake (Su) As a standard action once per day, a behemoth golem can stomp its two front feet down, creating a ripple of destruction in a 60-foot cone. This effect is otherwise identical to earthquake (caster level 17th).

Description

Behemoth golems are elephantine constructs once crafted by the artificers of the ancient Jistka Imperium. Rather than use elemental spirits to fuel the constructs' animation, artificers made pacts with demons, daemons, and devils from the evil Outer Planes, and bound their spirits to these titanic horrors to bring them to life. Though from a distance they resemble armored mammoths with a castle attached to their back, a behemoth golem's flesh is in fact made of tons of mined stone, and its tusks and teeth are carved from rare minerals similar in density to ivory.

The main body of a behemoth golem is 40 feet tall, with the highest part of the tower reaching 60 feet.

Construction

While the methods for creating a behemoth golem are largely considered lost along with so much Jistkan lore, a character who finds herself in possession of one of Jistka's fabled behemoth golem manuals gains the knowledge required to construct such a mammoth being. A behemoth golem is built from 70,000 pounds of rocks and rare minerals treated with profane oils worth 25,000 gp.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They stand apart from other constructs in the nature of their animating force-golems are granted their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the will of the golem's creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of another, but the golem's creator can always resume control by commanding the golem to obey him alone.


Constructing a Golem

The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components used in its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the materials required and the total cost for its creation.

Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. Building a golem with the advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.


Shield Guardians

A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the golem's construction-a completed golem cannot later be "upgraded" to function as a shield guardian.

Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so). If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.

Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base golem, but with the following additional special qualities. A shield guardian's CR is equal to the base golem's CR + 2.

Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of its amulet is within 30 feet.

Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.

Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can locate the amulet's wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.

Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.

Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).

Construction: A shield guardian's base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem's cost. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem's kind. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time-it costs 20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian's total cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. The creator must have a minimum caster level of 2 higher than the base golem's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells are added to the base golem's requirements: discern location and either shield or shield other.
