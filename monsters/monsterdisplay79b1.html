Kaiju, Vorgozen

Special Abilities

Absorb Magic (Ex) When a spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome Vorgozen's spell resistance, it is wholly or partially absorbed by the kaiju. If the spell was an area-effect spell or targeted more than just Vorgozen, it functions normally against other targets and Vorgozen regains a number of hit points equal to double the spell's level. If the spell targeted only Vorgozen, she absorbs the entire spell and regains a number of hit points equal to 10 x the spell's level. Whenever Vorgozen absorbs magic in this way, her polluted magic aura grows more powerful (whether or not the absorbed magic healed her of damage); all rolls to determine the effect of polluted magic are modified by +20 for the remainder of the round.

Acid Beam (Su) Once every 4 rounds, Vorgozen can unleash a beam of foul acid. This creates a 1,200-foot line of high pressure caustic fluid. All creatures caught in the area of effect take 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage, and are knocked prone. A creature that succeeds at a DC 43 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone. A Huge or smaller creature that is knocked prone is also pushed away from Vorgozen. A Huge creature is pushed back 10 feet, a Large creature 20 feet, a Medium creature 40 feet, and Small or smaller creatures 80 feet. Creatures that are pushed take 1d6 additional points of bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they are pushed, but can attempt a DC 43 Reflex save to halve this additional damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Infuse Terrain (Su) Once per day as a standard action, Vorgozen can dematerialize and seep into the terrain, infusing it with her polluted nature. The kaiju appears to simply melt into the surrounding terrain when she uses this ability, vanishing from view. The terrain in a 1-mile radius becomes infused with the kaiju's essence-if the terrain is swamp or other wetland, the radius increases to 10 miles. While infusing terrain, Vorgozen cannot be harmed, and all magical effects generated in the region can trigger polluted effects (see Polluted Magic below). Vorgozen remains aware of what takes place in the region of infused terrain, and she can remain infused in the terrain indefinitely, during which time she does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. She can emerge from the terrain at any point within the infused region as a swift action, gaining the benefit of a heal spell (CL 20th) when she does so. Alternatively, she can suppress all effects of her presence on the terrain for up to 24 hours to move at a speed of 50 miles per hour, as per shadow walk. When she ceases moving (typically upon arriving at a region with powerful magic that has drawn her attention), her presence remains suppressed and she cannot move for the remainder of the 24 hours, at which point the suppression ends and her presence again infuses the surrounding terrain.

Polluted Magic (Su) Vorgozen's presence pollutes magic, causing magical abilities to become unreliable when used within 300 feet of the kaiju. When a creature within this area generates a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect, roll on the table below to see how Vorgozen's polluting presence hampers or transforms the effect. Effects created by creatures outside of this 300-foot aura are unaffected by Vorgozen's polluted magic, even if the effect of the spell or supernatural ability enters the area of polluted magic or targets Vorgozen. Likewise, ongoing spell effects or supernatural effects are not polluted when Vorgozen's aura envelops them. Vorgozen's own supernatural abilities never trigger polluted magic effects. <table><tr><th>d%</th> <th>Result</th></tr> <tr><td>1-30</td> <td>The spell or supernatural effect functions normally.</td></tr> <tr><td>31-50</td> <td>The spell or supernatural effect is diluted, functioning at half capacity (caster level, all damage and other randomly determined elements, and durations and areas of effect not determined by caster level are halved); the DCs of saving throws to resist the effect are decreased by 10.</td></tr> <tr><td>51-70</td> <td>The spell or supernatural effect is cancelled and its use for that activation is wasted.</td></tr> <tr><td>71-90</td> <td>The spell or supernatural effect is canceled and its use for that activation is wasted. The creator of the spell or supernatural effect must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The nausea is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</td></tr> <tr><td>91 or higher</td> <td>The spell or supernatural effect is canceled and its use for that activation is wasted. The creator of the spell or supernatural effect must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or suffer the effects of feeblemind (CL 20th). The feeblemind effect is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</td></tr></table>

Swallow Whole (Ex) If a creature that is swallowed whole by Vorgozen manages to escape by cutting itself free, Vorgozen's gelatinous body simply seals over the hole created so that other swallowed creatures must cut their own way out.

Description

Most kaiju are ancient creatures that have dwelled in hidden lairs since the dawn of civilization, prehistoric monsters woken from eons-long slumbers, or alien entities who visit the world only rarely. But Vorgozen (referred to as the Shapeless Feeder by some, and as Queen Vorgozen by those who wish to see all magic abolished from the world) is a relatively recent addition to the world's kaiju. This accidental but overwhelmingly powerful creation was forged from the unfortunate combination of hubris and arrogance. The absolute destruction of the remote academy in an immense fen that gave rise to the Shapeless Feeder left few clues as to the nature of the potent magic the wizards there were toying with. What hints remain suggest it involved reverse-engineering an artifact in an attempt to distill the potent powers held within the core of a once flying city.

Born as she was out of the abuse of magical power, Vorgozen is very much a personification of the arrogant wizard who values the study and mastery of magic and the pursuit of arcane power over all else. The Shapeless Feeder was not content to remain at the epicenter of her accidental creation, and has instead seeped through the world, drawn by powerful magical auras or supernatural foci. Fortunately for civilization, after emerging to destroy, the Shapeless Feeder invariably retreats to vast swamplands such as the site of her genesis to hibernate for decades before rousing once again from her slumber.

The powerful magic of other kaiju's supernatural abilities is particularly coveted by Vorgozen, and she enjoys polluting these effects more than any other. She is often drawn to places where other kaiju rampage as a result.

Queen Vorgozen is an immense mound of protoplasm nearly 80 feet in diameter. She weighs 24,000 tons.

In the furthest reaches of the globe, where civilization itself is a legend and mapmakers can only make guesses about lands and denizens, immense creatures that are worshiped as gods walk the world. Capable of devastating entire cities in a single day of ruin and unleashing powerful supernatural attacks, these fabled, so-called "gods" are anything but. These massive monsters are known as kaiju, and the tales told of their genesis are as varied as the strange forms and capabilities of the monsters themselves.

A kaiju is a monster of tremendous size-far larger than almost any other creature. Each kaiju is unique, but they all share a few traits in common (see the kaiju subtype on page 307). Kaiju can be of different types, but most are magical beasts. Although kaiju are semiintelligent and can generally understand a single language, they cannot speak. Some legends tell of certain gifted or unique people being able to call kaiju from vast distances to aid them in times of distress. This type of bond with a kaiju isn't well understood, but rarely comes to those who already possess great power. Rather, it is the helpless, the compassionate, and the meek who can bring forth kaiju.

Kaiju generally dwell in distant, remote wildernesses, often in unusually close proximity to one another. There they battle, but never quite seem to finish their constant conf licts before one of the beasts staggers away to recover from the clash, defeated only for the moment. Visitors to one of the remote lands where kaiju frequently clash can often explore without too much fear, as long as they take care not to be too visible or destructive as they explore. Unless a kaiju is being attacked or is particularly aggressive (such as when it's defending a territory), it's likely to ignore Medium or smaller creatures that wander in its vicinity, just as a human might ignore an ant crawling nearby.

A kaiju's supernatural metabolism allows it to draw energy and nutrition from sources other than food- each kaiju "feeds" in a different way on a different form of energy, but when denied its energy source it does not starve. Instead, the immense monster simply falls into torpor, hibernating until a new source of energy awakens it once again. In some cases, a kaiju can lie dormant for ages-so long that civilizations have time to unknowingly encroach upon lands the monster claimed long ago as its territory. As long as the new civilizations take care to not accidentally waken the monster, they can coexist with the slumbering kaiju in relative peace for many, many years. Yet eventually, some event will inevitably waken the slumbering giant and call it forth into a rampage.

Certain events can drive a kaiju into a destructive frenzy. Powerful storms or natural disasters, rare and dangerous rituals designed to call out to them, the use of incredibly powerful magical weapons, wars, and the approach of other kaiju can all send one of these creatures on a rampage of wrath. When a kaiju begins such a rampage, it leaves its remote wilderness home and travels far afield, often for hundreds or even thousands of miles through unexplored wilds or across entire oceans until it reaches the source of the irritation.

Upon arriving in such a location, the kaiju seeks out the source of whatever enraged it, or if no obvious source is apparent, it simply tramples a path of destruction through whatever city or fortress or locale happens to be in its way. Once a kaiju's rampage begins, it can last for weeks, with the monster periodically retreating between attacks into wildernesses or oceans near the source of the disturbance to rest or recuperate.

Societies that are frequently plagued by kaiju attacks often build special magical siege engines designed to drive off the monster, or even seek to recruit the aid of other kaiju to battle the intruder. Unfortunately, the collateral damage caused by multiple kaiju is significant, and fighting fire with fire in this way may leave behind nothing but rubble.

All kaiju are Colossal, and have a space and reach of no less than 50 feet each. A bipedal kaiju typically stands between 100 and 200 feet in height; quadrupedal kaiju are half as tall. A kaiju's size makes a battle against one challenging to run. At the scale needed to track tactical movement for Medium creatures, a kaiju takes up a massive amount of space. When designing an encounter with a kaiju, plan ahead and prepare a larger area so that you can track the kaiju's movement effectively.
