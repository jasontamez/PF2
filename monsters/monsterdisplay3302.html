Ogre - Monsters







Ogre

This lumbering giant's beady eyes are devoid of wit or kindness, and its puffy face features a wide mouth with ill-fitting teeth.

Description

Stories are told of ogres-horrendous stories of brutality and savagery, cannibalism and torture. Of rape and dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation, and all manners of hideous murder. Those who have not encountered ogres know the stories as warnings. Those who have survived such encounters know these tales to be tame compared to the truth.

An ogre revels in the misery of others. When smaller races aren't available to crush between meaty fists or defile in blood-red lusts of violence, they turn to each other for entertainment. Nothing is taboo in ogre society. One would think that, left to themselves, an ogre tribe would quickly tear itself apart, with only the strongest surviving in the end-yet if there is one thing ogres respect, it is family.

Ogre tribes are known as families, and many of their deformities and hideous features arise from the common practice of incest. The leader of a tribe is most often the father of the tribe, although in some cases a particularly violent or domineering ogress claims the title of mother. Ogre tribes bicker among themselves, a trait that thankfully keeps them busy and turned against each other rather than neighboring races. Yet time and again, a particularly violent and feared patriarch rises among the ogres, one capable of gathering multiple families under his command.

Regions inhabited by ogres are dreary, ugly places, for these giants dwell in squalor and see little need to live in harmony with their environment. The borderland between civilization and ogre territory is a desperate realm of outcasts and despair, for here dwell the ogrekin, the deformed offspring and results of frequent ogre raids against the lands of the smaller folk.

Ogre games are violent and cruel, and victims they use for entertainment are lucky if they die the first day. Ogres' cruel senses of humor are the only way their crude minds show any spark of creativity, and the tools and methods of torture ogres devise are always nightmarish.

An ogre's great strength and lack of imagination makes it particularly suited for heavy labor, such as mining, forging, and clearing land, and more powerful giants (particularly hill giants and stone giants) often subjugate ogre families to serve them in such regards.

A typical adult ogre stands 10 feet tall and weighs roughly 650 pounds.

Whether it's due to inbreeding, magical or alchemical experimentation, or strange environs, ogres are far more prone to mutations than other races. Ogres can survive with defects that would outright kill members of most other species. Below is a small sample of mutations that might be seen among ogres in a clan.

Pickin (CR +0)

These tall, bone-thin ogres have thick, bark-like skin and spiked growths all over their bodies, and their hands end in sharp, thorn-like claws.

Rebuild Rules: Ability Scores -2 Constitution, +2 natural armor bonus; Attacks gains 2 claw attacks (1d6); Special +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks in forests.

Rebuild Rules: Ability Scores -2 Dexterity; Attacks gains a bite attack (1d8) .

Shaggra (CR +1)

Ogres with the shaggra template are covered in long, matted fur, and have stunted legs and massive oversized arms, similar to apes. They move on all fours and smash enemies with their giant fists.

Quick Rules: +2 on all attack rolls, damage rolls, and Strength checks; gains two slam attacks (1d6); gains the grab and constrict monster special abilities.

Ogres sometimes interbreed with other giants. The result of such crossbreeding is a giantkin ogre, which gains some abilities from its non-ogre parents. In areas where ogre clans live near large populations of giants, interbreeding can be so common that entire ogre clans consist solely of giantkin.

Giantkin (CR +1)

Blessed with the blood of greater giants, giantkin ogres are larger and stronger than their normal ogre relatives and gain abilities from their giant progenitors.

Rebuild Rules: Hit points +10 hit points; Saving Throws +1 racial bonus to all saving throws; Ability Scores +4 Strength, +4 Constitution; Special Attacks rock throwing (1d6, 90 ft.), Special see table.
