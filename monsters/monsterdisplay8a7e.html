Special Abilities

Gulp (Ex) A stargazer can open its giant mouth in a fraction of a second, creating a vortex that draws a target into its maw. When underwater, a stargazer gains 5 additional feet of reach with its bite attack and a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple.

Poison (Ex) Venomous spines-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect sickened for 1d4 rounds; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Shock (Ex) A stargazer delivers an electrical shock with each successful bite attack, dealing an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage.

Venomous Spines (Ex) A stargazer has two large venomous spines situated behind its head. The stargazer reacts swiftly to attacks, stabbing at any creature that attempts to harm it. Each time a creature attacks a stargazer with a natural weapon, unarmed strike, or weapon attack that doesn't have reach, it must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or be hit by one of these spines. Each time a creature is hit by a spine, it takes 1d4 points of piercing damage and is exposed to the stargazer's poison. A creature that grapples a stargazer is automatically hit by these spines. The save DC to avoid the spines is Dexterity-based.

Description

A giant stargazer is an ambush predator with a speckled, flattened body that hunts by burying itself in the sand, leaving just its eyes and mouth uncovered. A typical giant stargazer is 6 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.
