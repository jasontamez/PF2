Special Abilities

Guardian Sword and Shield (Su) The pharaonic guardian can imbue any Large sword and shield with the ghost touch and speed special abilities and a +3 enhancement bonus. This effect lasts for as long as the guardian wields them and for 1 minute thereafter. The guardian uses these items as if it had a Strength score equal to its Charisma score.
Insightful Strike (Ex) The pharaonic guardian gains a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls against foes whose thoughts it has read via its judging gaze ability.
Judging Gaze (Su) The pharaonic guardian's gaze attack allows it to read the minds of those within 30 feet, as per the detect thoughts spell with 3 rounds of concentration (Will DC 22 negates). This is a mind-affecting divination effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
Soul-Rending Wings (Su) As a standard action every 1d4 rounds, the pharaonic guardian can flare its wings to fire rays of soul-cutting light in two 30-foot lines extending away from it. Living creatures in the lines take 1d4 negative levels (Reflex DC 22 negates). A creature whose thoughts the pharaonic guardian has read via its judging gaze ability takes a -2 penalty on this save. The Fortitude save to remove these negative levels is also DC 22, though without the -2 penalty from judging gaze. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Description

Created only by the most evil and egotistical pharaohs, pharaonic guardians are elite protectors of tombs and other monuments. Much like the grand buildings they inhabit, pharaonic guardians are the product of fear and sweat wrung from slaves and other servants. To make one, a pharaoh uses rare arcane processes to draw out the souls of obedient servants, capturing both their fear of death and fear of eternal damnation should they disobey their god-rulers. The pharaoh then blends these essences together into towering, animal-headed warriors whose only purpose is guarding a royal location for eternity.
