Many bugbear sneaks serve as scouts and assassins for hobgoblin armies. They sometimes become enamored of the act of killing itself, and use their natural affinity for moving quietly to become unseen murderers in cities.

This dark-furred creature raises a spiked morningstar, its tiny, milk-white eyes glittering with the thrill of the coming kill.
