Special Abilities

Collapse (Su) As a standard action, a cutlass spider can fall into a heap of blades and parts. Any creature occupying a square adjacent to a cutlass spider when it collapses must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or take 2d6+5 points of slashing and piercing damage. While collapsed, a cutlass spider is considered prone and can take no action other than to reform itself as a standard action. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Shared Enhancement (Su) Should a cutlass spider have a magical weapon incorporated into its body (either given to it by its creator or stolen via its weapon thief ability), it applies the weapon's enhancement bonus and special abilities to all of its natural attacks. The construct benefits from the abilities of only the highest-value magical weapon incorporated into its body. For example, a cutlass spider that incorporates a +1 flaming short sword gains a +1 enhancement bonus and the effects of the flaming special ability on its claw and bite attacks. Should it later acquire a +3 holy quarterstaff, the effects of the short sword are replaced, and its claws and bite gain a +3 enhancement bonus and the holy special ability.

Weapon Thief (Ex) A cutlass spider that disarms an opponent incorporates the disarmed weapon into its body. The weapon cannot be retrieved until the cutlass spider is destroyed.

Description

Named for their association with mages in the service of privateer crews and pirate lords, cutlass spiders serve their creators as enforcers, bodyguards, and occasionally assassins. They are 8 feet long and weigh 1,500 pounds.

Construction

A cutlass spider is an amalgam of weapons worked into a cage-like frame of wood or metal. These materials cost a total of 400 gp.
