Special Abilities

Bottle-Bound (Su) A polong is bound to a bottle as part
of the ritual to create it. A polong must remain within 1
mile of its bottle, and regains 1d8+5 hit points for each
hour it spends inside its bottle. If a polong's bottle (AC 11,
hardness 1, hp 1) is destroyed, the polong is considered
staggered until the bottle reforms in 24 hours. Once per
day, a creature that possesses a polong's bottle can attempt
to take control of the polong for 24 hours as if the polong
where under the effect of a dominate monster spell. The
polong can attempt a DC 20 Will save to negate this effect.
A creature that's controlling the polong is immune to its
murderous intent aura.
Murderous Intent (Su) A polong generates a seething
aura of unrestrained violence and malicious intent. As an
immediate action, a polong can attempt an Intimidate check
to demoralize any creature entering its aura. A creature that
doesn't become demoralized is immune to the polong's
aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
Terrible Wounds (Su) A polong's touch deals slashing damage,
and opens up terrible gashes. Each round a creature takes
bleed damage from the polong's touch attack, it must
succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take 2 points of
Constitution damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Polongs are the spirits of murderers who have been
magically bound to a bottle. Whoever possesses a polong's
bottle can command the creature to carry out murderous
acts. Necromancers, cultists, and assassins sometimes use
polongs to perform assassinations from afar. Commanding
polongs is dangerous, however, as their desire to kill makes
them turn on their own masters if given the chance.

When a polong's bottle is opened, the creature manifests
as a blood-drenched spirit with hands transformed into
long claws. Its thirst for violence and murder twists its
distorted features into a hateful visage. Polongs remember
little of their past lives, their own thoughts turned to
committing the heinous acts commanded by their masters.
