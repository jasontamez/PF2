Special Abilities

Archery Expert (Su) A jungle giant is proficient with all bows, and does not provoke an attack of opportunity when firing a bow in melee combat.

Spell Storing (Su) Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle giant can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used against it, negating the effects against it but not against any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to 1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire. If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a free action, as if it were using a spell storing weapon. This spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This discharges the stored spell.

Warding Tattoos (Su) A jungle giant's magical tattoos grant it a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this bonus if it wears armor.

Description

Reclusive by nature, jungle giants lair deep within the rainforest. These giants distrust the ways of civilization and resent trespassers. More than one vine-covered lost city in the deep jungle owes its fall to jungle giant ire. The warrior-women of these tribes usually fight with bows, sacred weapons often passed down over generations from mother to daughter. To touch a jungle giant's bow without permission is a mortal insult.

Jungle giants stand 17 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. Their barklike skin bears runic brands etched into each giant as a rite of passage into adulthood. Jungle giant tribes are matriarchal, ruled by an elder female warrior. Males traditionally defend the village, gather food, tend livestock, and raise children.
