Description

A mythic ettin is descended from a sordid lineage of mythic hill giants, mythic stone giants, and at least one mythic orc. Angrier, filthier, and stronger than other ettins, it is a leader of its kind, and is better at keeping a band or colony together for months or years.

Variant Mythic Ettins

Some mythic ettins are strongly related to one of their ancestral races, and have different mythic abilities.

Hillblood Ettin (CR 8/MR 3)

A hill-giant-dominant mythic ettin loses its powerful charge and stench abilities but gains a mythic hill giant's earth bond and ground pound abilities (see page 200).

Orcblood Ettin (CR 8/MR 3)

An orc-dominant mythic ettin loses its stench and two brains abilities, but gains blood rage and feral savagery (see page 227).

Stoneblood Ettin (CR 8/MR 3)

A stone giant-dominant mythic ettin loses its powerful charge and stench abilities, but gains a stone giant's improved rock catching (Bestiary 151) and rock throwing.
