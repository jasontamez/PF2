Wrap Wings (Ex) When a lamhigyn uses its wing attacks to
grab an opponent, it wraps its wings around its target's
head, causing the victim to gain the blinded condition for
as long as the lamhigyn grapples that creature. This ability
has no effect on creatures that do not have sensory organs
in their heads.

Description

Lamhigyns are simple pests that emerged from the
chaotic fabric of the Abyss. They poison their prey until
it falls into a coma, and then they slowly tear it apart,
piece by piece, with their rasping mouths. Lamhigyns
view intruders on their territory with disdain, and their
stings have left many adventurers insane and debilitated,
opportune victims for the Abyss's insatiable predators.
Though lamhigyns might not appear frightening on their
own, greater terrors sometimes follow in their wakes,
hoping for easy meals.

Lamhigyns are strange-looking creatures often
characterized by mortals visiting the Abyss as overgrown,
flying tadpoles with bat wings and stinger-tipped
tails. They lurk within dark places in the Abyss and in
similarly lightless places on the Material Plane near
rifts to their home plane. Their bulbous, unblinking
eyes are vaguely froglike, and are often the last things
unprepared adventurers see, as the pesky creatures are
fond of wrapping their wings around their victims-
heads to blind their prey. Their tiny mouths house thick
tongues that flick about in the presence of prey.

Lamhigyns have thick, scaly skin ranging in color
from red to green. Though lamhigyns are typically
encountered flying, on the ground they stand on four
insectile legs that they keep tucked beneath them while
nesting. Although they are small, their 2-foot-high,
8-pound bodies are impressive sights when hurtling
through the air at their victims.

When it comes to their own kind, lamhigyns can be
quite volatile. In general, they tend to get along with other
lamhigyns, though almost anything can set them off.
When this happens, lamhigyns unleash the full force of
their chaotic fury on each other, stinging and grappling
until only one-or sometimes none-of the bizarre
creatures remain.

When they're not fighting among themselves,
lamhigyns live together in noisy, flapping hives, waiting
for hapless creatures to stumble into their dens. When
it comes to victims, lamhigyns prefer those that can
think and walk, for they provide the most deliciously
terrif ied reactions. There is nothing lamhigyns love
more than injecting their mind-numbing toxin into
terrif ied victims while they ineffectually scream and
flail. Lamhigyns ignore most normal animals unless
they have waited too long for fresh prey and have grown
bored. Sometimes, however, a particularly large hive of
lamhigyns will attempt to bring down large, imposing
creatures simply for the challenge of it.
