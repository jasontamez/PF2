Special Abilities

Force Field (Ex) A surgeon robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a surgeon robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the surgeon robot is immune to critical hits. A surgeon robot's force field has fast healing 15, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.

Master Surgeon (Ex) Programmed to execute advanced medical procedures, a surgeon robot can perform surgeries and other procedures that heal humanoid creatures of all manner of maladies. A surgeon robot can heal wounds, set broken bones, cure diseases, treat burns, remove poison, and even install cybertech items. These procedures take varying amounts of time for the surgeon robot to complete and require different Heal check DCs. The DCs for these surgical procedures increase by 10 when they're performed on a non-humanoid creature. These procedures leave the patient with the exhausted condition. If the surgeon robot fails any of its Heal checks, the surgery fails and the patient takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and is exhausted for 24 hours. The procedures a surgeon robot can perform are as follows: <ul><li>Cure Blindness/Deafness (DC 35): The patient's sight or hearing is restored. Required Time: 30 minutes.</li><li>Install Cybertech (DC = 5 + the cybertech install DC): Cybernetic equipment is installed safely. Required Time: 20 minutes per point of implantation of the cybertech being installed.</li><li>Minor Surgery (DC 25): The patient is healed of 1d8+1 points of damage. Required Time: 5 minutes.</li><li>Moderate Surgery (DC 30): The patient is healed of 2d8+3 points of damage and 1d4+1 points of ability damage to a selected ability score. Required Time: 10 minutes.</li><li>Major Surgery (DC 35): The patient is healed of 3d8+5 points of damage and is cured of blindness and deafness. Required Time: 15 minutes.</li><li>Critical Surgery (DC 40): The patient is healed of 4d8+7 points of damage and either all ability damage to all ability scores or all ability drain to one ability score. Required Time: 30 minutes.</li><li>Treat Toxin (DC = 10 + the save DC of disease or poison): One disease or poison currently afflicting the patient is removed. Required Time: 10 minutes.</li></ul>

Specialized Programming (Ex) Heal is always a class skill for surgeon robots, and they gain a +8 racial bonus on Heal checks.

Superior Optics (Ex) Surgeon robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.

Syringe (Ex) When a surgeon robot makes a successful attack with its syringe, it can inject the target with pharmaceuticals. The robot contains nanites that fabricate the pharmaceuticals stored within its body. Up to 10 doses of these pharmaceuticals can be administered per day. The surgeon robot can choose to affect its target with cardioamp, cureall, hemochem (grade III), torpinal, or zortaphen each time it uses this ability. Rules for these pharmaceuticals can be found on pages 33-34 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide.

Description

These large, insectoid-looking robots were designed to perform incredibly complicated surgeries with flawless results. Possessing a data bank filled with advanced surgical techniques, these robots produce nearly supernatural effects, and the recovery time from their procedures is often nothing short of miraculous. These robots were originally stationed on Divinity to care for the humanoid crew of the ship during their long voyage, and some were even employed to treat the aliens the ship collected during its journey. Surgeon robots stand 7 feet tall and weigh a bit more than 600 pounds.

Ecology

Formed from a skeletal array of gleaming metal, surgeon robots can contort their forms to accommodate various positions needed to most effectively perform surgical procedures on their patients. Though the robot is capable of standing upright and extending its body to a height of 10 feet, it usually stands on four legs when working for increased stability. In this posture, the surgeon robot resembles an oversized preying mantis. Surgeon robots are equipped with powerful and precise rotors that allow them to fly if necessary. This added movement allows surgeon robots to treat patients in precarious locations during emergency situations.

Surgeon robots possess remarkable speed, dexterity, and structural strength, and their design makes them highly adaptable. In addition to sensory inputs that exceed the senses of most living creatures, its creators also added a nanite-powered pharmaceutical lab that is housed deep in the robot's body. Each of its limbs-though seemingly delicate-is crafted from remarkably durable metal that flexes to prevent breakage if the robot attempts to lift more than it can normally carry. Thin claws extend from its two primary limbs, allowing it to deftly and precisely maneuver a patient into the optimal position for each of the dizzying number of procedures the robot is capable of performing. Should a surgeon robot need to defend itself or its patient, its claws are also more than ample weapons.

Some surgeon robots have been reprogrammed to accommodate different sorts of patients. Due to exposure to alien creatures or training given by those expecting to venture into places with non-humanoid creatures, the robots contain detailed information on alien physiologies. These surgeon robots can perform surgical procedures on non-humanoid creatures with no increase to the Heal DC.

Habitat and Society

The Technic League has spent a great deal of effort recovering and reprogramming these robots for its own purposes, which are not limited to simple healing and surgery. Aside from medicine, Technic League agents use these robots as torturers during painful interrogations, or take advantage of the robots' pharmaceutical production to keep subjects drugged for months at a time. Despite such alternate uses, these intelligent constructs have a hardwired directive that Technic League agents have failed to deactivate: an obsessive drive to perfect their craft. Surgeon robots continually attempt to study humanoid physiology. They require new subject matter to study with some regularity, and if denied such opportunities, they take it upon themselves to collect specimens and perform experiments on them-sometimes claiming the same Technic League agents who tried to cow them.

These robots are most commonly encountered in Silver Mount, among the Technic League compound in Starfall, or hidden away inside other ruins of Divinity's crash where they once were stationed to provide medical care. However, rogue surgeon robots may also be found in dungeons or caves that they've transformed into their own macabre operating rooms filled with all manner of strange and alien technological devices. On rare occasions, these beings form pacts with other intelligent creatures, bartering their services as surgeons in return for both materials and test subjects. Lacking any sort of conscience or ethical code, surgeon robots make excellent torturers and executioners.

Products of technology advanced far beyond even those of the gunsmiths of Alkenstar, robots represent constructs animated by engineering and advanced science rather than magic. The people of Golarion think of robots as "automatons" or "metal men"-their proper nomenclature is known to only a few.

The first robots arrived untold years ago, when a ship from beyond the stars smashed into Golarion. The metal vessel entered the atmosphere in a blaze of fire and broke apart, scattering fragments across the plains of Numeria. Over the following centuries, several varieties of robots emerged or were recovered from some of these ruins. A few still follow the alien dictates of their original programming, while others run amok, their directives corrupted or forgotten. Perhaps the best-known robots are the fabled gearsmen, a veritable army of humanoid robots found stored and awaiting orders in a massive hold in Silver Mount.

The means of commanding robots vary from model to model, a source of endless frustration for Numerian artificers. Some obey orders from any humanoid, some bond to a specific master until her death, and others yield only to the command of brooches or rods recovered from Silver Mount. Still others submit after mechanical surgery, or not all. A surprisingly large fraction of uncontrolled robots already speak Common or Hallit. Most models exhibit considerable linguistic talents, and the robots train each other in their new home's languages. Despite comprehending Numerian languages, most robots rarely speak save for terse acknowledgments and orders.

The Robot Subtype

"Robot" is a special subtype that can be applied to any construct without changing its CR. Robots share some features with clockwork constructs (The Inner Sea World Guide 256), and as with clockworks, you can simply remove the robot subtype and its traits to transform it into a typical construct animated by magic. A construct cannot possess both the robot and the clockwork subtypes. All robots gain the following traits, unless noted otherwise. <ul><li>Intelligent: Robots are intelligent, and thus have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice. Unless otherwise indicated for a specific robot, all robots have Intelligence scores of 10. The following are class skills for robots: Climb, Disable Device, Fly, Knowledge (all), Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive.</li><li>Vulnerable to Critical Hits: Whenever a robot takes extra damage from a critical hit, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. If it makes a successful saving throw, it is staggered for 1 round. The robot remains immune to other sources of the stunned condition.</li><li>Vulnerable to Electricity: Robots take 150% as much damage as normal from electricity attacks, unless they are immune to electricity via other special defenses.</li><li>Difficult to Create: Robots are crafted via complex methods hidden and well guarded in Numerian ruins or other technological bastions. While the Technic League has developed magical solutions to some of these requirements, actual details on creating robots are beyond the scope of this book.</li></ul>

Numerian Technology

Miraculous and deadly treasures lie in wait in Numerian dungeons, and the robots that dwell there often utilize these technological arms and tools themselves. A robot's weapons and defenses are fueled by its central energy core, and unless otherwise indicated, a robot's weapons and defenses have infinite ammunition and power.

Force Fields: A force field sheathes a robot in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants a number of bonus hit points that varies according to the robot (typically 5 x the robot's CR). All damage dealt to a robot with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. A force field has fast healing equal to the robot's CR, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.

Integrated Weaponry: A robot that has a technological weapon (such as a laser rifle or chain gun) built into its body treats such weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons attacks, and cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. Integrated weaponry can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but as a general rule cannot be harvested for use outside of the robot's body once the robot is destroyed. A robot is always proficient with its integrated weapons. Integrated ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat.

Laser Weapons: These weapons emit beams of intensely focused light waves that resolve as touch attacks and deal fire damage. A laser can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.

Plasma Weapons: These weapons emit bursts of superheated, electrically charged gas known as plasma. A plasma weapon's attacks resolve as touch attacks. Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is electricity damage.

Products of advanced scientific technology, the constructs called robots are animated by engineering and advanced science rather than magic. Most people refer to robots as "automatons" or "metal men"; their proper nomenclature is known to only a few. Unlike most constructs, robots are capable of independent thought. However, they still must obey the programming instilled in them at their creation. Any robot whose creator hard-coded limitations into its programming can never be truly autonomous.

Robots almost always arise from cultures that possess technology that is leaps and bounds ahead of other civilizations, though sometimes they appear due to cultural diffusion from such a society. A wrecked spacecraft, a portal through time, or a group of robots mass-producing others of their kind could all bring robots into a world. Robots that appear from another place or time might still follow the alien dictates of their original programming, or could run amok, their directives corrupted or forgotten. Whatever the case, these robots possess technology that is beyond the means of almost anyone to reproduce, and they represent a stark contrast to other constructs, as they have nothing to do with magic.

Some spellcasters, despite lacking any real grasp on the technological principles required to create robots, have managed to create their own robots by cobbling together spare parts and broken machines, filling in the gaps and completing the design with a mixture of magic and barely understood fragments of science. These inferior designs usually lack the inexhaustible power supplies, advanced intellects, and self-repair systems found in the original robots, and the magic used in their creation can potentially render them more susceptible to techniques that work against other sorts of constructs.

Robots serve a wide range of purposes, from warfare and defense to peaceful tasks like excavation, farming, and maintenance. Small villages that find robots and somehow manage to command them will often put them to work quietly tending fields or constructing buildings all day long. Armies and warlords collect the more dangerous varieties of robots, but even the more ordinary varieties can be deadly. Most robots sport alloyed skin as hard as steel, meaning that even the lowliest worker robot presents a potent threat when altered for battle. Furthermore, since most cultures lack a means to reliably repair or understand how to command robots, even the most benign one might malfunction, or even reach a point in its programming where it changes its activity and refuses to follow orders, leading to untold death and destruction among the its former temporary masters.

The means of commanding robots vary from model to model, which can be a source of endless frustration for any who seek to control them. Some obey orders from any humanoid, some bond to a specific master until her death, and others only yield to the command of technological brooches or control rods. Still others submit after mechanical surgery or rebuilding, or not at all. Many must be given extremely precise instructions, for they are unable to process metaphors or other figures of speech, and may interpret them in unanticipated ways, much to the chagrin of those who would command them. A surprisingly large proportion of uncontrolled robots already speak Common, as most models exhibit considerable linguistics talent, and the robots train each other in their new home's languages. Though they comprehend language, most robots rarely speak save for terse acknowledgements of orders. Their speech typically excludes words they deem unnecessary with their mechanical efficiency, leading to strange disjointed statements that convey the requisite information without emotion, although some robots programmed to interact well with humans are able to speak in a more fluid and less disconcerting manner.

Constructing a robot requires no magic, but does involve advanced and extraordinarily rare materials and technological expertise. Because almost no one possesses the skills and materials to complete the process of constructing a robot, these entries omit the construction sections provided for most constructs. A GM can add the robot subtype to a different type of construct, such as an animated object or homunculus, to create new types of robots. Typically, this doesn't alter the construct's CR. A character can't create a robot from or add the robot subtype to a construct that has already been created; adding the <a href="monstersubtypes338d.html?ItemName=Robot">robot subtype</a> to an existing creature is purely a means for the GM to simulate additional robots beyond those provided here.
