Hellbound creatures have consigned their souls to Hell in exchange for infernal power. A hellbound creature's Hit Dice determine what type of devil it can summon with its summon spell-like ability and the summon ability's spell level. It can instead choose to summon 1d3 devils of the next weaker category, or 1d4+1 devils of two categories weaker.
