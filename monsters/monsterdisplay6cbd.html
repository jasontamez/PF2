Special Abilities

Berserk (Ex) When a dragonhide golem enters combat, there is a cumulative 2% chance each round that the lingering primal presence in its draconic grafts overwhelms the golem, causing it to go berserk. It takes 1 minute of inactivity by the golem to reset the golem's berserk chance to 0%; alternatively, the creator can offer the golem a tribute of coins and gems in an attempt to calm the lingering draconic presence. For every 500 gp offered in tribute, the golem's berserk chance is lowered by 1%. Once berserk, the uncontrolled golem goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach, then moving on to spread more destruction. The golem's creator, if within 60 feet, can try to regain control by speaking firmly and persuasively to the golem, requiring a successful DC 25 Charisma check.

Breath Weapon (Su) A dragonhide golem's breath weapon depends on the type of dragon whose head was grafted onto the creature, as summarized on the table below. Regardless of type, a dragonhide golem's breath weapon deals 20d6 points of damage and is usable once every 1d4 rounds. A target that succeeds at a DC 22 Reflex save takes half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

To determine a dragonhide golem's breath weapon randomly, roll 1d10 and consult the table below.

Draconic Grafts Dragonhide golems have several draconic grafts upon their giant bodies to enhance their abilities and defenses. Most dragonhide golems have three draconic grafts; however, the creator can add any number of additional grafts, with each additional graft beyond the third increasing the cost of the golem by 15,000 gp. For every two additional grafts beyond the third, the golem's CR increases by 1. Unless otherwise noted, each draconic graft can be selected only once. Draconic grafts are chosen from those presented below.

Dragonlike Senses (Ex): The dragonhide golem has darkvision out to 120 feet and blindsense out to 60 feet. It can see four times as well as a human in dim light and twice as well in normal light, and it receives a circumstance bonus on Perception checks equal to 5 + the golem's number of Hit Dice. This replaces the golem's standard darkvision of 60 feet and low-light vision.

Elemental Aura (Su): The dragonhide golem's body is surrounded by an aura of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, dealing 2d6 points of energy damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the golem at the start of its turn. The type of energy damage must be the same as one of the golem's breath weapons. This aura can be activated or dismissed as a free action. If the golem has more than one type of breath weapon, it can select the energy type each round.

Full-Body Scales (Ex): The dragonhide golem's body is fully encased in a thick layer of dragon scales, increasing its natural armor bonus by 2 and granting it immunity to a single type of energy (and possibly a vulnerability as well), as determined by the type of dragon the scales are taken from. Silver or white dragons grant immunity to cold, but also vulnerability to fire. Blue or bronze dragons grant immunity to electricity. Brass, gold, or red dragons grant immunity to fire, but also vulnerability to cold. If a dragonhide golem is immune to cold and fire, it loses vulnerability to cold and fire. This draconic graft can be selected any number of times. Each time this draconic graft is selected, it gains an additional +2 natural armor bonus and an additional energy immunity (and possibly a vulnerability as well).

Graft Head (Su): The dragonhide golem's head is formed from one additional type of dragon. Each time this draconic graft is selected, it gains a different type of breath weapon, although the breath weapon is still usable only once every 1d4 rounds. This draconic graft can be selected any number of times.

Powerful Tail (Ex): The dragonhide golem gains a tail attack usable as a secondary attack. It deals 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls with its tail attack.

Wings (Ex): A pair of dragon wings are grafted onto the golem's back, granting a fly speed of 100 feet with clumsy maneuverability. This draconic graft can be selected up to four times. Each additional time this draconic graft is selected, it improves the golem's fly speed by 50 feet and its maneuverability by one step, to a maximum fly speed of 250 feet with good maneuverability.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A dragonhide golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against this creature, as noted below. <ul><li>A <a href="spelldisplay3be0.html?ItemName=flesh%20to%20stone">flesh to stone</a> spell slows a dragonhide golem (as the <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. </li><li>A <a href="spelldisplay77eb.html?ItemName=rage">rage</a> spell increases a dragonhide golem's chance to go berserk by 50%, with no saving throw.</li></ul>

Rampage (Su) Whenever a dragonhide golem goes berserk, its draconic grafts are temporarily empowered. It gains a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, and a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor. This effect ends when the golem's berserk chance is reset to 0%.

Description

A dragonhide golem is a terrifying humanoid monstrosity created from the body of a giant with all manner of parts from dragon corpses grafted onto it.

Construction

A dragonhide golem's body is often built from the corpse of a Huge giant. The draconic grafts are harvested from the bodies of one or more dragons, depending on the dragon's size and the number of grafts to be used. Typically, the process requires no less than one dragon of Huge size, two of Large size, or four of Medium size. Special unguents made from dragon's blood and magical bindings worth 9,000 gp are also required for the grafting process.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They stand apart from other constructs in the nature of their animating force-golems are granted their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the will of the golem's creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of another, but the golem's creator can always resume control by commanding the golem to obey him alone.


Constructing a Golem

The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components used in its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the materials required and the total cost for its creation.

Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. Building a golem with the advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.


Shield Guardians

A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the golem's construction-a completed golem cannot later be "upgraded" to function as a shield guardian.

Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so). If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.

Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base golem, but with the following additional special qualities. A shield guardian's CR is equal to the base golem's CR + 2.

Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of its amulet is within 30 feet.

Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.

Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can locate the amulet's wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.

Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.

Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).

Construction: A shield guardian's base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem's cost. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem's kind. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time-it costs 20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian's total cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. The creator must have a minimum caster level of 2 higher than the base golem's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells are added to the base golem's requirements: discern location and either shield or shield other.
