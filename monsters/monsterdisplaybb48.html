Special Abilities

Bardic Magic (Su) Each day, the Spirit can cast any three bard spells of any level and in any combination (caster level 16th).

Inspiration (Su) The Spirit of Adoration can inspire an intelligent creature by giving it a token of her favor. As long as the creature carries her token, it gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. An inspired bard adds the spirit's Charisma bonus (+6) to his number of bardic performance rounds per day. The spirit retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast the spell status on the carrier. The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action. The spirit may inspire a number of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.

Stunning Ray (Su) This ray of brilliant energy has a range of 180 feet. The target takes 1d8 points of damage and is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Will DC 24 reduces this to dazzled). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Unearthly Grace (Su) The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, as well as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.

Description

The Spirit of Adoration is a personification of resolute love, whose power lifts the heaviest heart and overcomes all obstacles. Her true form is that of a 10-foot-tall, angel-winged woman dressed in flowing clothes and bearing a shining steel glaive.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
