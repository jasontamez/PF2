Description

Gugs are inhuman monstrosities that dwell in the deep places of the world. Whether they were banished to the dark lands by ancient gods or the light-loving races they terrorized, or perhaps were brought to the deep realms by dark powers from some even more inhuman nightmare realm, is unknown, but gugs are loathed by other races for their carnal rites of slaughter.

Gugs are 16 feet tall and weigh nearly 2,000 pounds, but they move with an eerie, unnatural gait as though their limbs contained far too many joints. They can contort and distend their limbs for greater reach or to wriggle easily through impossibly small passages. Gugs may cling for long hours to cave walls or just within dark side-caverns, lying in wait for prey to stumble too close. Their senses are keen, however, and their joy in the bloody hunt is considerable and gugs who catch the scent of blood may stalk their prey for long days, even venturing at times beyond their caves to dare the bright lands of the surface in search of tasty meat to drag back for their horrific sacrifices.

Gugs are savage fighters when driven by a strong leader, but on their own may flee if brought to fewer than half their hit points, carrying off fresh meat for later feasting if they are able. They can subsist on fungi, slimes, and molds as well as carrion and even undead flesh-particularly that of ghouls.

Some bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their alien patrons. These monsters are known as savants. They have a Charisma of 18 and can use invisibility, spike stones, transmute rock to mud, and unholy blight once per day each as spell-like abilities (CL 10th, concentration +14). Some become actual clerics or oracles of their mad gods'strange powers of darkness, insanity, and blood. Gug savants add +1 to their CR.

Variant Gugs

First appearing in H. P. Lovecraft's novella, The Dream- Quest of Unknown Kadath, gugs have their roots in the popular Cthulhu mythos. The background for gugs presented in this article matches the gug backstory presented in the writings of Lovecraft, but their added history on Golarion has led to some unique variants, in addition to the already described savants.

Elder Gug (+1 CR): The oldest gugs, often native to the Dreamlands themselves and living well beyond the normal life span of their kin, develop into wickedly large creatures known as gug elders. Gug elders are larger in stature than their lesser kin, and possess wickedly sharp talons. To represent an elder gug, apply the giant simple template and increase the critical threat range of the gug's claws to 19-20.

Psychic Gug (+1 CR): Gugs exposed to psychic entities over prolonged periods often exhibit similar powers. The most common method by which a gug develops psychic powers is through an extended period of mental domination, during which the gug's mind gains rudimentary psychic powers. Psychic gugs gain the following abilities: Psychic Magic (CL 14th; concentration +17) 15 PE-babble (3 PE, DC 16), burst of adrenaline (3 PE), inflict pain (2 PE, DC 15), primal regression (6 PE, DC 19).
