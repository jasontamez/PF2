Special Abilities

Spit (Ex) Once per hour, a llama can regurgitate the contents of its stomach, spitting the foul material at a single target within 10 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Perhaps llamas' most distinctive feature is their long necks. Rival males violently bump their necks against one another during fights for dominance among the herd, but overall these social animals are remarkably tame.
