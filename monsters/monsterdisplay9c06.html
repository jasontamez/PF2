Special Abilities

Razmiri Aversion (Ex) The Razmiri conditioning received in life is difficult for an apostasy wraith to overcome. If confronted by a Razmiri priest or anyone successfully disguised in that garb, the apostasy wraith must make a Will save. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Hit Dice + the Charisma modifier of the highest-level Razmiri priest present. The apostasy wraith needs to make this saving throw only once per encounter, regardless of the number of Razmiri priests present. If the saving throw fails, the apostasy wraith is forced to flee as if affected by the Turn Undead feat. If the save is successful, it overcomes its aversion and gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and deals double damage against Razmiri priests (or those disguised as such) for the duration of the encounter.

Rend Faith (Su) On a successful incorporeal touch attack against a foe with divine spellcasting abilities, the ability to channel energy, or other divinely granted special abilities, the apostasy wraith's inherent spite and contempt toward all things religious disrupts the target's connection with his deity. The victim must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be unable to use any such ability for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Sense Apostate (Su) An apostasy wraith can sense the presence and direction of Razmiri priests as if using the locate creature spell (CL 20th). This ability cannot be dispelled.

Description

When the souls of the followers of the Living God Razmir reach Pharasma's Court, most are bound for the Inner Court, where their ultimate fate as believers of a false god is decided. These mortal souls are so traumatized by the knowledge of the falseness of their faith that they know only the desire to avenge themselves upon those who so duped them in life. These souls disavow the legitimacy of all gods, and return to the Material Plane to sow their vengeance.

An apostasy wraith exists in a state of constant conflict, torn between its burning shame at falling for such duplicity in life and its scorn and hatred toward believers for whom faith proved to be genuine. Their primary motivation is to wreak vengeance upon the false priesthood of Razmir, but that faith's mental conditioning is so effective as to make it difficult for an apostasy wraith to even approach its quarry. If able to overcome its aversion, its wrath is terrible. Otherwise, an apostasy wraith gladly vents its rage upon followers of other gods in an effort to make them see-even if only for a moment-the despair of finding one's faith misplaced.
