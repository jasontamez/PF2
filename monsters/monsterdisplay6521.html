Description

A typical giant eagle stands about 15 feet tall, has a wingspan of up to 30 feet, and resembles its smaller cousins in nearly every way except size. It weighs 500 pounds.

Giant eagles are far more than animals-they possess a supernatural intellect and view themselves as guardians and protectors of their mountain territories. They form lasting friendships with those who respect them and their mountaintop domains.
