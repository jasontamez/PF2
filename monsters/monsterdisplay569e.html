Tactics

Before Combat The warren guard drinks her potion of barkskin if she believes danger is coming.
During Combat With a single-minded devotion to protecting the tribe's eggs, the warren guard rages and starts attacking with her natural attacks. She uses intimidating glare, following it up with terrifying howl once one or two enemies are shaken. If enemies approach the eggs, she uses knockback to drive them away or grapples them to get them under control.

Description

Troglodyte tribes trust only their most powerful members to look after the tribe's future members. Warren guards care for all of the tribe's eggs except those that are badly flawed; the warren guards consume eggs that will not hatch or that will likely result in a weak or sickly hatchling to ensure the future strength of the tribe. Despite warren guards' usual impartiality, religious leaders in the tribe are sometimes able to arrange for preferential treatment for eggs they laid or fertilized. This stops, however, at getting a warmer position for their eggs. A leader who tries to destroy a rival's eggs by pressuring or bribing a warren guard almost invariably draws that guard's wrath. These hulking, savage troglodytes fight with only tooth and claw. They're devoted to guarding the egg clutches, and leave their warrens only if all of the eggs have been destroyed. When set loose from this obligation, warren guards are feral, uncontrolled, and extremely dangerous.
