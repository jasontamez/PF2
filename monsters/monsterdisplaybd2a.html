Special Abilities

Armor Plating (Su) The armor plates covering much of a
gallu's body grant it a +8 armor bonus. They also function
as armor spikes during grapples, but cannot be used as offhand
weapons. In addition, these armor plates can possess
one additional armor special ability chosen from the
following options: acid resistance 20, cold resistance 20,
fire resistance 20, ghost touch, moderate fortification, or
sonic resistance 20. A gallu demon can switch the active
armor special quality once per hour as a swift action-as
a general rule, the gallu demon keeps the armor plating
set to moderate fortification. These armor plates do not
encumber the gallu or impose armor check penalties,
maximum Dex bonuses, or arcane spell failure chances.
They cannot be removed, sundered, or destroyed while the
gallu lives, and they rust away into nonmagical fragments
of iron upon the gallu's death.


Aura of Havoc (Su) A gallu's presence wreaks havoc, infusing
battlefields with elements of chaos and entropy that disrupt
careful coordination and tactical plotting by manipulating
fate and chance. This aura extends to a 30-foot radius
around the gallu. The aid another action can never grant
bonuses in this area, nor does flanking grant bonuses to
hit in the affected area (although flanked foes remain
susceptible to sneak attack damage). A creature summoned
into this area by any creature other than a demon must
succeed at a DC 26 Will save to avoid being confused for
1d4 rounds. Paladins and creatures with the lawful subtype
must make a DC 26 Will save each round they begin their
turn in this aura to avoid being nauseated for 1 round.
Demons ignore the effects of a gallu's aura of havoc. The
save DCs are Charisma-based.


Rain of Blood (Su) As a standard action once per minute, a
gallu can command the wounds of all creatures within 30
feet to erupt into a gory deluge of blood; any wounded
creature in the area of effect immediately takes 3d6 points
of damage from the rain of blood and must succeed at a
DC 31 Fortitude saving throw. Failure indicates that the
damage becomes bleed damage and the affected creature
becomes staggered from the pain as long as the bleed
damage continues. Creatures that are immune to bleed
damage are immune to this ability's effects. The save DCs
are Constitution-based.


Wounding Blood (Su) The spikes that hold a gallu's armor
plates in place extend as far into the demon's body as they
do outside of it, causing rivulets of blood to constantly
run from the creature's flesh. This continual bleeding does
not inconvenience or harm the gallu; instead, it grants
the wounding special ability to all manufactured weapons
wielded by the gallu. The dripping blood does not affect the
gallu's natural attacks.


Description

On the endless battlefields of the Abyss, the demon
lords' vast armies clash and tear at each other in horrific
displays of warfare and bloodshed. These conflicts often
arise from border disputes between demonic realms, or
when one demon lord finds an excuse to attack another.
But many of these immense wars have no good reason
at all, for gallus eagerly foment war for war's sake; they
are master engineers of martial strife. These hateful,
destructive demons arise from the souls of warmongers
and war profiteers-nefarious leaders, corrupt priests, or
subversive merchants who used their power to perpetuate
existing wars or even to trigger new ones, all for the
express purpose of personal gain or sadistic pleasure.


Known to some as warmonger demons, the gallus are
not as enormous as many of the other powerful demons;
despite their near-human size, however, they are among
the deadliest of demonkind. Standing 8 feet tall and
weighing 450 pounds, these creatures have wolf like (but
hairless) horned heads, batlike wings, and pale flesh.
Their feet end in hooves, and their tails resemble those
of lions. Gallus can assume humanoid shape as well, and
typically do so when interacting with mortals, allowing
them to more easily sow seeds of war among those they
interact with.


These demons are relatively difficult to summon-
gate spells can conjure them from the Abyss, but
few other mortal spells can call them forth. As
a result, most gallus encountered outside the
Abyss have traveled there via portals or similar
methods. Gallus are innately crafty creatures;
when coming to a new world, they resist
their natural urges to destroy in favor of
infiltration. Extraordinarily patient, they can
spend decades or more in disguise as they
subtly build their inf luence and acquire
positions of power; they then use those
positions to incite government officials
and other powerful individuals to wage
war on their neighbors. Only when the
hostilities have completely devastated
their host, leaving it in smoking ruins,
do gallus shed their human flesh and
appear in their true form to gloat and
torment the conflict's few survivors
before moving on to seek fresh victims.


In the Worldwound, gallus serve an
additional role as commanders in the
numerous demonic armies. Many control
multiple divisions, each led by a marilith
general, and report in turn to one of the
Worldwound's leaders, like Khorramzadeh,
Areelu, or Aponavicius. But not all of the
Worldwound's gallus command armies. Those
who serve Baphomet primarily utilize their deceptive
natures to infiltrate various Mendevian mercenary
orders, Mammoth Lord barbarian tribes, settlements on
the fringes of more civilized lands, and other factions
arrayed against the Worldwound. From within those
groups, they serve as advisors, urging those they've
infiltrated into launching ill-timed or poorly planned
attacks on their demonic foes. These gallus occasionally
feed their humanoid "allies" legitimate intelligence about
demonic fortifications or troop movements, knowing
that a little truth can go a long way in encouraging
mortals to act upon their more violent urges.

Demons exist for one reason-to destroy. Where their more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape them into reflections of their own evil, demons seek only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy-for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon's depredations and flee to his just reward in the afterlife. It is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels a demon's lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.

Demons are the most prolific and among the most destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across the multiverse as the Abyss. Before the first fledgling deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully formed, the Abyss was infested with life.

Known to many scholars as "proto-demons," these wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, because of the influence of sinful mortal souls upon the Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the daemonic keepers of Abaddon and the cruel whims of fate and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the demonic hordes grows-a single soul can fuel the manifestation of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes and roles of the newly formed fiends.

The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the Maelstrom itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. Some flop on land while others flap in air or sea. Some are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work to the same goal-pain and suffering for mortal life in all its forms.

Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most demons find ways to twist their summoners' demands so that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks free of his control.

The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic sires to gift them with horrific children are common enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in support of that which would bring destruction to all.
