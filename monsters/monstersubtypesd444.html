Manasaputras are lawful good spirits ascending to a new stage of existence on the Positive Energy Plane. They have the following traits. <ul><li>Darkvision 60 ft. </li><li>Immunity to calling magic, disease, and poison. </li><li>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells. This does not stack with the <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">still mind monk class feature</a> and counts as that feature for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites. </li><li>Telepathy. </li><li>Manasaputras do not breathe. </li><li>Adaptive Resistance (Su): Many manasaputras have the ability to adapt to elemental attacks quickly. Anytime a manasaputra is damaged by an elemental attack, it gains the adaptive resistance listed against that element for a number of rounds equal to its Wisdom modifier.
&emsp;Format: adaptive 10; Location: Resist. </li><li>Formless (Su): Most manasaputras are not defined by physical form, and choose to adopt a corporeal form at their leisure. Manasaputras with this ability can transition between corporeal and incorporeal forms as a move action. When a manasaputra becomes corporeal, it retains its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to AC. A manasaputra's natural attacks, unarmed strikes, and manufactured weapon attacks are only available while the manasaputra is in its corporeal form, with the exception of <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> weapons. </li><li>Positive Energy Affinity (Ex): Manasaputras can exist comfortably on the Positive Energy Plane, and do not benefit (or suffer) from that plane's overwhelming infusions of life-giving energies. Whenever a manasaputra is subjected to a magical healing effect, that effect functions at its full potential, as if enhanced by the <a href="featdisplaya403.html?ItemName=Maximize%20Spell">Maximize Spell</a> feat. </li><li>Soul Armor (Ex): Manasaputras add their Wisdom bonus to their AC and CMD. In addition, manasaputras gain a +1 bonus to their AC and CMD for every 4 racial HD they possess. These bonuses work as per the <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">AC bonus monk class ability</a>, and monk levels stack with racial HD to determine the additional benefits. </li><li>Subjective Appearance (Su): When in corporeal form, a manasaputra projects a psychic illusion over its body, masking its true appearance. Any creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that views a manasaputra sees it as an idealized human form, though often with unusual features. Creatures physically interacting with a manasaputra can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the manasaputra's HD + the manasaputra's Charisma modifier) to disbelieve the illusion. If successful, the character sees the corporeal veil as a translucent outline, with the fiery body of the manasaputra contained within. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.</li></ul>
