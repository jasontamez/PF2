Tactics

Before Combat The gnoll casts countless eyes and mage armor on herself.
During Combat The bouda's favorite tactic is to use a spell such as cloudkill or waves of fatigue against multiple enemies to soften them up before her packmates attack. She then singles out enemies for slay living or baleful polymorph.
Base Statistics Without countless eyes and mage armor, the gnoll's statistics are Senses no all-around vision; AC 15, touch 12, flat-footed 14.

Description

Though she sees after the pack, a bouda is an unknowable and cryptic being even to gnolls who grew up with her, for arcane magic remains largely a mystery to gnolls, and most avoid it. Because a bouda's expertise seems so alien and odd, a witch must prove her toughness before she is accepted as a revered bouda.
