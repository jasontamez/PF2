Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) A zephyr's breath weapon is a thunderous blast of wind. Creatures in the area of the breath weapon take 6d6 points of electricity damage and are affected as by a windstorm (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439). Creatures that successfully save against this effect take half damage and avoid the effects of the wind. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Change Shape (Su) A zephyr can shift between its equine shape and that of a unique Large, winged humanoid as a standard action. When a zephyr is in humanoid form, its land speed becomes 40 feet, and its fly speed remains unchanged. Its hoof and bite attacks are replaced with two slam attacks that deal 1d8+7 points of damage plus 2d6 points of sonic damage, and its reach increases to 10 feet. It can use all of its other abilities in this form. A zephyr doesn't revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are considered its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.

Powerful Hooves (Ex) A zephyr's hooves are primary attacks.

Thundering Blows (Su) A zephyr's natural weapons (including its trample attack), as well as any bludgeoning weapons it wields, deal an additional 2d6 points of electricity damage.

Wind Resistance (Ex) A zephyr is treated as if it were two size categories larger for the purposes of determining the effects high winds have upon it.

Wind Senses (Su) A zephyr's vision is not obstructed by fog, mist, weather conditions, or wind-blown particles. This includes magical effects as well as natural effects.

Description

Zephyrs are nature spirits tied to the weather. Some more social zephyrs enjoy cavorting with athletic mortals, but their wanderlust means that their good graces last at most a matter of months before they vanish for at least as long, seeking new horizons and racing storms. Zephyrs are seen by some as minor divinities of weather or as servants of Gozreh or the Eldest.

When attacked or provoked into aggression by a perceived offense, a zephyr uses its breath weapon to scatter foes and then takes advantage of its mobility to trample or pounce on whichever enemy seems most isolated or physically imposing. A zephyr uses its spelllike abilities to prevent foes from regrouping. True to its proud fey nature, a zephyr rarely admits defeat without planning to turn the weather against an adversary at a later time as part of a vengeful ambush.

A zephyr in its equine form is the size of a large horse and weighs over 1,000 pounds. A zephyr in its humanoid form usually stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs around 400 pounds, possessing an athletic build with feathered wings spanning 15 feet.

Ecology

Zephyrs are spirits of the sky and storm who sometimes slip through from the First World in places where long-lasting weather patterns scour the land. These fey reproduce sexually, but require a strong thunderstorm or another extremely high-energy system for successful conception. Zephyrs are known to have brief dalliances with mortals, a fact that has made them possible ancestors of humanoid sorcerers and bloodragers with the fey or stormborn bloodlines. Amorous zephyrs usually test potential paramours with challenges of physical skill and endurance such as races or wrestling matches. Because they draw nourishment from the places where warm and cool air mix, zephyrs travel seasonally, always dashing after these roiling weather systems. These fey can live for thousands of years, wasting away only when they are imprisoned for decades or when the climate around them has shifted to become unrecognizable or stagnant.

Habitat and Society

Zephyrs roam across the world to anywhere they can see the sky, but these free-spirited fey favor windswept plains, deserts, lonely mountain peaks, and stormy coastlines. These creatures have been spotted all along the Inner Sea's shores, and they appear to be plentiful near the Eye of Abendego. High stone ruins near vital trade routes or sensitive farmlands feature reliefs and sculptures depicting both bounty and misery brought by a zephyr's tempestuous idea of fun. Many settlements throughout Cheliax and other longstanding civilizations once left offerings to zephyrs in places such as these a few times a year in order to reduce the risk of troublesome storms. Such offerings might include hyacinths or other eyecatching flowers, fragrant fruits, charred meat, jewels, and works of art celebrating the beauty and strength of horses, humans, and storms. Though not a common event in current times, these donations are still arranged by sailors, farmers, travelers, and worshipers of Gozreh or the Eldest.

While some zephyrs do serve the deities of weather, nature, and storms, other zephyrs regard such deities simply as powerful spiritual peers. Those zephyrs worshiped in their own right by mortals usually turn an eye on their faithful at most once or twice a year, whether out of pleasure or offense. A source of deep insult to a fickle zephyr might easily seem innocuous to mortals and could include damaging flowers that the zephyr favors, erecting tall structures (especially windmills), or any magical manipulation of the air or weather.

Other Zephyrs

In addition to the relatively common breed of zephyr presented above, sometimes called a thunderstorm zephyr, there exist others with slightly different abilities and behaviors.

Blizzard Zephyr (CR 12): Blizzard zephyrs dwell in cold climes, although they often follow their namesake storms south on wintry winds. A blizzard zephyr's breath weapon is a 90-foot cone that deals cold damage as it blasts its enemies with snow and ice that knock enemies prone instead of blowing them back. A blizzard zephyr has immunity to cold rather than immunity to electricity, and has electricity resistance 10. It can use polar ray once per day and diminish plants three times per day instead of chain lightning and plant growth.

Sirocco Zephyr (CR 12): Sirocco zephyrs come into the world in places such as northern Garund and the Cinderlands of Varisia that are rife with hot, dry winds; sandstorms; and volcanic eruptions. A sirocco zephyr's breath weapon is a 90-foot cone that deals slashing damage and blinds enemies for 1d4 rounds instead of blowing them back. A sirocco zephyr has immunity to fire rather than immunity to electricity, and has electricity resistance 10. It can use diminish plants three times per day and sirocco (DC 21) once per day instead of chain lightning and plant growth.

Whirlwind Zephyr (CR 13): Whirlwind zephyrs are the rarest of their kind, born from magical storms and tornadoes found almost exclusively on temperate plains or on hurricane-wracked coasts such as those around the Eye of Abendego. These zephyrs have the advanced creature simple template. A whirlwind zephyr also gains the whirlwind universal monster ability (1/day, 10-60 feet high, 2d6+7 damage plus 2d6 sonic, DC 25) and can use ice storm once per day instead of fog cloud and plant growth.
