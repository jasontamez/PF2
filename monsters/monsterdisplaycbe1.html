Special Abilities

Ramming Snout (Ex) When a kaprosuchus charges, it can ram
an opponent with the calcified tip of its snout. This attack
has the same attack bonus as the kaprosuchus's bite attack,
and it deals an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the
kaprosuchus's bite damage. If the attack is successful, the
kaprosuchus can attempt
a trip combat maneuver
against the target as a
free action.

Description

Despite its close
resemblance to other
types of crocodilians,
the kaprosuchus is a
terrestrial predator, not an
aquatic one. Squat and
powerfully built, these
creatures hunt for
prey in forests.
The adults can
grow up to 20
feet long and
weigh as much as
2,500 pounds.
