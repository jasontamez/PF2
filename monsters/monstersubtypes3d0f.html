Qlippoth are chaotic evil outsiders from the deepest reaches of the Abyss. They have the following traits unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry. <ul><li>Immunity to cold, mind-affecting effects, and poison. </li><li>Resistance to acid 10, electricity 10, and fire 10. </li><li>Horrific Appearance (Su): All qlippoth have such horrific and mind-rending shapes. A qlippoth can present itself as a standard action to assault the senses of all living creatures within 30 feet. The exact effects caused by a qlippoth's horrific appearance vary by the type of qlippoth. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the qlippoth's Hit Dice + the qlippoth's Charisma modifier) reduces or negates the effect. This ability is a mind-affecting gaze attack. </li><li>Telepathy. </li><li>Except where otherwise noted, qlippoth speak Abyssal.</li></ul>
