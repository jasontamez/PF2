Trench Mist

A noxious mustard-colored vapor hangs low over the battlefield,
concealing the lurching forms of dead soldiers.

Special Abilities

Create Juju Zombie (Su) A trench mist can animate
any corporeal creature that is slain while
engulfed within the mist's form. The victim
rises as a juju zombie in 1d4 rounds, and is
under the control of the trench mist
that created it. A juju zombie becomes
free-willed if it is separated from
its parent trench mist. A trench
mist can animate and control
a number of juju zombies
whose Hit Die total does not
exceed twice the trench
mist's own Hit Dice.
Any additional juju
zombies beyond
that become
free-willed.

Engulfing Mists (Ex) A trench mist can engulf foes. A creature engulfed
by a trench mist does not gain the pinned condition and
can move normally-such a creature is not in danger of
suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it
takes the trench mist's touch damage. A trench mist's vapors
obscure sight as per the spell obscuring mist. The save DC to
avoid the engulfing mists is Constitution-based.

Gaseous (Ex) A trench mist has a body composed of vapor. This
form grants it the amorphous defensive ability and allows
it to pass through small holes or even mere cracks with
no reduction to its speed, but it can't enter water or other
liquids. A trench mist doesn't have a Strength score. It can't
manipulate or wear objects, and it is treated as a creature
three size categories smaller than its actual size (Medium for
most trench mists) for the purpose of how wind affects it.

Juju Zombie Symbiosis (Su) Because of its symbiotic
relationship with the juju zombies it creates, a trench mist
shares its senses with its animated zombies as long as they
are engulfed within its form, granting them lifesense and
making them immune to the concealment the trench mist
imposes upon creatures within and outside of its foggy form.

Description

Trench mists arise from the wholesale slaughter of troops
with spells such as acid fog and cloudkill. These magical
mists linger over the battlefield, absorbing the departing
souls and mental anguish of the slain, and developing
a supernatural, malevolent sentience. Once born, trench
mists seek only to impart misery and inflict a choking,
scalding fate on those fortunate
enough to escape the attacks
that birthed the creature in the
first place.

As it preys upon the living, a trench
mist bleeds its bitter impulses into
those it kills, adding the afflicted
to a growing horde of shambling
servants. Victims of its acidic
mist rise as hateful zombies under
the creature's control, and a trench
mist that gains a horde of zombies is a
dangerous foe indeed. On battlefields
where trench mists are known to
have arisen, wise commanders
arrange cease-fires during which
both sides abandon the site after
gaseous attacks, lest their troops
succumb to the horrifying fate
of their comrades.

A trench mist's billowing
form extends 20 feet across,
but if bottled, weighs
less than a pound.
