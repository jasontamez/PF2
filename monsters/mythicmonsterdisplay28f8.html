Description

The ambitious Gnargorak always hungered for power and status, but he didn't aspire to be Jarl of all Jarls until Winter's Heart came into his grasp. The sword whispered dreams of greatness to Gnargorak, of lordship over all frost giants. The first obstacle to establishing his regime was the ancient silver dragon Lanargix, long a thorn in the side of frost giants throughout the Tusk Mountains. Jarl Gnargorak filled her hide with a dozen arrows before meeting her in melee, sword to claw. With the dead dragon's horns adorning his staff, Gnargorak proclaimed himself the chosen of Thremyr and high jarl of all frost giants, in the Tusk Mountains and beyond. Now, a full score of Tusk Mountain jarls openly swear fealty to Gnargorak. Others placate him, lest they draw his wrath. Only the jarl's lack of focus and unceasing need to conquer keeps him from uniting the remaining giants of the Tusks under one banner.

The skulls of those who dared dispute his sovereignty line the path to his mountain fortress of Bos-Phargrumm (see page 33). He rarely sets foot in this ice castle, as raiding the hated Mammoth Lords brings him far more pleasure than consolidating his rule. The towering citadel that reaches into the clouds stays busy even without its ostensible owner sitting upon its massive, ornate throne. Jarl Gnargorak's cloud giant harem lives there, serving as his advisors, maintaining the treasuries, collecting taxes from lands Gnargorak has claimed, and negotiating with the tribes on the jarl's behalf. They grow tired of this work, as the jarl is far more interested in conquering new territory than in ruling over that which he holds.

Winter's Heart also grows weary of Gnargorak's lack of dedication to building a true empire. Of late, the sword has denied the jarl its greater powers except in times of dire need. It constantly searches for another potential leader to bear it and use it to impose rule over the north. Of course, the jarl never lets Winter's Heart leave his presence, so the sword's options are limited. The artifact is unattended only while the jarl is in his personal chambers, where he feels he's safe. But one of his harem has communicated with the sword and sympathizes with its goals. She watches for the best candidates, and invites them to Bos-Phargrumm on false pretenses so she can weigh their acumen. She and Winter's Heart haven't found a suitable leader among the frost giants; there's no shortage of ambition among their kind, but no tribal leader has half the experience or cunning Gnargorak does.

Though other frost giants admire and fear Jarl Gnargorak's prowess in battle, they view his harem of cloud giants with private derision and a touch of envy. Even given the jarl's imposing 16-foot stature, his brides all stand noticeably taller than he. Gnargorak prizes his exotic harem, and eagerly anticipates the birth of a son surely destined to be the mightiest frost giant in all the Tusks. Yet despite his many brides, the jarl's seed has yet to bear fruit. His displeasure over this continued lack of an heir drives him to ever more brutal raids against the Mammoth Lords so that he can at least leave a legacy of conquest and make a mark for all to see in the histories of the north-even if there would be no one of his own blood to take over his domain.

Jarl Gnargorak leads a veritable army, but because he started out as a hunter, not a soldier, he uses his forces in unconventional ways that suit the tactics he learned in the wild. Rather than simply leading an overwhelming force directly into battle against the Mammoth Lords, he draws the warriors' attention away from the safety of their followings and into his snares and ambushes. Only when a group is weakened does he sweep in to destroy them.
