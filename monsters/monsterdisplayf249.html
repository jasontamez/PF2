Special Abilities

Deep Dweller (Ex) Deep
merfolk are immune
to damage from water
pressure; their bodies
adjust instantly to different
depths.
Semitransparent (Ex) Deep merfolk
are very difficult to spot while they are
underwater. So long as they are at least
10 feet underwater, deep merfolk gain
concealment and can use the Stealth skill while
moving at their normal speed without penalty.
In the ocean depths (about 3,000 feet deep or
more), this benefit improves to total concealment.
Sprint (Ex) A deep merfolk can charge or withdraw
at up to 3 times its swim speed.

Description

Much like common merfolk, deep merfolk have
humanoid upper bodies and fish-like tails, but they
are adapted for survival within the depths of the ocean.
Their skin is both dark and transparent to help them blend
with the sunless ocean depths. They sometimes adorn
themselves with bioluminescent dye to create glowing spots
on the skin along their tails, which they use both as a form
of silent communication and to lure in prey when they hunt.

Deep merfolk build villages along the sides of the deepest
ocean trenches, where they hunt sea creatures and gather
crustaceans from the ocean floor. They are capable hunters,
and small hunting groups of deep merfolk have been
known to take down sharks or other large creatures stalking
the depths. When hunting, deep merfolk prefer to ambush
their prey, often luring targets in with bioluminescence.
They rely on their camouf lage to hide within the crevices
and cold sand until their traps can be sprung.

Like their cousins, deep merfolk are highly protective
of their tribes and homes and go to great lengths to
keep strangers away. Spellcasters among their
tribes often use illusions to hide deep merfolk
dwellings, while rangers and hunters set up
traps, ambushes, and false trails that lead
interlopers into distant and dangerous areas
of the deep ocean. If such misdirection and
illusion fail, deep merfolk don't hesitate
to launch proactive attacks against
intruders-at a fair distance away
from their homes if possible.

While their appearance has led
to legends of ties to dark powers
and sinister agendas, most deep
merfolk are simple folk with
little interest in the world above
the waves. A few secretive tribes
worship the demon lord Dagon,
but they view him as a dark
protector they must appease,
not a deity to emulate or
for whom they feel
any affection.
