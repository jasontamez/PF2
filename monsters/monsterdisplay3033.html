Harridan - Monsters







Harridan

This massive beast is a beautiful giantess from the waist up and a vicious hunting cat from the waist down. Somehow, the look of abject cruelty in her eyes is more unsettling than the feral claws of her lower half.

Description

Harridans are manipulators and slave takers, the spiritual leaders of the lamyros race's dark faith. Megalomaniacal and corrupt, these giant lamias obsess over control, seeking to bend all they encounter to their will through lies and subtlety, brute force, or magic. Fewer in number than even the rare lamia matriarchs (see Pathfinder #2), harridans are the cunning masterminds of their race and all other lamias rightly fear and obey these powerful and cruel despots.

A harridan is a massive creature with the torso of a gigantic female humanoid sprouting from the body of a 20-foot-long dire lion. Her fur is darker than that of a normal dire lion, making it easier for her to blend in with the rocks of the mountains and deserts where harridans reside, and her upper body is hairless save for a luxurious mane of thick hair growing from her scalp. Harridans often weigh upwards of 6,000 pounds and can live to be more than 500 years old.
