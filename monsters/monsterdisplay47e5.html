Description

When a Kalistocrat performs the final rites to create her idealized afterlife, the likelihood of success depends on how stringently she adhered to Kalistrade's teachings and how much wealth she sacrificed to serve as an occult anchor for her will. It's not always apparent which prophets succeed, and mere weeks after death, the mindscapes of those prophets who failed begin to collapse. For most, their souls become untethered and join the River of Souls, but others cling tenaciously to their failed dream, and their consciousness escapes into and animates their gold-veined bodies.

Some of these so-called failed prophets eventually slip out of their shells and accept <a href="deitydisplaybf7b.html?ItemName=Pharasma">Pharasma's</a> judgment. Others refuse to accept their own failure and attempt to perform the ritual again after accumulating far more wealth than before. These failed prophets often break out of their mausoleums to hunt down the wealthy and steal their treasure-or worse, dismantle the precious bodies of other Kalistocrats for scrap, sending the mindscapes of their onetime allies hurtling to the Astral Plane to be torn apart by predators or astral weather.

Creating a Failed Prophet

"Failed prophet" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice. A failed prophet retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: The base creature's CR + 2.

Type: The creature's type changes to construct with the augmented subtype. The failed prophet retains all subtypes except alignment subtypes (such as good). Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.

Senses: A failed prophet gains darkvision 60 feet as well the following ability.

Silver Scent (Ex): A failed prophet can sense valuable materials as if using the <a href="umr6bd3.html?ItemName=Scent">scent</a> universal monster rule. A failed prophet can attempt a DC 20 Appraise check as a free action to identify the relative values of detected wealth.

Armor Class: A failed prophet has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature's natural armor bonus, whichever is better.

Hit Dice: Change all of the base creature's racial Hit Dice to d10s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged. As constructs, failed prophets gain bonus hit points based on their size.

Defensive Abilities: A failed prophet gains DR 10/ bludgeoning and magic, a +4 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects, and immunity to cold and electricity. The failed prophet also gains the immunities normally granted by her construct traits, except for the construct type's immunity to mind-affecting effects. Failed prophets also gain the following defensive ability.

Revel in Wealth (Ex): A failed prophet gains fast healing equal to her Hit Dice so long as she has wealth stored in her personal vault (see below) worth at least 1,000 gp. Melee Attack: A failed prophet gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn't already have them. These claws have a reach equal to the base creature's natural reach plus 5 feet and deal damage as if the prophet were one size larger than she actually is. In place of making a claw attack, a failed prophet can instead attempt a touch attack that deals no damage but allows her to use her greedy grab special attack. The failed prophet's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A failed prophet gains the following special attacks.

Aurokinesis: A failed prophet can hurl shards of her body, gaining the gather power and kinetic blast abilities of a <a href="classdisplayc359.html?ItemName=Kineticist">kineticist</a> with a level equal to the prophet's CR - 2. She also gains the <a href="kineticisttalentsdisplayefe2.html?ItemName=Earth%20Blast">earth blast</a> kinetic blast and a number of infusions equal to 1/3 the prophet's CR (rounded up). A failed prophet of CR 10 or higher also gains the <a href="kineticisttalentsdisplay1303.html?ItemName=Metal%20Blast">metal blast</a> composite blast. If a failed prophet already has the kinetic blast class ability, she can instead either gain the internal buffer class ability of a kineticist whose level is equal to the prophet's CR or increase the number of points her internal buffer can store by 2; in either case, she restores her buffer to its maximum capacity every 24 hours.

For the purpose of calculating the save DCs and damage for her kineticist abilities, the prophet chooses either her Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score and uses that in place of her Constitution score. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed.

Greedy Grab (Ex): When a failed prophet hits a creature with her claw attack or a touch attack, she can attempt a free stealAPG combat maneuver with a +4 racial bonus to steal the target's wealth; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If successful, the prophet grabs mundane valuables from the target equal to 100 gp ?? the failed prophet's Hit Dice, shoveling them into her personal vault (see below). A failed prophet cannot steal more wealth than her target has.

Personal Vault (Ex): A failed prophet can stow small objects and mundane valuables within her body, up to 500 gp ?? her Hit Dice. Creatures can steal individual objects from this extradimensional space with a successful steal combat maneuver or Sleight of Hand check, though either of these checks takes a -5 penalty.

Plutophage (Ex): A failed prophet can siphon the value from the valuables in her personal vault equal to 100 gp ?? her Hit Dice to negate 1 point of burn whenever she would accept burn from her aurokinesis. Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +2, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2. A failed prophet has no Constitution score. Skills: Failed prophets have a +4 racial bonus on Appraise, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A failed prophet's skills are the same as those of the base creature, except she treats Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (religion) as class skills as well.
