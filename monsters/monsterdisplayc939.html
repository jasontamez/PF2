Mummy Lord

Dirty linen strips swathe this emaciated, once-noble figure from
head to toe. Its eyes burn with unholy light.

Description

Many cultures practice the sacred art of mummification,
though the sinister magical techniques used to imbue
corpses with undead vitality are far less widespread. In
certain ancient lands, such blasphemous techniques
have been ref ined through centuries of ceremony and
countless deaths, giving rise to mummies of terrible
power. On rare occasions, if the deceased was of great
rank and exceeding malevolence, he might undergo
such elaborate rituals, rising from his tomb as a fearful
mummy lord. Similarly, a ruler known for his malice or
who died in a moment of great rage might spontaneously
arise as such a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact
circumstances of his resurrection, a mummy lord
retains the abilities he had in life, becoming a creature
consumed by the desire to restore his rule and dominate
both the living and dead.
