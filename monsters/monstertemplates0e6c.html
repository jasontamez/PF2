A creature with the colour-blighted simple template appears hideously deformed and glows with the same unnamable color as the creature that blighted it. A colour-blighted creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: A colour-blighted creature's ability scores suffer drain as a result of being fed upon by a colour out of space, but once a creature gains this template, it becomes immune to further feed attacks from colours out of space until it loses the colour-blighted simple template. A Charisma score drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack is raised to 1; other ability scores are not altered. In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one need only restore all of its drained ability scores to normal. As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes strangely aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets. Every 24 hours, a creature suffering from this simple template must make a DC 12 Fortitude save to resist crumbling into fine white ash'such a doom means instant death and, for many color-blighted creatures, their only chance at escape from a life filled with pain.
