Special Abilities

Controlled Swarm (Ex) A mote archon swarm can choose not to deal swarm damage to any creature sharing its space and can choose not to impede the spellcasting or concentration of a creature sharing its space.

Superlative Healer (Su) A mote archon swarm can use the Heal skill to provide first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison as a swift action; to treat a disease as a move action; and to treat a deadly wound as a full-round action. Creatures to be treated must share the mote archon swarm's space, but the mote archon swarm can treat any number of creatures within its space with the same action. A mote archon swarm does not require a healer's kit to treat deadly wounds.

Vibrating Combustion (Ex) As a swift action, a mote archon swarm can vibrate rapidly for 1 round, heating the air and dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 26 half) in addition to swarm damage at the end of its turn. Creatures that begin their turns in the swarm's area risk catching on fire (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). A creature that succeeds at its save against this ability is immune to catching on fire at the start of its next turn. A burning creature can't attempt to extinguish itself as long as it is in the mote archon swarm's space. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Mote archons are tiny, floating runes less than an inch across. Individually, they are benign and nearly mindless creatures, but mote archons are virtually never found alone, congregating naturally in groups of hundreds or thousands of their kind. Together, these swarms of mote archons have a unified personality and an overwhelming drive to comfort the sick and heal the injured. They are most often found on the battlefields of Heaven tending to injured angels and other archons, and never hesitating to defend creatures under their care. Angry mote archons oscillate rapidly until they ignite and swarm over enemies with fiery retribution.

A mote archon swarm has no appreciable weight.

Ecology

Mote archon swarms are sparkling heralds of comfort and succor. Each mote archon within a swarm is a tiny, virtually mindless creature as light as dandelion fluff. A mote archon has the form of a spherical rune with sharp edges. No two mote archons seem to have the same shape, but because the tiny creatures glow brightly, their exact form is difficult to discern. Their glow is a white light the strength of a candle flame; unlike lantern archons, mote archons cannot change the strength or color of their glow.

Mote archons naturally gravitate to the nearest of their kind, floating erratically over or around obstacles as they move toward each other. When clustered in swarms of a few hundred individuals, they develop a hive mind and a distinct personality. This personality is as mutable as the swarm itself; a mote archon swarm that loses a few dozen members might become grim or despondent, while a swarm that gains more members becomes cheerful. As mote archon swarms speak little, these differences in temperament often manifest through the lethargy or agitation of individual lights within the swarm. Regardless of their current personalities, mote archon swarms remain driven to help the sick or injured and cannot stand idle in the face of suffering.

Although they are creatures of healing, mote archon swarms are easily angered. The surest method to anger a mote archon swarm is to threaten harm to any creatures it deems under its care. A mote archon swarm is also enraged by acts of senseless butchery or wanton violence. When roused to anger, a mote archon swarm descends upon its enemies with righteous fervor. As each mote archon has sharp edges, a darting swarm of the creatures can shred skin; however, the swarm has sufficient control over its component motes for it to flay enemies but leave allies unharmed. When infuriated, the individual components of the swarm oscillate rapidly until their rage ignites them.

Habitat and Society

Mote archon swarms are rarely found outside of Heaven, where they tend to injured angels and archons in the wide pavilions that celestials use as hospitals. Celestial armies commission mote archon swarms as field medics, and the glittering swarms accompany the Heavenly forces in their wars against the legions of evil. In these great clashes, mote archon swarms dart about the battlefield, attacking foes while healing allies. A mote archon swarm's desire to heal sometimes overcomes its better judgment, however, and it might staunch an enemy's mortal wound or target a desperately injured enemy along with its allies when it uses its mass cure light wounds ability. Mote archon swarms see this not as an error, but as a measure of grace that lowers the aggregate amount of suffering in the universe.

Mote archons are generated as a celestial byproduct during the ascension of an archon into a more powerful form. An archon who has served Heaven as a warrior or crusader produces few or no motes, whereas a diplomat or peacemaker might produce as many as a dozen, and an archon dedicated to easing suffering and healing the sick might engender dozens of motes each time it ascends to a higher form. The motes thus produced are mindless, inclined to do no more than seek out others of their kind and avoid causing harm. (A mote caught between these two directives'such as a mote cupped in clasped hands that could escape only by slicing free with its sharp edges'simply oscillates in place until a resolution presents itself.) Only when motes gather in large numbers does a personality appear, but this is independent of the personalities of the archons who shed the component motes.

Mote archon swarms tend to act more spontaneously than other archons. When creatures under their care have recovered sufficiently, mote archon swarms abandon the immediate area, giving in to wanderlust. Mote archon swarms encountered outside of Heaven have usually slipped through a portal or gateway in such meanderings. Although these itinerant swarms find healing work to occupy their time, they eventually pine for the familiar fields of Heaven.

Mote archon swarms enjoy the company of other celestials dedicated to healing. They particularly admire brijidines and sometimes follow these fiery azatas with exuberant devotion. Eventually, a mote archon swarm's adoration gives way to irritation over an azata's flighty recklessness, however, so the swarm returns to the more serious business of tending to the sick or wounded.
