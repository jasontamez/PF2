Special Abilities

Champion Armor (Ex) A dark champion's speed is not reduced for wearing armor.

Death Throes (Su) A slain dark champion combusts in an explosive flash that destroys its armor but not its other gear. All creatures within a 10-foot radius burst take 3d6 points of fire damage and an additional 2d6 points of piercing damage (Reflex DC 17 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Fighter Training (Ex) Dark champions are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor and shields. They have a base attack bonus equal to their Hit Dice and can select combat feats that have fighter levels as a prerequisite, treating their Hit Dice as their fighter level for that purpose.

Description

The rare dark folk children born without eyes are assigned to the dark champion caste and begin a life of rigor, privation, and martial training. Their armor is typically bolted to their bodies in sections and removed only rarely. Most other dark folk appreciate the discipline and might of dark champions, but they treat them with wary respect.
