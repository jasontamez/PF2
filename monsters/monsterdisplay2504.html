Occulari - Monsters







Occulari

Bundles of viscera hang from the hundreds of levitating eyes in this mass. Jagged teeth protrude from each eyelid, forming makeshift fanged maws.

Special Abilities

Capitulating Gaze (Su) Creatures within 30 feet that meet the occulari's gaze are lulled into a complacent stupor and cannot move, as if affected by hold monster (Will DC 18 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Eye Possession (Su) An occulari that begins its turn in a space occupied by a creature paralyzed by its capitulating gaze attack may spend a full-round action to burrow tendrils into the victim's eyes, plucking them out and blinding the creature; a successful DC 18 Fortitude saving throw resists this attempt. As a standard action, an occulari can insert two of its own eyes into a blinded victim that shares its space (Fortitude DC 18 negates). On a failed save, the victim is cured of its blindness and gains darkvision 60 feet, but the occulari can see through its victim's new eyes at will. An occulari may also cloud the sight of any eye possession victims at will, granting it total concealment against any creature whose eyes it has replaced. A remove disease spell removes the parasitic eyes, rendering the creature blind, while a regenerate spell removes the occulari implants and restores a creature's vision. If the occulari is killed, any victims of its eye possession are blinded. The saving throw DCs are Constitution-based.

Multigaze (Su) As a standard action, an occulari can actively gaze at up to 3 creatures within 30 feet.

Unavoidable Gaze (Su) Sighted creatures in an occulari's space cannot avert their eyes to avoid the occulari's gaze attack, and take a -4 penalty on saving throws against the gaze attack.

Description

Occularis are amalgams of grotesquely mutated eyes. Motivated by their desire to see all things, they hunt down hosts for their component parts and use them to experience the wider world. Many covet the sights that the aboveground world offers, while others work as spies for intellect devourers, who provide these hideous swarms with a sense of purpose and ample prey.
