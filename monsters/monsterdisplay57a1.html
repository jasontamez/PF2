Special Abilities

Argent Prince (Su) In his true form, Mammon lacks a body. The archdevil relies entirely on his possession spell-like abilities to interact with the physical world. In his true form, Mammon gains the incorporeal quality, gains a deflection bonus to his AC equal to his Charisma modifier (+11), and replaces his base speed of 50 feet with a fly speed of 80 feet (perfect maneuverability); he loses all abilities that rely on a physical body (including his Strength score, the additional immunities gained from possessing the Argent Prince (see below), air walk, his natural armor bonus, and his natural attacks).

Mammon rarely interacts with others without possessing a body, and his favorite body to possess is that of the Argent Prince-a powerful unique construct that represents the archdevil's ideal form. The Argent Prince always fails its saving throw against Mammon's greater object possession spell-like ability, and Mammon can call the Argent Prince to his side across any distance (even across planar boundaries) as a swift action-when he does so, he can possess the Argent Prince immediately. While possessing the Argent Prince, Mammon gains air walk as a constant spell-like ability; the gleaming glory ability (see below); and immunity to bleed, disease, necromancy effects, paralysis, sleep effects, and stunning. When Mammon is not possessing the Argent Prince (typically because he is possessing another object or being), the Argent Prince loses all of its spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities, but remains under the control of Mammon and can continue to fight or take other actions as Mammon directs. If the Argent Prince is destroyed, Mammon can rebuild it, but doing so requires the archdevil to remain sequestered in his workshop deep in Erebus for a year.

Gleaming Glory (Ex) The Argent Prince's gleaming metallic body reflects light and magic. In bright light, a creature within 60 feet is automatically dazzled, while one that moves or begins its turn within 10 feet is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 37 Fortitude save or averts or closes its eyes as for a gaze attack. Rays and magical ranged touch attacks have a 20% miss chance against the Argent Prince, and such missed attacks have a 20% chance of being redirected toward a random target within 60 feet; otherwise, they are deflected harmlessly. While possessed by Mammon, the Argent Prince increases both chances to 50%, and if the creator of an effect deflected by this ability is within 60 feet, Mammon can reflect it at that creature instead of choosing randomly. Gaze attacks and light-based effects (including color spray and prismatic spray) targeting Mammon have the same chance as rays of being reflected, while area effects of this nature simply do not affect him. Mammon also has the same chance to move without harm through a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Mammon's Mark (Su) Any coin, gemstone, piece of jewelry, or art object that Mammon touches bears his invisible image for 13 days. He can sense the location of marked items (as per locate object, even if such an object is in an extradimensional space), and can communicate through them as per enter image. In both cases, this effect has 10 times the normal range (or unlimited range within Mammon's domain on Erebus). If a creature has a marked object in its possession for 24 hours, Mammon can locate that creature (as per locate creature with the same increase to range as above) at will as a free action, even if the marked object is discarded. Mammon gains a +10 bonus on caster level checks and to the save DC of scrying effects he uses against such creatures. If the creature is protected by an effect that protects against scrying and Mammon is in Erebus, the archdevil can expend one use of his mythic power to ignore that effect. This is a curse effect.

Plunderer (Su) Mammon can sense wealth within 300 feet as if using a rod of metal and mineral detection. He also gains a +10 bonus on Appraise checks and on Spellcraft checks to identify the magical properties of items, can attempt either check once per round as a free action to determine the value or properties of any item within his line of sight, and gains a +10 bonus until the end of his turn on combat maneuver checks to disarm a creature of or steal an item he has thus appraised or identified.

Description

Mammon is the master of avarice, a fallen angel long in service to Asmodeus; though slain by his enemies long ago, his spirit lingered in his hellish sepulcher, unwilling to surrender to oblivion. His hunger for life infused his spirit into the obscene wealth heaped about him in death, until he became one with the wealth of ages. The Grasping One is now vault keeper for all of Hell, growing ever more resplendent as he discovers new treasures to incorporate into his form and reporting directly to Asmodeus on Hell's accounts.

Mammon can possess objects and creatures with ease, but most often possesses the Argent Prince, a peerlessly sculpted 8-foot-tall metallic likeness of his former angelic glory, tastefully tainted with accents of his diabolic nature.

Mammon's Cult

Mammon is the patron saint of greed, and is worshiped
by unscrupulous merchants and rapacious robber barons.
His sacred places are often in mansions, museums, and
palaces of obscene opulence. Some give offerings to him in
secret, while others shamelessly praise his name and the
power of greed to all who are willing to listen-and even
some who are not.

Mammon's unholy symbol is a midnight blue coin
with a horned devil's head and an infernal inscription of
his name in pale silvery blue. His favored weapon is the
shortspear. He grants access to the Artifice, Earth, Evil, and
Law domains, and to the Construct, Devil, Metal,
and Toil subdomains.

The greatest and most terrible of devils are the archdevils of Hell, powerful scions of law and evil, subtle and sophisticated demigods who each rule one of the eight vast planes of torment that form the layers of Hell. Each archdevil is a unique creature, and each fits into a specific role in the cosmic chain of corruption and oppression that devils use to bind the cosmos to their will. The first archdevils rose to power soon after their lord Asmodeus claimed Hell as his realm. Asmodeus has guided the rise of other archdevils, sometimes directly creating them as he did Belial and Mephistopheles. Others are older beings who pledged their allegiance to Asmodeus during heavenly rebellions, like Baalzebul and Dispater. Asmodeus has even been known, when in need of additional loyal viceroys, to grant archdevildom to creatures outside the diabolic race, as in the case of ascended mysteries like Barbatos and Geryon.

Below the ranks of true archdevils are Hell's infernal dukes. These infernal nobles have the potential for power equal to some of the archdevils, but without a layer of Hell under their rule, they cannot truly be counted the equal of an archdevil. An infernal duke can rise in power by gaining class levels, advancing in Hit Dice, gaining mythic ranks, undertaking a vile ritual, amassing a sufficiently large and devoted following, or, rarely, at the leave of their blasphemous lords. However, until Asmodeus sees fit to award an infernal duke its own layer of Hell (to replace a fallen archdevil or one being punished via demotion to infernal duke), such a devil is not itself an archdevil. It should be noted that as scions of law, infernal dukes and archdevils remain loyal to Asmodeus and Hell, though they might resort to trickery and subterfuge to bolster their own resources and reputations. Those who are not loyal are quickly and inevitably revealed as traitors and punished accordingly by the Prince of Darkness. There can be any number of infernal dukes in Hell, but as Asmodeus himself rules the ninth layer of Hell, only eight archdevils can exist at any one time.

An archdevil can be contacted via <a href="spelldisplaya528.html?ItemName=commune">commune</a> or <a href="spelldisplay54f1.html?ItemName=contact%20other%20plane">contact other plane</a>, and can be conjured via a <a href="spelldisplay756d.html?ItemName=gate">gate</a> spell, but when so called, an archdevil is under no compulsion to come through the gate. Typically, an archdevil requires an enormous and significant offering or sacrifice before it deigns to answer a gate spell.


The Layers of Hell

Each archdevil rules one of the eight upper layers of Hell, with infernal dukes ruling fiefdoms within it. These layers are immense in size and composed of hundreds or even thousands of smaller subdomains, each of which may be the size of a continent or as small as a strange and secret city. The environments, themes, and traits of each layer are as unique as the archdevils themselves and can shift and change in response to the mood and intention of its archdevil master. An archdevil does not exert total control over its realm, though, and powerful adventurers can infiltrate a layer and accomplish various goals without arousing the anger of its archdevil overlord-if they are careful.

An archdevil gains the following additional powers while in its realm (the statistics presented on the following pages do not include these abilities): <ul><li>Mythic: An archdevil functions as a <a href="rules0baf.html?Name=Mythic%20Monsters&amp;Category=Mythic%20Rules">10th-rank mythic creature</a>, including having the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). It can expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic versions of any spell-like ability denoted with a superscript "M," as if the ability were a mythic spell.</li> <li>Use of the following spell-like abilities at will-<a href="spelldisplayf22f.html?ItemName=demand">demand</a>, <a href="spelldisplay5dd5.html?ItemName=discern%20location">discern location</a>, <a href="spelldisplayfd7c.html?ItemName=fabricate">fabricate</a>, <a href="spelldisplay36ee.html?ItemName=major%20creation">major creation</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayd28c.html?ItemName=polymorph%20any%20object">polymorph any object</a> (when used on objects or creatures that are native to the realm, the polymorph duration factor increases by 6).</li> <li>Use of the following spell-like abilities once per day: <a href="spelldisplayf8a0.html?ItemName=binding">binding</a> and <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> (limited to physical effects that manipulate the realm or to effects that are relevant to the archdevil's area of concern).</li> <li>Heightened Awareness (Ex): An archdevil gains a +10 insight bonus on Sense Motive checks and Initiative checks.</li></ul>

Archdevils in a Campaign

Each archdevil is a unique creature ranging in power from CR 26 to CR 30. Their CRs have no impact on their standing or influence in Hell's hierarchy. Between raw power, ingenious contingencies, and legions of servants, Asmodeus's deputies share roughly similar potential for nefariousness and ruin. In any case, archdevils are generally beyond the reach of most mortal heroes, and should not be placed in an adventure without careful consideration. In most cases, they are best used as the final enemies of a long campaign-especially campaigns in which the PCs themselves are mythic characters-and even getting an audience with one should be a memorable event.

Yet while archdevils are beyond the abilities of most heroes to combat directly, they are perfect puppet masters and masterminds, inspiring and directing monsters, mortals, and entire cults at every level of a campaign. Halting a sinister ritual to unleash an archdevil on the world is a classic capstone, allowing a brief encounter with the archdevil and its minions before the ritual is halted and the archdevil forced back to Hell. Alternatively, the heroes can work to destroy an archdevil's resources, imposing increasing penalties on it and gathering potent weapons to use against it, allowing PCs to face the archdevil at a diminished CR or with negative levels (even though they are normally immune to negative levels) to represent its reduced power... until the archdevil can rebuild and recover its strength.
