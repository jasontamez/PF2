Raven Swarm - Monsters







Raven Swarm

The pitch-black birds that make up this torrent of claws and
feathers glare ominously from hundreds of beady eyes.

Special Abilities

Blindness (Ex) Raven swarms target their opponents' vulnerable faces. Whenever a creature becomes distracted by a raven swarm, it must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid being blinded for 1 round from the swarm. A raven swarm deals 2 additional points of damage to creatures it blinded in the previous round.

Description

This abnormally aggressive flock of ravens forgoes scavenging in favor of more active hunting for food. Multiple swarms of ravens make uncanny use of strategy, with one swarm flushing out prey and driving it directly into the onslaught of an allied swarm. The statistics for a raven swarm can also be used to represent any large, aggressive flock of flying birds.
