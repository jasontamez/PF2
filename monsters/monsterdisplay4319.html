Description

Ogre spiders are brutal, terrifying hunters that spin tangled webs capable of encasing entire trees. So-named because the arrangement of its eyes and mandibles gives it a face unnervingly similar to that of an ogre as much as for their size, ogre spiders can fit into nooks and tunnels far more narrow than one might expect.
