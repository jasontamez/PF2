Special Abilities

Aura of Resplendence (Sp) A chicome constantly radiates an aura of <a href="spelldisplay0b35.html?ItemName=plant%20growth">plant growth</a>, as the spell, providing enrichment to plants within a half-mile radius. The chicome can suppress or resume the aura as a free action.

Natural Form (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, a chicome can take the form of any animal, dragon, magical beast, or vermin with 18 Hit Dice or fewer. This functions as if using <a href="spelldisplaye2c7.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20IV">beast shape IV</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf518.html?ItemName=form%20of%20the%20dragon%20III">form of the dragon III</a>, <a href="spelldisplay812a.html?ItemName=magical%20beast%20shape">magical beast shape</a>, or <a href="spelldisplay0a92.html?ItemName=vermin%20shape%20II">vermin shape II</a>, as appropriate, and otherwise counts as a druid's <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">wild shape</a> ability for the purposes of abilities and prerequisites. The chicome can maintain this form indefinitely and can end the transformation as a free action.

Poison (Ex) Injury-bite; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/minute for 10 minutes; effect 2d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Spells (Sp) A chicome casts spells as an 18th-level druid, but cannot swap out prepared spells to cast summon spells.

Wild Empathy (Su) This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except the chicome has a +6 racial bonus on the check. The chicome's effective druid level is 18 for the purpose of determining its total modifier to the check.

Description

Chicomes are a powerful but gentle variety of couatl- winged serpentine outsiders who act as agents of lawful good deities-whose purpose is to reestablish nature in destroyed and ravaged lands, especially those that have been recently cleansed of evil. Chicomes accomplish this by way of powerful druidic magic and the cloud of restorative pollen and dew that constantly drifts from their wings. Like other couatls, chicomes have varicolored feathers and beautiful, glossy scales. The couatls' wing feathers are typically shades of green or brown, but their crests are always a brilliant crimson. Like for other couatls, the feathers of chicomes are incredibly powerful magic items when bestowed upon chosen mortals. Such a freely given feather can be used as the material component for a <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a> spell. In addition, if buried in at least 6 inches of soil and undisturbed for 24 hours, the feather can be used as the material component to cast a <a href="spelldisplaye3ec.html?ItemName=hallow">hallow</a> spell; the spell effect tied to the hallowed site is always the enrichment version of <a href="spelldisplay0b35.html?ItemName=plant%20growth">plant growth</a>. By using a chicome feather in this way, the caster need not expend the typical payment of gold or other valuables required by the spell.

A typical chicome is 40 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and weighs 5,500 pounds.

Ecology

Chicomes typically show themselves only in the aftermath of an incredible act of devastation or widespread destruction, such as a massive battle or the razing of a large settlement, and even then only if the couatl deems the area in question worthy of being restored. Their exact criteria for worthy lands are unclear; what is known is that badlands chosen by one of these blessed sky serpents are enormously enriched by the outsider's presence. When a chicome restores the balance of nature to a ruined area, it cleanses the land of any residual toxins and contagions, such as contaminated earth or water, and plants the seeds of new life. If the restoration of healthy biomes is not enough to draw nearby wildlife back to the region- or if all the local fauna has been exhausted-the couatl uses its magic to coax animals from other corners of the world to the fledgling environment.

Habitat and Society

Chicomes are strictly solitary creatures who dwell in the lands that need their help. While they are purifying a particular region, chicomes periodically take flight to survey the area and determine whether their presence is still justified. The couatls also scout for worthy guardians in the vicinity to take over stewardship-typically a powerful awakened animal, but sometimes a nemophilist in a nearby settlement. These individuals typically become druids who learn their abilities from the chicome, though anyone the couatl deems worthy may serve as a steward of such lands, regardless of the individual's magical prowess. Those who have received a chicome's blessing are sometimes referred to as Children of the Chicome. If ever one such steward is slain while protecting her pocket of wilderness, her host chicome will return its child to life using its powers of reincarnation. The steward is typically reborn as the animal it most identified with in life.

Though they may serve a range of lawful and good deities, chicomes are typically agents of those gods with an aspect of nature or life, such as <a href="deitydisplay8303.html?ItemName=Erastil">Erastil</a> or Cihua Couatl, or empyreal lords like <a href="deitydisplay588b.html?ItemName=Cernunnos">Cernunnos</a> or <a href="deitydisplaybc78.html?ItemName=Valani">Valani</a>. Some chicomes may even serve neutral-aligned deities such as <a href="deitydisplayc8b7.html?ItemName=Gozreh">Gozreh</a> or <a href="deitydisplay1dab.html?ItemName=Feronia">Feronia</a>. Chicomes never serve deities, no matter how noble, whose portfolio includes the destruction of nature or the spread of civilization, such as <a href="deitydisplay0003.html?ItemName=Torag">Torag</a>. Many chicomes serve no deities at all and are dedicated only to the primordial forces of nature.
