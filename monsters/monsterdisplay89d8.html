Special Abilities

Martial Proficiency (Ex) Sinspawn are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Sin-Scent (Su) Sinspawn have scent against creatures whose nature reflects the sinspawn's sin. For example, wrathful sinspawn can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular sinspawn can scent.

Sinful Bite (Su) A creature bitten by a sinspawn is overwhelmed with sinful thoughts (DC 12 Will save negates). These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes. An affected target that is bitten a second time is staggered for 1 round if it fails its saving throw. Calm emotions, remove curse, or break enchantment negates the effects of sinful bite. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Description

Sinspawn are corrupted products of magic used by spellcasters in a past era as shock troops for their armies. Literally the embodiment of a sin made flesh, they are sentient abominations of distilled ectoplasm imprinted with the soul-image of slain creatures that possessed an abundance of a particular sin.

Seven Types of Sinspawn

The above stats represent a wrathspawn, the most common type of this creature. Each type possesses unique ability modifiers, which are listed after their name.

Envyspawn (+2 Str, -2 Cha): Short and thin, envyspawn often become rangers.
Gluttonspawn (+2 Con, -2 Dex): Obese yet hardy and strong, gluttonspawn often become fighters.
Greedspawn (+2 Dex, -2 Wis): Towering over 7 feet in height, greedspawn have gold-tinged veins and often become rogues.
Lustspawn (+4 Cha, -2 Con, -2 Wis): With perfectly formed bodies sitting in grotesque counterpoint to their monstrous faces and claws, lustspawn often become sorcerers.
Pridespawn (+4 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha): Unique among sinspawn for their long manes of hair, pridespawn are near-skeletal in their gauntness. They often become wizards.
Slothspawn (+2 Wis, -2 Dex): Thick rolls of excess skin drape a slothspawn's hunched frame. They often become clerics.
Wrathspawn: These sinspawn use the statistics given above. They often become barbarians.

Advancements and Variants

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy9z14">Pathfinder #134: It Came from Hollow Mountain pg. 246</a> Each runelord experimented with sinspawn, imbuing the sinspawn with the runelord's signature sin and developing other variants. Particularly cunning sinspawn often practice martial talents, advancing as <a href="classdisplaye2cd.html?ItemName=Barbarian">barbarians</a>, <a href="classdisplay3651.html?ItemName=Fighter">fighters</a>, or <a href="classdisplay8ec3.html?ItemName=Rogue">rogues</a>. As adaptable as humanoids, sinspawn with the proper training or tutelage (perhaps originating from ancient Thassilonian texts or meditation upon the arcane energies of a runewell) might advance in any class, although sinspawn <a href="classdisplayaec9.html?ItemName=Bard">bards</a>, <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">druids</a>, and <a href="classdisplaye64c.html?ItemName=Hunter">hunters</a> are practically unheard of. The following list incorporates and expands upon the variant sinspawn found on page 246 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2.

Aerial Sinspawn (+4 Dex, +2 Con, fly 60 ft. [good], CR +1): Xanderghul, Runelord of Pride, believed his mighty sinspawn should soar above the heads of his enemies, though Earthfall cut short his experiments. Aerial pridespawn are therefore rare, lurking in the mountaintop ruins of Cyrusian, but are still far more common than aerial variants of other types of sinspawn.

Aquatic Sinspawn (swim 30 ft., aquatic subtype): Not to be outdone on any battlefield, Runelord Alaznist developed wrathspawn with gills and webbed hands and feet to serve as marines. Belimarius and Sorshen followed suit, breeding aquatic envyspawn and lustspawn respectively to guard their domains' watery borders. Other types of aquatic sinspawn are rare.

Envyspawn (+2 Str, -2 Cha): Short and slight, envyspawn are compelled to hunt and spy upon their enemies. They obsess over comparing their enemies' possessions and prowess to their own. Envyspawn often become <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">rangers</a> or <a href="classdisplay6b76.html?ItemName=Slayers">slayers</a>.

Fleshdregs: Products of malfunctioning runewells, botched rituals, and the like, <a href="monsterdisplay0649.html?ItemName=Fleshdreg">fleshdregs</a> are squat, half-formed sinspawn, little more than a mouth on legs. Nevertheless, their sinful bites can mangle the bodies and minds of their enemies, and sinspawn treat fleshdregs as guard animals or pets. Faulty runewells may even spit out wads of hungry flesh known as <a href="monsterdisplay3d01.html?ItemName=Fleshdreg%20Swarm">fleshdreg swarms</a>.

Gluttonspawn (+2 Con, -2 Dex): Hardy despite their obesity, gluttonspawn often become <a href="classdisplay3651.html?ItemName=Fighter">fighters</a>. A few rare individuals become <a href="classdisplaya6cb.html?ItemName=Alchemists">alchemists</a>, gorging themselves on the mutagens they concoct.

Greedspawn (+2 Dex -2 Wis): Standing 7 feet high with glittering, gold-tinted veins, greedspawn usually become <a href="classdisplay9bea.html?ItemName=Rogues">rogues</a>, but some focus their avarice into objects they hoard and become <a href="classdisplay9d49.html?ItemName=Occultists">occultists</a>.

Lustspawn (+4 Cha, -2 Con, -2 Wis): These sinspawn sport perfectly formed male and female bodies that stand in odd contrast to their horrific faces, claws, and legs. Unlike their pallid kin, lustspawn often have brightly colored hides. Capable of intercourse but not procreation, lustspawn indulge themselves at every opportunity. Many lustspawn become <a href="classdisplay89f0.html?ItemName=Sorcerers">sorcerers</a> or <a href="classdisplayb504.html?ItemName=Mesmerists">mesmerists</a>, though sinspawn <a href="classdisplay3fa3.html?ItemName=Wizard">enchanters</a> and <a href="classdisplay40da.html?ItemName=Witches">witches</a> are not unknown.

Pridespawn (+4 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha): The near-skeletal pridespawn are proud of their thick manes of hair, which they alone of any sinspawn can grow. They often become <a href="classdisplay5e73.html?ItemName=wizards">Wizards</a>, although pridespawn <a href="classdisplayc319.html?ItemName=Magus">magi</a> and <a href="classdisplay7a60.html?ItemName=Psychics">psychics</a> are not unknown.

Slothspawn (+2 Wis, -2 Dex): Slothspawn appear weighed down by cloaks of excess skin, yet they scuttle about on shrunken legs with alarming speed. They often become <a href="classdisplaybf56.html?ItemName=Clerics">clerics</a> or <a href="classdisplay43ac.html?ItemName=Warpriests">warpriests</a>, venerating <a href="deitydisplaya3ab.html?ItemName=Lamashtu">Lamashtu</a>, <a href="deitydisplaya42b.html?ItemName=Rovagug">Rovagug</a>, or whichever locally popular demon lord demands the least effort. Slothspawn <a href="classdisplay3fa3.html?ItemName=Wizard">conjurers</a> and <a href="classdisplay1d06.html?ItemName=summoners">Summoners</a> prefer to let their summoned creatures labor on their behalf.

Wrathspawn: The original creations of Alaznist, the bloodthirsty wrathspawn are the most common variety of sinspawn. Many become <a href="classdisplay58d8.html?ItemName=Barbarians">barbarians</a>, <a href="classdisplayd7eb.html?ItemName=Brawlers">brawlers</a>, or <a href="classdisplay0625.html?ItemName=Fighters">fighters</a>. Exceptional wrathspawn tap into the essence of sin inside them and become <a href="classdisplay47b6.html?ItemName=Bloodragers">bloodragers</a> instead.
