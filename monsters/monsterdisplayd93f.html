Special Abilities

Bloodbird (Su) Bleed damage dealt by a vilderavn's natural
and manufactured weapons stacks with itself and other
sources of bleed damage. In addition, the bleeding it causes
is difficult to stanch-a successful DC 26 Heal check or a
DC 26 caster level check (if using a magical healing effect) is
required to stop the bleed damage. This is a curse effect.
The DC is Charisma-based.
Fate Warden (Su) A vilderavn gains an insight bonus to its AC
equal to its Wisdom bonus, and as an immediate action it
can add its Wisdom bonus as an insight bonus on a saving
throw or opposed skill check.
Raven Hexes (Sp, Su) A vilderavn can use the hexes listed in
its special attacks entry as an 18th-level witch. The save DC to resist a
vilderavn's hex is 25, and is Charisma-based. A vilderavn
also uses its Charisma modifier, instead of its Intelligence
modifier, to determine the other variables of its hexes.
Raven Knight (Sp) When a vilderavn assumes humanoid form
with its change shape ability, it loses its natural armor bonus
but becomes fully garbed in black +5 full plate that is almost
part of its body. This armor has no movement speed penalty,
maximum Dexterity bonus, or armor check penalty. (For a
typical vilderavn, this changes its AC to 38 and its flat-footed
AC to 30.) Also as part of the transformation, it gains a +5
cruel keen falchion formed from its vicious talons. These
items are part of the vilderavn's being and disappear when
it is slain. A vilderavn in humanoid form is considered to
be proficient in all types of armor, shields (except tower
shields), and martial weapons.
Shatter Loyalties (Su) A vilderavn's frightful presence
creates disloyalty, doubt, and dissension in addition to
fear. Creatures that fail their saves are no longer treated
as allies to other creatures and can't provide flanking, use
or benefit from teamwork feats or aid another actions, or
allow other creatures to move through their space. Any
spell or effect that requires a willing target fails if used on
an affected creature, and even harmless effects require
an attack roll (if applicable) and require affected creatures
to attempt a saving throw to resist their effects (if a save
is allowed). Creatures that are immune to fear can still be
affected by the shatter loyalties component of a vilderavn's
frightful presence; they ignore the shaken condition but
are otherwise affected as described above. This is a mind-affecting
effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.
Soul Eater (Ex) A vilderavn's bite attack threatens a critical hit
on an 18-20. If a vilderavn kills a humanoid foe with a critical
hit from its bite attack (including a coup de grace), it can
tear out the victim's heart and consume its soul. Creatures
that witness this savagery are frightened for 1d4 rounds, or
shaken for 1 round if they succeed at a DC 27 Will save. Also,
the vilderavn gains the benefits of death knell, and the slain
creature is affected as per rest eternal (caster level 18th).
While the target remains dead, the vilderavn gains access
to that creature's memories and can use its change shape
ability to assume a perfect likeness of the slain creature,
gaining a +10 bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks made to
impersonate it. The vilderavn can store any number of souls.
Slaying the vilderavn ends all its ongoing rest eternal
effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

A vilderavn is a malicious shapechanging spirit whose
typical form is that of an oversized raven with a wingspan
of 6 to 8 feet that stands 2 to 3 feet tall. Vilderavns
sometimes roam in the shape of wolves or dire wolves,
and are known to appear as monstrous raven-wolf hybrids
akin to black-feathered perytons. They can also walk in
humanoid guise when they wish, often assassinating
victims of rank and assuming their victims' places.
They have an unusual affection for their swords, often
granting them threatening names.

Vilderavns are drawn to war and suffering, often
haunting battlefields-especially during protracted
sieges. They are particularly drawn toward rulers and
commanders, and might insinuate themselves into the
confidence of leaders with their clever tongues and deft
rumor-mongering. They are deceivers and heralds of
woe, seeking to lure the rulers of mortal kingdoms into
jealous feuds and fruitless wars with one another. To do
this, they often cultivate reputations as master duelists,
brilliant mercenary leaders, or unjustly banished
nobility from distant lands. Regardless of their guises,
vilderavns' advice usually seems wise and perceptive,
steeped in an expansive knowledge of history,
political rivalries, and cultural clashes, along
with insights into the ways of war. Yet while
their counsel might lead to early victories,
their ultimate purpose is to bring doom to all
sides. At the height of the battle, when victory seems
nigh, a vilderavn often instigates a wave of betrayal,
crippling erstwhile allies and bringing devastation.
Only when a ruler's kingdom or a commander's
army lies in ruins does a vilderavn administer the
coup de grace.

It is said that the first vilderavns were created by
a vicious fey lord as a check and counter to the
hubris of mortal rulers, especially those who
put their trust in armies and steel to drive back
the wild lands. The boasting and braggadocio
of those mortals who believed they had
achieved mastery over the followers of the old
ways offended the fey lord, who sent vilderavns
to infiltrate their ranks. The vilderavns watched
from the shadows and learned the ways of mortals,
the better to use their own weapons and strategies
against them. In torment and blood, they peeled
away the secrets of mortals, laying the last truths of their
hearts bare before bestowing the gift of death on them. Even
in death, however, a vilderavn's victims languish, stretched
across the threshold of the afterlife yet tethered to the fey
spirit's merciless heart. Their minds are open books for this
fey to unravel and use in cruel and hurtful ways.

Vilderavns sometimes amuse themselves by offering
false oracular advice or tempting bargains to mortals,
promising power in exchange for the blood of innocents.
A vilderavn typically claims to be cursed into its animal
form, insisting that only innocent blood will release it.
If its mark is foolish enough to accept its bargain, the
vilderavn often returns wearing the innocent's flesh
to torment its supposed ally and drive her to insanity. A
vilderavn might even offer an irony-laced limited wish to
sweeten its bargains and truly test a mortal's resolve.
