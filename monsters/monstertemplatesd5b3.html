Creatures with the First World template live on the First World, and can be summoned using spells such as <a href="spelldisplay8f6e.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%201">summon monster</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7667.html?ItemName=summon%20nature's%20ally%201">summon nature's ally</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay8f45.html?ItemName=planar%20ally">planar ally</a>. A First World creature's CR increases by 1 only if the base creature has 5 or more HIt Dice. A First World creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: Type the creature counts as both its base type as well as fey for any effects related to type; Senses gains low-light vision; Defensive Abilities gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table below, +4 bonus against mind-affecting effects; SR gains SR equal to new CR + 5; Special a First World creature killed while on the First World does not travel to the Boneyard, but simply reappears elsewhere in the First World 1d10 days later as if raised by resurrection, save that the negative level and Constitution drain from that spell cannot force it below 1st level or a Constitution score of 1. At the GM's option, the creature may be reincarnated (as per <a href="spelldisplay0315.html?ItemName=reincarnate">reincarnate</a>) instead.
