Special Abilities

Incorrigible Charm (Su) A blackwood satyr emits an aura of
incorrigible charm out to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature
that begins its turn in this area of effect must succeed at
a DC 19 Will save, or be affected as per the spell charm
person. The blackwood satyr can suppress or resume this
ability at will. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

Pipes (Su) A blackwood satyr can focus and empower his
magical abilities by playing haunting melodies on his
panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot
radius must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected
by charm monster, deep slumber, reckless infatuation, or
suggestion, depending on what tune the satyr chooses. A
creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes-
effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24
hours, but can still be affected by the blackwood satyr's
other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his
pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spelllike
abilities, and if separated from them, he may continue
to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are
masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1
week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Blackwood satyrs are an especially infamous breed of fey
indigenous to the Verduran Forest, which straddles the
borders of Andoran, Taldor, and Galt. They are well known
throughout southeastern Avistan for exuding the pleasantly
sweet aroma of blackwood tar, from which they gain their
name. Though the human population surrounding the
Verduran Forest seldom ventures deep into the fey wood
for anything other than logging, the blackwood satyrs
seem to take perverse pleasure in waylaying noble lords
and ladies during their passage down the heavily traveled
Sellen River, playing songs from the river's bank to lure
vessels closer and enthrall all aboard.
