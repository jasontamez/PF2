Tactics

Before Combat The sorcerer casts mage armor on herself.
During Combat The sorcerer stays away from melee, hurling spells at foes. She usually begins with black tentacles or grease, the better to restrict enemy mobility in the already difficult swamp terrain, then follows up with ranged damage spells or by casting haste on the tribe's strongest warriors.
Base Statistics Without mage armor, the lizardfolk's statistics are AC 17, touch 11, flat-footed 17.

Description

Lizardfolk sorcerers can have any bloodline, but most claim (rightly or not) that their magic is the result of ancient interbreeding with majestic dragons. With the blood of dragons coursing through her veins, the sorcerer is respected and feared by members of her tribe. They could see her as an omen-of good or ill-and might send her away to live on the outskirts of tribal land if she can't quickly learn to control her powers. Nevertheless, though the sorcerer might stand apart from the rest of her tribe, she almost always comes to her kin's defense in their times of need.
