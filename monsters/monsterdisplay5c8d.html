Special Abilities

Clobber (Ex) When a gegenees damages a creature with three or more successful melee attacks in the same round, the gegenees can perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against the creature as a free action. If the awesome blow succeeds, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1d4 rounds, in addition to the normal effects of the awesome blow. The save DC is Strength-based.

Extra Attacks (Ex) When a gegenees attacks as a standard action, it can make two additional attacks, even if its movement would normally restrict it to one attack. These additional attacks must be made with its other arms, and are made at its highest base attack bonus with a -2 penalty.

Description

The gegenees are a race of six-armed giants who dwell in lands far from civilization. They prefer weapons such as clubs and spears, dress in skins and furs, and embellish their bodies with elaborate tattoos and ritual scarification. Though not malevolent, gegenees are territorial, superstitious, and exceptionally xenophobic. They have an innate distrust for arcane spellcasters in particular, and gegenees with innate sorcerous talents are quickly exiled from their clans.

Gegenees tattoos are stylized patterns that tell the story of the individual as well as the histories of that gegenees's most honored forebears. Consequently, gegenees are particularly infuriated by creatures that attempt to copy their tattoo patterns for aesthetic purposes, as this is tantamount to laying claim to the family legacies of the gegenees.

Each gegenees clan is guided by a chieftain, who is advised by the venerable mothers' the clan's three oldest and most revered women. Possessing great wisdom and supernatural gifts, the venerable mothers are also blind, for they pluck out their eyes to prove their devotion to the clan. Their every word is considered sacrosanct.

Gegenees are 21 feet tall and weigh 14,000 pounds.

Venerable Mother

Venerable mothers develop powerful abilities in exchange for their loss of sight. They have Charisma scores of at least 15 as well as the clouded vision oracle curse as a 20th-level oracle. Once per day, they can use commune with nature, legend lore, and true seeing as spell-like abilities.

Exceptional venerable mothers typically advance with oracle levels.
