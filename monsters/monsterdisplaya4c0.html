Special Abilities

Dream Theft (Su) While in the same space as a dreaming creature, or when touching the boundary of a dreamscape, the hag can force the dreaming creature into a lucid body and enter its dreamscape-this is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If the hag deals enough damage to kill the lucid body (despite the dreamer's ability to perform impossible deeds), instead of the dreamer waking up harmlessly, the hag can trap the creature's dreaming mind in her dreamstone (see below), causing its body to remain in a mindless coma indefinitely (even magic like miracle and wish can at best transport the caster to the location of the trapped mind).

Dreamstone (Su) Every dreamthief hag carries a dreamstone-a gemstone crafted from the petrified tears of a dream dragon and worth at least 2,200 gp. The stone is psychically attuned by the hag's spirit and proximity. If the hag dies or is no longer in possession of her stone, it remains attuned for only 24 hours. The dreamstone can hold up to 20 dreaming minds stolen by the hag. A dreamthief hag can release a stored mind, sifting out its essence, to regain 2 PE. The mind then returns to its body, but the hag's tampering usually inflicts deep mental scars, resulting in new phobias, nervous ticks, or sleep disorders. A dreamthief hag can use her dream theft ability and etherealness only if she has her dreamstone.

Mind Block (Su) A creature bitten by a dreamthief hag cannot cast spells or attempt Intelligence checks or Intelligence-based skill checks for 1 round. Creatures with at least 1 mythic rank are immune to this ability. This is a poison effect.

Description

These more powerful cousins of night hags often wander the Dimension of Dreams, stealing dreaming minds, trapping them within dreamstones, and selling them to the highest bidder. While few denizens of any plane trust dreamthief hags, some welcome them as merchants. Many powerful evil beings find captured minds to be useful components in dark rituals or profane research.

Even those who hold dreamthief hags in contempt are careful not to offend them, for their bite contains a venom capable of temporarily paralyzing a victim's mind, and the hags have few scruples about capturing even longtime commercial partners' minds if the hags feel they have been disrespectful. While it's difficult to determine exactly what harm befalls the minds in dreamthief hags' care, those who have been released by them are never quite the same, and rarely have a nightmare-free night of sleep again.

Customizing Hag Covens

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s3z?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Coven">Blood of the Coven</a>
Any group of three hags can form a coven, but realistically, many types of hags will never cross paths or deign to work with one another. Blood hags are loath to form covens that are not under their control. Annis hags are likewise domineering, rarely working with more powerful hags. Storm hags usually prefer allying with other storm hags, but they will occasionally form covens with green hags or sea hags. Sea hags sometimes seek out a green hag to lead them. Mute hags-among the most powerful of mortal hags-relish the destruction of relationships, and their involvement in a coven is typically transient, lasting only as long as whatever barrier prompted them to seek sisters in the first place. Night hags and dreamthief hags are outsiders that wander the planes in search of victims. These cautious schemers do not hesitate to involve mortal hags in their machinations, readily joining covens when it proves expedient. Their immortality grants them great patience and enough time to plan contingencies so that betraying them becomes a risky proposition.

A typical hag coven can cast the spells listed in the green hag's monster entry (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 167). Blood hags, storm hags, and winter hags always grant the spells and abilities listed in their bestiary entries. To reflect the diversity of powers hags can invoke, Game Masters can customize the spell lists of covens based on their membership; each type of hag makes specific spells available to cast as coven magic.

All covens can cast the following spells, regardless of the hags that comprise them: <a href="spelldisplayc394.html?ItemName=Animate%20Dead">animate dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayedf1.html?ItemName=Baleful%20Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4414.html?ItemName=Bestow%20Curse">bestow curse</a>, <a href="spelldisplay3517.html?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya33d.html?ItemName=Commune">commune</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf711.html?ItemName=Dream">dream</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya816.html?ItemName=Forcecage">forcecage</a>, <a href="spelldisplay218d.html?ItemName=Mind%20Blank">mind blank</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7555.html?ItemName=Reincarnate">reincarnate</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya200.html?ItemName=Speak%20with%20Dead">speak with dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplay1ac4.html?ItemName=Veil">veil</a>, <a href="spelldisplay42e8.html?ItemName=Vision">vision</a>

If dryads, nymphs, and sprites represent the grace and beauty of unspoiled nature, then surely the annis hag, green hag, and sea hag embody its savage, destructive side. Though not fey themselves, hags appear to be somehow tied to nature, even if no more than as a distorted reflection of it. Hags are foul, wicked creatures, warped with cruelty and evil. Uniformly female and invariably repulsive, these misshapen crones plot dark deeds over bubbling cauldrons, either singly or in sinister triads known as covens.
