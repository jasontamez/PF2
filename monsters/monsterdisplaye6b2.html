Spark Nettle - Monsters







Spark Nettle

A delicate-looking creature floats silently in midair. Resembling a large jellyfish, it has a fringe of bird's feathers around its quivering central mass and long tentacles trailing from its center, with each tentacle ending in a snapping beak. It sings to itself as it flies, each beak making a different note in an eerie harmony.

Special Abilities

Poison (Su) Levitation poison: Bite or contact-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 5 rounds; effect 1 Dexterity damage + levitate (victim rises 10 feet as per the spell per failed save); cure 2 consecutive saves. Skrik nettle poison can be cured by either remove poison or dispel magic, as if it were caster level 8th. The effect's CL equals the skrik nettle's Hit Dice. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Spill Poison (Su) Anytime a skrik nettle is damaged by a slashing or piercing melee weapon, it splashes its poison on the opponent who damaged it. That opponent must save or be affected by the skrik nettle's poison. Weapons with reach allow their wielders to avoid this effect.

Description

Shoals of skrik nettles float through the skies of the First World. They sail like boats, driven before the wind and using their feathers to tack and turn. They sing as they fly, jabbering and chirping to each other in complex harmonies. The average skrik nettle shoal consists of three dozen or more of the majestic creatures, but these flocks are often split up during the roaring storms so common to the First World. Lone skrik nettles may be encountered in smaller numbers, confused and trying to find their way back to their kin.

Skrik nettles range in size from a few inches across (for a newly spawned hatchling) to the size of gigantic, scintillating clouds. Most, however, are no more than 8 or 9 feet across.
