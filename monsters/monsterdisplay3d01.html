Special Abilities

Arcane Bite (Su) A fleshdreg swarm's swarm damage is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

Sin-Scent (Su) Fleshdreg swarms have scent against creatures whose nature reflects the fleshdreg swarm's related sin. For example, a wrathful fleshdreg swarm can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular fleshdreg swarm can scent.

Description

Fleshdreg swarms form from scraps and leftovers of malformed fleshdregs and incomplete sinspawn. These foul, misshapen creatures pour out of runewells by the hundreds, seeking sinful flesh to destroy. Little more than pests, these swarms attack indiscriminately. Some malfunctioning runewells and other fleshvats produce nothing more these days than swarm upon swarm of these pests.
