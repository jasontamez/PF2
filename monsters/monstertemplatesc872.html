Creatures with the resolute template live in planes where law is paramount. They can be summoned using spells such as summon monster and planar ally. A resolute creature's CR increases by +1 only if the base creature has 5 or more HD. A resolute creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: Senses gains darkvision 60 ft.; Defensive Abilities gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table; SR gains SR equal to new CR +5; Special Attacks smite chaos 1/day as a swift action (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls and damage bonus equal to HD against chaotic foes; smite persists until target is dead or the resolute creature rests).
