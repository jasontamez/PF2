Special Abilities

Carapace (Su) The tarrasque's scales deflect cones, lines, rays, and magic missile spells, rendering the tarrasque immune to such effects. There is a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise it is simply negated.

Powerful Leaper (Ex) The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify Acrobatics checks made to jump, and has a +24 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump.

Rush (Ex) Once per minute, for 1 round, the tarrasque's speed increases to 150 feet, and its Acrobatics bonus on checks made to jump increases to +87.

Spines (Ex) The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail. Make an attack roll for each spine- all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.

Description

The Tarrasque, referred to in ancient texts as the "Armageddon Engine," is the greatest of Rovagug's spawn. Its previously recorded devastation of Ninshabur and Avistan occurred in -632 AR, and culminated in the destruction of the flying Shory city of Kho. It was sealed away in a cavern somewhere in the Inner Sea region. Although the location of this cavern has been lost, rumors of possible locations include nearly every mountainous region, the Mwangi Expanse, and even under the Isle of Kortos itself.

The statistics presented here for the Tarrasque differ slightly from those in the Bestiary-this version more accurately represents the Tarrasque as the mightiest of Rovagug's spawn.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
