Special Abilities

Fertile Regeneration (Su) Once per day, if the cervine protector is in the area of a plant growth spell used to generate overgrowth at the time the spell is cast, it gains fast healing 5 for 10 minutes. The cervine protector maintains the fast healing even if it leaves the affected area. This effect ends immediately if the cervine protector is in the area of a diminish plants spell used to prune growth.

Description

A cervine protector might be encountered alongside the Grim White Stag, or as the companion of one of Erastil's clergy. In natural settings sacred to Erastil, solitary cervine protectors sometimes stand vigil, ensuring that no taint befalls their charge.

Characters with the Leadership feat can take a cervine protector as a cohort at cohort level 10th or higher.
