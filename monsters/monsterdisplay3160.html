Special Abilities

Whelp Family (Su) A su always carries 3-6 (1d4+2) Diminutive
infant su on its back that share a telepathic bond with their
parent, acting as extra eyes for the adult. Area effects
target the su and not its whelps, but individual whelps can
be targeted with attacks (AC 18; 4 hp). If the su dies, its
whelps die as well. A helpless su's whelps can
be easily killed or removed from
the su (removing them
from the su also
immediately kills
them). If all of
a su's whelps
are slain, the su
immediately loses its all-around vision and improved evasion
and is sickened until it regains at least one new whelp. A su
replaces lost whelps at a rate of one whelp per week.

Prehensile Tail (Ex) A su can use its tail to attempt a dirty
trick, disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuver against an
adjacent opponent as a swift action that does not provoke an
attack of opportunity.

Whelp Magic (Sp) Su whelps possess psychic powers that fade
with age. As a swift action, a su can command one of its
whelps to activate a psychic spell using the psychic magic
special ability. A whelp can also maintain concentration on a
spell, provided the su spends a swift action. Any spells that
grant bonuses to their target apply to the su as well as its
whelps. The whelps have a pool of 3 PE per whelp, and each
time a whelp dies the remaining pool reduces by 3. A su
with no whelps can't use psychic magic.

Description

Hateful and melancholic, the psychic marsupials called su
can feel their minds weaken as they mature, and take out
their frustration on any creatures who enter their forests.

All su bear young. After mating, they implant each other's
back-pouches with oily, tumor-like eggs which hatch over
the next year into tiny, psychically gifted humanoids. These
young su cling to their parents' backs, feeding on parasites
and scraps. Born at the apex of their psychic abilities, baby
su slowly change shape and lose their powers over their first
year-by the time they reach their full predatory form, all
psychic magic has vanished. These furious new adults then
leave to become providers for
their own whelps. A grown su is
5 feet long and 90 pounds.
