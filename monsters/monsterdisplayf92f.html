Special Abilities

Bog Rot (Su) Curse and disease-slam; save
Fort DC 15; onset 1 minute; frequency
1/day; effect 1d6 Con and 1d6 Dex;
cure -. Bog rot is both a curse and
disease, and can be cured only if
the curse is first removed, at
which point the disease can
be magically removed. Even
after the curse element of
bog rot is lifted, a creature
suffering from it cannot
recover naturally over
time. Anyone casting a
conjuration (healing) spell
on the afflicted creature
must succeed on a DC 20
caster level check or the
spell is wasted and the
healing has no effect.
Anyone who dies from
bog rot melts into a
noisome sludge and
cannot be raised without a resurrection spell or greater
magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Drowning Aura (Su) All creatures within a 30-foot radius of
a swamp mummy must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or
be unable to speak or breathe. A creature can still hold its
breath, and creatures that don't breathe air are unaffected.
Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot
be affected again by the same swamp mummy's drowning
ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting affect. The save
DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Strangled into unlife in the filth and muck of the deep
mire, swamp mummies haunt the festering depths of
isolated, desolate fenlands.

Some swamp mummies are cursed by dark powers to
return to unlife, while others are the victims of sacrifices
or criminal executions in which the bodies were thrown
into a peat bog. The nature of the death and the emotional
power of the victim are both contributing factors as to
whether or not the victim crawls from its swampy grave as
a swamp mummy.

Swamp mummies-also often called bog or peat
mummies-rarely, if ever, leave their marshy
realms. Those that do most often venture forth
from the swamp to take revenge on their slayers.
While most swamp mummies are motivated by
vengeance, many fulfill these dark yearnings
in a more general sense. Filled with wrath and
hatred for the living, they mercilessly attack any
living creatures that dare to venture into their
dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo
over their putrid homes, driving away the natural
animals dwelling therein and often alerting
travelers to the relentless danger.

Swamp mummies delight in infecting
living foes with bog rot, believing that
adding their victims' essence to their
gloomy domains expands their power.
After battle, they carry away the bodies of
their fallen victims to sink them in deep,
isolated pools. Thus, even enemies that
escape the bog rot become one
with the swamp mummy's home.
Most swamp mummies
are Medium humanoids,
typically arising from
the submerged corpses
of human, lizardfolk, or
elven victims-though
instances of swamp
mummies arising from the
corpses of other races is
not unknown.
