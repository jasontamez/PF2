Special Abilities

Bay (Su) A moon dog can produce one of the following effects when it howls or barks. Each bay is a sonic effect that functions as the spell of the same name (caster level 12th) except as noted below. The save DCs are Charisma-based. A creature that successfully saves against one of these effects is immune to that bay effect, created by that moon dog, for 24 hours.

Dismissal: This effect works as per the spell dismissal, except it targets one evil extraplanar creature.

Fear: As per the spell fear, except this fear affects all evil creatures within 80 feet.

Keen Senses (Ex) Moon dogs can see twice as far as humans in low-light and normal light conditions, and can see without impairment through mist and fog.

Lick (Sp) The lick of a moon dog provides one of the following spell effects (caster level 12th) to the target: cure light wounds, neutralize poison, or remove disease. Each is usable at will by the moon dog, but can affect a given recipient only once per day.

Lunar Light (Su) When in dim light, a moon dog can create dappled shadows and pale luminous patterns in a 60-foot-radius emanation. This effect causes evil creatures to become fascinated (Will DC 19 negates). Good-aligned creatures in this area gain the benefits of protection from evil (caster level 12th). Creating this lunar light is a full-round action, and the moon dog must concentrate to maintain it. The shadow weave remains centered on the moon dog as it moves. Evil creatures saving against lunar light cannot be affected again by that moon dog's lunar light for 24 hours.

Plane Shift (Sp) A moon dog can enter the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, or Material Plane as a standard action, as if using plane shift (caster level 12th).

Description

Moon dogs are extraplanar hounds that live in nomadic packs on Elysium, traveling and hunting planar menaces where they please. Often their hunts will take them to the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, and sometimes to the remote wildernesses of the Material Plane. More often than not, they enter the Material Plane to combat irruptions of evil outsiders plaguing innocent mortals. When they do so, they often ally with powerful celestials, serving amid their forays as scouts and wise council.

Moon dogs can stand erect and wield weapons if desired, but they prefer the speed and mobility of traveling on all fours. Most moon dogs stand approximately 5 feet tall and weigh about 125 pounds.
