Proteans are serpentine outsiders of pure chaos. They have the following traits unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry. <ul><li>Blindsense (distance varies by protean type). </li><li>Immunity to acid. </li><li>Resistance to electricity 10 and sonic 10. </li><li>Constrict and grab as special attacks. </li><li>Supernatural flight. </li><li>Freedom of Movement (Su): A protean has continuous <a href="spelldisplayd71b.html?ItemName=freedom%20of%20movement">freedom of movement</a>, as per the spell. </li><li>Amorphous Anatomy (Ex): A protean's vital organs shift and change shape and position constantly. This grants it a 50% chance to ignore additional damage caused by critical hits and sneak attacks, and grants it immunity to polymorph effects (unless the protean is a willing target). A protean automatically recovers from physical blindness or deafness after 1 round by growing new sensory organs to replace those that were compromised. </li><li>Change Shape (Su): A protean's form is not fixed. Once per day as a standard action, a protean may change shape into any Small, Medium, or Large animal, elemental, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. A protean can assume its true form as a free action, and when it does so, it gains the effects of a <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> spell (CL equal to the protean's HD). </li><li>Warpwave (Su): Many proteans can create ripples in reality known as warpwaves. Yet even a protean can't predict what effects a warpwave might have. When a creature is affected by a warpwave, roll 1d20 and consult the table below to see what effect the entropic energies have.
