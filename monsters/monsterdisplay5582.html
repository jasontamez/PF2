Special Abilities

Aquatic Combatant (Ex) A gowrow's natural weapons and fighting style are adapted to its aquatic nature. Its bite and tail attacks are primary natural attacks that deal piercing damage, but above water, it can deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage with its bite and piercing and slashing damage with its tail.

Hibernate (Ex) A gowrow can dig a burrow into wet ground and hibernate for up to a decade before needing to emerge and feed.

Swim-By Attack (Ex) Known for water ambushes, gowrows gain Spring Attack as a bonus feat when swimming

Description

These violent, reptilian creatures are a lesser form of dragon that plague the rivers and lakes in which they live. They find most creatures that ply the waterways they claim distasteful, and these beasts frequently attack fishers and others who travel in small boats through their territory. Unless they are particularly hungry or irritated, gowrows typically leave larger vessels alone. A gowrow stretches over 16 feet in length and weighs nearly 2 tons.

Gowrows are devastating to local settlements. They are violent killers that slaughter livestock and threaten those who work the land far from civilization. When ranchers notice missing cattle, goats, or sheep along with other evidence of a gowrow, they often call upon the authorities or adventurers to get involved. Woodsy folk who have come across gowrow lairs describe them as caves littered with bones from dozens of different creatures, both livestock to humanoid. Some communities face raids by a gowrow year after year, but due to gowrows' periodic hibernation, the creature might vanish, only to threaten later generations of people near its lair.
