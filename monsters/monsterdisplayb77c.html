Special Abilities

Firm Grip (Ex) A spiny starfish excels at grappling prey, and it gains a +6 racial bonus on grapple checks (rather than the standard +4 bonus most creatures gain as a result of having the grab ability).

Rapid Healing (Ex) A spiny starfish heals very quickly, regaining a number of hit points each hour equal to its Hit Dice (1 hp per hour for the typical spiny starfish).

Description

Spiny starfish are marine invertebrates that wander the sea floor in search of mollusks and other slow-moving prey. Their tube feet afford them an excellent grip on their chosen food source, and they can famously expel their stomachs into subdued shellfish to digest their meals. An injured spiny starfish heals wounds quickly, even regrowing lost limbs over time.
