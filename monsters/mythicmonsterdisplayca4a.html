Special Abilities

Contingencies (Sp) Kortash Khain is under the effect of the following mythic contingencies: resist energy when he's affected by an acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic effect dealing more than 10 points of damage; teleport when he's brought below 50 hit points or unable to take actions for 1 full round; and both empowered mirror image and mythic shield of faith when he's targeted with an attack that requires an attack roll.

Disease (Su) Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight; a humanoid with 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.

Exceptional Wealth (Ex) Kortash Khain has the wealth of a 20th-level PC, rather than an NPC. This increases his CR by 1.

Description

Kortash Khain is the high priest on Golarion of the demon lord Kabriri, the Lord of Everglut. He rules as Priest-King of Nemret Noktoria, a city of bone-white towers where ghouls dwell. His city lies deep in the vaults of Sekamina in the Darklands below Osirion. Kabriri rules over the Abyssal city of Everglut, a cyclopean necropolis inhabited by ghouls and riddled with tunnels. All Kortash Khain's immortal thought is bent on replicating his master's dead city within the living world.

Though Khain has sent ambassadors to Thuvia, Osirion, and their neighbors to conduct trade negotiations, thoughts of war, insurrection, and murder are never far from his mind. Much of his wrath has been turned against the nearby inhabitants of the Darklands' his purges have largely depopulated Sekamina in the vicinity of his city. A fortunate few are merely dead and devoured-all of the rest have been absorbed into Khain's ever-growing ghoul army.

Not even the genies of Garund have escaped the Priest- King's capture squads. Many have been defeated and converted by the powers of death into great ghuls, often serving in positions of prominence as atamans, beys, and pashas under Khain's dominion. The most powerful of these are four great ghul oracles called the Quadrate Pillars, each formed from the undead remnant of a genie twisted into serving in death the element that was its opposite in life. A few renegade shaitans have been converted to the worship of Kabriri, and serve Kortash Khain as architects, engineers, and builders in his city. This socalled Blackstone Brotherhood is held in high esteem in Nemret Noktoria not only for its architectural creations but also for its members' prowess as hunters. They infiltrate their genie brethren and lure them into ambushes.

Kortash Khain and any other clerics or oracles worshiping Kabriri gain several unique options when summoning or creating undead to serve them. They add the following creatures to their summon monster lists: I-fiendish human zombie (standard or fast zombie); II-fiendish ghoul, fiendish plague zombie; III-fiendish ghast; IV-giant fiendish ghast; V-ghul; VI-fiendish ghul, great ghul; VII-fiendish great ghul, fiendish shaitan; VIII-black jinni; IX-fiendish black jinni. When using create undead, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can create a ghul or great ghul from the corpse of a genie rather than creating a mummy (minimum caster level 15th). When creating a ghoul, ghast, ghul, or great ghul with this spell, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can also apply the fiendish template to that creature. This requires the caster to double the normal material component cost or sacrifice a living humanoid as an additional material component of casting the spell.
