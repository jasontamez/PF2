Radiant creatures are mortal creatures who have been destroyed by the overwhelming fury of the Positive Energy Plane's energies. Normally, the souls of such creatures are expelled into the River of Souls and travel to the Boneyard for judgment, but occasionally they are instantaneously reincarnated as radiant creatures-glowing incarnations of their previous forms infused with positive energy.

A radiant creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same. This simple template can be applied only to a living creature whose CR is 3 or higher.

Quick/Rebuild Rules (CR +1): Senses gains darkvision 60 ft.; Defensive Abilities gains DR 5/-; fast healing equal to HD; immunity to blindness, fire, mind-affecting effects, and all effects from positive-dominant essence traits; Special Attacks one natural attack (or unarmed strike if the creature has no natural attacks) gains the ability to create a powerful burst of radiance that blinds the creature struck for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the radiant creature's HD + the radiant creature's Constitution modifier); this ability triggers automatically on the first successful attack in a round, regardless of how many attacks the radiant creature attempts.

Radiant creatures cannot exist long outside of the Positive Energy Plane and treat all other planes as if they had the major negative-dominant essence trait.
