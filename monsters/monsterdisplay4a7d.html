Description

Karkadanns roam the barren and wind-swept deserts of the world where their deep bellows can be heard for miles. Their solitary horns have led many to assume that they are a breed or variant of unicorn, but karkadanns bristle at that claim.

Known for their aggression and physical power, karkadanns are proud warriors that rarely back down from a fight. They readily charge into combat, seeking to impale their foes on their wicked horns. Legend says that the only thing that can calm an enraged karkadann is the song of a ring dove.

Some desert travelers seek out karkadanns because of their mystical ability to purge a creature of toxins. Many a traveler stung by a giant scorpion or bitten by a viper hopes for nothing more than to come across a karkadann. This treatment isn't granted lightly. Karkadanns are narcissistic and self-serving, so they often demand outlandish favors in return for curing a poisoned creature. They size up what the person can reliably pay and demand just a bit more. Some alchemists, however, have learned that the ability to purge poisons isn't just supernatural, and that some part of that power lies within the karkadann's devious horn.

Karkadann Horn

A karkadann's horn is a potent ingredient in treating most poisons. When combined with rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp, a karkadann horn can be used as an additional material component when casting neutralize poison to grant the caster a +5 competence bonus on her caster level checks to end the poisons' effects. When using karkadann horn as an ingredient while making a Heal check to treat poison, the user gains a +5 bonus on the check, and, if successful, the treated character gains a +8 competence bonus on her saving throw against the poison instead of +4.
