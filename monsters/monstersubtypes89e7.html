Demodands are chaotic evil outsiders who stalk the Abyss. Unless otherwise noted in the creature's entry, a demodand has the following traits. <ul><li>Immunity to acid and poison. </li><li>Resistance to fire 10 and cold 10. </li><li>A demodand's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction. </li><li>Except when otherwise noted, demodands speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Common. </li><li>Faith-Stealing Strike (Su): When a demodand's natural attack or melee weapon damages a creature capable of casting divine spells, that creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1 round. Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is immune to further faith-stealing strikes from that particular demodand for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. </li><li>Heretical Soul (Ex): All demodands gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against divine spells. In addition, any attempts to scry on a demodand using divine magic automatically fail. The caster can see the scried area normally, but the demodand simply does not appear. </li><li>Summon (Sp): Demodands share the ability to summon others of their kind, typically another of their type or a small number of less powerful demodands.</li></ul>
