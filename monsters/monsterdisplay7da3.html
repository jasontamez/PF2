Special Abilities

Daemonic Pact (Su) Urdefhans are infused with daemonic energy; as an immediate action, an urdefhan can attempt to allow this energy to consume its soul (50% chance of success per attempt). If it succeeds, the urdefhan dies and releases a 5-foot-radius burst of negative energy that deals 2d6 points of damage (DC 14 Reflex half). The save DC is Con-based.

Strength Damage (Su) An urdefhan's bite drains vitality, turning the skin and muscle around the wound transparent and causing 2 points of Strength damage unless the target succeeds on a DC 14 Fortitude save. The flesh remains transparent until the Strength damage is healed, but this does not have any other effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Infused with fell energies from Abaddon, urdefhans are an unsightly race dedicated to war. They have developed many strange weapons, but none are more iconic than the two-bladed rhoka sword. Rhoka swords are exotic one-handed melee weapons-all urdefhans are proficient in their use. With such weapons, an urdefhan seeks to inflict as much death as possible upon the world before it perishes, so that its daemonic lords are pleased. Most male urdefhans are sterile-as a result, the women often turn to conjured daemons for mates. The products of such unions are usually typical urdefhans, but sometimes result in half-fiend urdefhans-these monsters usually rise to positions of great power in their violent society.

Daemonic Parents

Urdefhans frequently summon daemons from Abaddon to sire new generations of urdefhans. Such pairings occasionally result in the creation of half-fiends, who are destined to become leaders in urdefhan society. Erodaemons (Horsemen of the Apocalypse 48) are the most common type of daemons summoned to breed with urdefhans. A variant half-fiend template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 171) specific to daemon couplings with erodaemons is presented here. If an element of the half-fiend template is not mentioned, that element is not adjusted.

Half-Erodaemon

A half-erodaemon resembles a blue-skinned humanoid with a set of protruding, stub-like horns. Half-erodaemon urdefhans have a full set of black ram horns and white blood instead of the traditional blue blood.

Speed: A half-erodaemon does not gain a fly speed.

Change Shape (Su): A half-erodaemon can use this ability to assume the form of the loved one of any humanoid creature affected by its detect thoughts spell-like ability. The half-erodaemon gains a +10 bonus on its Bluff and Disguise checks to impersonate a loved one of its target.

Wilting Bite (Su): A half-erodaemon is treated as if it were one size category larger than its actual size for the purpose of its bite attack's damage, and gains the grab special attack with its bite. A non-urdefhan halferodaemon gains the Strength damage special ability of a normal urdefhan (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 276). Half-erodaemon urdefhans gain a +1 racial bonus to the Strength damage of their bite and a +2 racial bonus to the DC of the associated saving throw.

Alternate Spell-Like Abilities: Replace desecrate with detect thoughts. Replace unholy blight with unnatural lust. Replace poison 3/day with modify memory 3/day. Replace contagion with crushing despair. Replace unhallow with utter contempt.

Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Dex +4, Con +2, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +6.
