Description

The fact that these sharks dwell in shallow coastal waters places them in direct contact with those making a living from the sea. It's not uncommon to hear stories of jigsaw sharks leaping from the water and taking out dockworkers or fishermen in small boats. Their patchwork coloration of browns and blue-grays partly inspires their name.
