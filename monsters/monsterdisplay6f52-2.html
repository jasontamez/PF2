Special Abilities

Luck Touch (Su) With a claw attack or touch attack, an ovinnik can alter a creature's luck. If the target fails a DC 14 Will save, it either gains a +4 bonus or takes a -4 penalty (the ovinnik's choice) on its next three d20 rolls. The target can choose to automatically fail the saving throw, but must choose before it knows whether the touch will be beneficial or harmful. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Ovinniks make their homes in granaries and drying houses. These thin, sleek, black-furred humanoids stand only a foot high. Their eyes and features seem catlike, but they bark like dogs to scare away thieves. No one knows why an ovinnik chooses to take up residence in a particular farm's threshing house, and few would call on them willingly. A wise farmer placates resident ovinniks with frequent gifts of warm milk, pancakes, or dead roosters. By tradition, before the new year, farmers and their families go to the granary to learn their fates for the future. The ovinnik touches each of them in turn. If the ovinnik's touch is warm, the person will have good luck; if cold, she will suffer terrible misfortune in the days ahead.

These sometimes-helpful fey creatures bind themselves to rural families and live among them. Some bear a resemblance to the family's ancestors, a similarity that grows more obvious the longer they are in the family's service. House spirits use their compression ability and invisibility to stay out of the sight of those they live among.
