Special Abilities

Archive (Su) By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, an apkallu can conjure the door to a personal extradimensional archive in which it collects and preserves the lore generated by the civilizations it guides. An apkallu's archive is similar to an archmage's sanctum but is 2,000 cubic feet in size. By spending one use of its mythic power as a full-round action, the apkallu can instantly record up to nine nonmagical writings (books, scrolls, carvings, and so on) that it is touching or carrying within tomes in the archive. If an apkallu is killed or rendered unconscious (even if its regeneration is still active), its body and any items it is carrying are immediately transported to its archive. An apkallu can conjure the door to the archive of a slain apkallu at the location of the slain apkallu's death.
Mark of Restraint (Su) An apkallu that successfully bites an opponent can spend one use of its mythic power as a free action to mark that opponent with a restraining effect. This effects acts like a mark of justice that triggers if the opponent attacks the apkallu; the opponent is instantly aware of this condition. If the opponent attacks the apkallu, the mark's curse is activated and imposes a permanent -4 penalty on the opponent's attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks.
Mythic Spell-Like Abilities (Ex) An apkallu can expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic version of order's wrath as if the ability were a mythic spell.
Paralyzing Gaze (Su) Paralysis for 1 round, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 30 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. If an apkallu actively directs its gaze, a targeted creature is instead paralyzed for 1d6 rounds, or staggered for the same duration on a successful save. Lawful creatures are immune to its gaze.
Scale Surplice (Su) Apkallus wear robes of opalescent scales that function as +2 resonating scale mail with no armor check penalty, and that grant the wearer a swim speed of 40 feet, the ability to breathe water, and the ability to treat Swim as a class skill. The surplice is absorbed into an alternate form if the apkallu changes shape, and if removed, it becomes a mundane cloth robe until worn again by an apkallu. If an apkallu's scale surplice is destroyed, it can create a new one from water by spending nine uses of mythic power after 1d4 hours of uninterrupted crafting.
Spells Apkallus cast divine spells as 19th-level oracles. They do not gain access to mysteries or other oracle abilities.

Description

Apkallus are a race of psychic, oracular outsiders from Utopia, creatures of fundamental law tasked by their divine creators with the protection and guidance of lawful mortal civilizations. They are enemies of the chaotic, of those who oppose just rulership and the development of culture, laws, lore, or technology, and of those who otherwise seek to tear down the progress of mortal communities. To this end, apkallus often travel to different worlds throughout the Material Plane, guiding the rulers toward lawful religions, promoting the value of crafts and the arts, and aiding in the development of fundamental discoveries such as writing, architecture, and agriculture.
Rather than simply teaching mortals such knowledge, apkallus prefer to act as advisors, nudging those who would develop key techniques toward important discoveries, ensuring that the civilizations within their care don't come to rely on their instruction. Apkallus can communicate with any intelligent creature by using telepathy or mindlink. They are particularly fond of using shared mindscapes to grant inspiring visions of possible futures to their charges, modeling an array of potential developments in an immersive medium that transcends dry theory and exposition.
Apkallus are also archivists and preservationists, carefully recording the key historical documents that describe the progress of mortal societies so that knowledge and progress can be restored following natural disasters or periods of war or barbarism. They take great care to ensure that their extradimensional archives remain well-protected, understanding that certain information, or even knowledge of the existence of that information, can undermine a civilization's progress and self-reliance. Whenever possible, apkallus ensure that the material collected in their personal archives is transferred to the grand library vaults within Utopia. Here, they and their allies can analyze the information collected across myriad cultures and devise strategies for advancing the cause of law and order throughout the Material Plane.
Apkallus appear as large, muscular humanoids with the feathered heads of raptors, and with powerful, hawk-like wings. They dress in surplices of fish scales, which glitter with a milky iridescence that casts shimmering rainbows across their forms, and they typically carry magical bronze spears. They can also adopt two alternate forms-one human, and one merfolk-in which they move through terrestrial and aquatic settlements and cities, respectively.
While apkallus are peaceful by nature, they are nevertheless capable of defending themselves and others with powerful magic, especially in defense of Utopia or mortal cities under their protection.
