Special Abilities

Blood Drain (Ex) Whenever the hungry mist damages a victim with its swarm attack, it inflicts 1 point of Constitution drain. With each successful attack, it gains 5 temporary hit points.

Distraction (Ex) A creature that begins its turn in the same square as the hungry mist must make a Fortitude save (DC 21) or be nauseated for 1 round. In order to cast a spell while within the hungry mist, a character must succeed on a Spellcraft check (DC 21 + spell level).

Hive Mind (Ex) Any hungry mist with at least 20 hit points forms a hive mind, giving it an intelligence of 6. When a hungry mist is reduced below this hit point threshold, it becomes mindless.
