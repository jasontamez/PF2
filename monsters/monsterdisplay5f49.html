Ardoc Moilant - Monsters







Ardoc Moilant

This massive metallic biped stands on thick legs. A wide, serrated shovel serves as the brute's head, and iron pincers at the ends of its powerful arms snap open and shut.

Special Abilities

Death Throes (Ex) An Ardoc moilant explodes when it is destroyed, unless its master is within 30 feet at the moment of its destruction. When it explodes, creatures within 30 feet of it take 13d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 16 half). Half of this damage is fire and half is piercing. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Loyal Servant (Su) The Spellcraft DC to wrest or maintain control of an Ardoc moilant using <a href="spelldisplaya194.html?ItemName=control%20construct">control construct</a> or similar magic is increased by 10 for anyone other than the moilant's master. Whenever an attempt to wrest control of the moilant fails, the moilant gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour, to a maximum of 30 temporary hit points.

Resounding Burst (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can snap its vise-pincers closed with enough force to produce a shock wave of sound and disruptive magic in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. The moilant attempts a single bull rush combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature in the affected area. A creature pushed by the shock wave takes 2d6 points of sonic damage for every 5 feet it is pushed. In addition, the wave dispels magic in the area as per <a href="spelldisplay2b91.html?ItemName=greater%20dispel%20magic">greater dispel magic</a> (CL 13th). An Ardoc moilant cannot use this ability if it is grappling a creature with its vise-pincers.

Shovelhead (Ex) The serrated edge of an Ardoc moilant's shovel-like head is viciously sharp. It applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its gore attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. As a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can use its head to excavate and move earth, dust, or sand up to the size of a 5-foot cube (as per the spell <a href="spelldisplayebe9.html?ItemName=expeditious%20excavation">expeditious excavation</a>).

Stable Footing (Ex) The weight and sturdiness of its form grants an Ardoc moilant a +2 racial bonus to its CMD versus bull rush and reposition combat maneuver checks.

Thaumaturgical Field (Su) An Ardoc moilant's spell resistance is powerful but fragile. If a spell of at least 3rd level fails to penetrate the moilant's spell resistance, it loses its spell resistance for 1d4 rounds.

Vise-Pincers (Ex) An Ardoc moilant's vise-pincers are primary natural attacks that deal bludgeoning and piercing damage. Attacks that the moilant makes with its vise-pincers ignore the hardness of objects with a hardness of 15 or less. When an Ardoc moilant successfully establishes or maintains a pin, it applies its constrict damage to both the target and the target's armor or shield (Ardoc moilant's choice).

Description

Ardoc moilants are hulking thaumaturgical workhorses created to move earth or perform other heavy labor. Efficient and powerful in their movements, Ardoc moilants carry out instructions with determination and a keen awareness that betrays a higher intelligence. The Ardoc family of Kaer Maga has achieved great success by mass-producing these constructs, which sell quickly due to their adaptability, durability, and ability to work for long periods with little need for oversight.

Ardoc moilants are roughly humanoid in shape, with strong arms that end in massive gripping pincers. Moilants have large, shovel-shaped heads that they can lower to push aside dirt and stone. Of course, these tools that make the moilants so suited for heavy labor can also be used to make devastating attacks against those who interfere with their tasks.

An Ardoc moilant is 25 feet tall and weighs 10 tons.

Ecology

Every component of an Ardoc moilant's form is designed for labor, from its low, squat shape with wide feet to prevent destruction of valuable terrain, to its rune- engraved pincers that can both bore through stone and lift delicate cargo. Although not built with combat as a primary function, Ardoc moilants can be used in battle with no additional modification. They are sometimes employed as secondary enforcers or guards to watch over valuable mines, factories, or palaces under construction. An Ardoc moilant's impressive size is often sufficient to dissuade any potential threats, but persistent trespassers soon find that a moilant's gripping pincers and shovel-shaped head are formidable weapons. Although every component of an Ardoc moilant is created by or enhanced with magic, its magical nature is most apparent in its rune-carved pincers, which can create powerful magical shock waves.

Ardoc moilants are particularly clever, able to evaluate outcomes and approach assigned tasks with a keen understanding of engineering principles. One of the many secrets the Ardocs keep about the construction process is that this sophisticated programming relies on patterning from a human soul. Though this patterning is vital to the moilants' utility and popularity, the patterning ritual is exceptionally painful and sometimes fatal to the human source.

Habitat and Society

As constructs built by the Ardocs' arcane masters, moilants have no society in the traditional sense-at least according to the Ardoc family. Customers have noted, however, that Ardoc moilants seem to exhibit patterns of behavior that hint at a deeper level of consciousness and an inner drive for companionship. Unless presented with constant activity, the labor-constructs tend to gather in small groups, or even with other machines or constructs. Most Ardoc moilants are created with the ability to speak a language selected by the buyer. They speak only rarely, and their deep, gravelly voices sound like metal scraping on metal. All moilants acquire distinctive personalities and notable quirks over time, such as collecting certain types of small items or pushing rubble into shapes that mimic the runes on their pincers. Diligent owners might demand a readjustment or refund from the Ardoc family when their moilants start to demonstrate too much individual initiative, but some moilants leave their masters and strike out on their own before this readjustment can occur.

Construction

Crafting an Ardoc moilant requires 20,000 pounds of steel smelt with rare compounds costing 7,500 gp. The precise process is jealously guarded by the Ardoc family.
