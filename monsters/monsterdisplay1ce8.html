Special Abilities

Autumnal Embrace (Su) At will, a veranallia can make any creature within 30 feet barren or sterile. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any ability it has to reproduce or bear children. This effect can be removed only by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Creatures that reproduce magically are not affected by this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Bounteous Caster (Su) Once per day, a veranallia can use the Eschew Materials feat to eschew any material component for a spell, regardless of the cost of the material component.

Rebirth (Su) Once per day, a veranallia can reincarnate a willing creature she deems worthy of the honor. The creature's original body decays and sinks into the ground, affecting the surrounding area in a half-mile radius as though with plant growth (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly reincarnated creature inside. Creatures reincarnated by a veranallia always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as per reincarnate (CL 20th).

Spells Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities, and can choose their spells from either the cleric spell list or the druid spell list.

Winter Sickle (Ex) At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a +3 icy burst sickle. One round after it leaves the veranallia's grasp, the weapon melts into a small puddle of water.

Description

Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds.

Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia has a form that combines aspects of a beautiful woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, she instead sprouts countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds.

Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. Veranallias are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush fields or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium, particularly woodlands where the flora changes color almost at random. It is thought the annual tribunals of elder veranallias are actually the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and shifting composition.

At first glance, a veranallia's body appears to be wrapped in foliage, but these vines are actually a part of the azata's strange physiology. She is not subject to blight or similar plants affecting magic, but attempts to use such abilities to hinder her provoke a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's vines can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in a predictable or sensible manner.

Veranallias often prefer the company of other azatas, and often have a following of faithful bralanis or ghaeles. Their volatile natures can make it quite difficult for many other creatures, even other azatas' to be involved with them. For example, lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines' (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 37) belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods.

Veranallia Elder

The most powerful of the veranallias are ancient entities
indeed, beings known as veranallia elders. These veranallias
appear as aged but still beautiful specimens, their upper
human bodies looking like elderly women and their
lower bodies always featuring what seems to be
vegetation in late autumnal colors of red, yellow,
and brown. As a general rule, veranallia elders
have additional Hit Dice and vary in power from
CR 21 to CR 25-they rarely take class levels,
but often have powerful unique abilities
beyond the capability of the standard
veranallia. Two example veranallia elder
powers are presented below.

Mastery of Life (Su): As an immediate
action, the veranallia elder can target any
creature within 60 feet that has been killed
within the last round by a breath of life effect (CL
20th). A creature restored to life by this effect
gains fast healing 20 for 10 rounds.

Create Gate (Su): A veranallia elder is
able to create a gate between Elysium
and the Material Plane once per day,
as per the spell gate, but can do
so only to allow travel between
the two worlds. On the Material
Plane end, the gate must open up
into a wilderness area of natural
beauty. Once created, such
a gate exists until the
veranallia elder is slain or
chooses to end the effect.
A veranallia elder can
maintain up to three
such gates at once; if it
makes a fourth gate, it
chooses which of the
three gates that it
previously
created is
then ended
as a result.

Azatas are a race of celestials native to the plane of Elysium, where the pursuit of freedom and goodness is paramount. Azatas are champions of these concepts, great bards, knights, and explorers who roam the planes in search of good folk in need of their help. Frequently described as the most elven or fey-like celestials, azatas nevertheless often have strange, inhuman shapes or can take elemental or eldritch forms. Most have some knightly or courtly title, such as duke, countess, or prince, apparently hereditary, perhaps from a celestial monarchy long abandoned and forgotten. Azatas do not exploit these titles to exert influence over each other, instead using them for personal identification or a bit of self-importance. They are deadly and resolute foes of evil, fearless and clever in battle.

It is not surprising that the three best-known kinds of azatas can all fly, for they rarely stay in one place for long and prefer the thrill of motion and discovery to creature comforts. Most azata "settlements" are little more than a collection of tents around a landmark, gathered over the course of a day to share news, stories, and perhaps good-natured duels, and then packed up again a few days later. Such temporary settlements are colorful and have a celebratory atmosphere, as azatas are quick to greet any of their kind as old friends. Although few can predict when and where an azata community might arise, some groups or breeds of azatas gather in cycles for traditional festivals and reunions. Such gatherings typically take place at a time of mystical consequence, such as on the evening of the lunar equinox, or during less predictable times, such as upon the wedding of two seers, and always in a place of pristine or stunning natural wonder. All azatas fundamentally know when and where the closest or next gathering of their people might occur, and while none are required or even expected to attend, all are welcome. These gatherings do not preclude more permanent azata holdings and communes, however, and the heights of Elysium endlessly ring with the songs of azata choirs.

While the stoic, homebound archons call their cousins flighty, azatas are driven by a crusading nature and feel bored when forced to stay in one place too long. This tendency also means they are unlikely to agree to serve mortals for an extended period of time, preferring to arrive, get the job done, and move on to some other quest or challenge. As much as they seek to spread the cause of freedom and joy, azatas realize that they cannot enforce such virtues throughout the multiverse. Without darkness there can be no light, and without struggle there can be no victory. Understanding this, these celestials remain removed from the majority of mortal conflicts, preferring to act as advisors in such situations rather than champions, granting goodly mortals ownership over their own triumphs. In cases where the forces of evil act overtly, however, and intrude upon mortal worlds, azatas are quick to rally to defend such realms and aid those who have no hope of defending themselves.

Azatas generally work together, but their powerful personalities and strong sense of individual freedom often see them disagreeing on how best to handle a particular situation. While both parties have the greater good at heart, these arguments can fester and grow into long-lasting grudges. In cases where a single azata is convinced his way is right, he might even enter a sort of self-imposed exile, abandoning the support of his kin so he can launch a one-azata crusade against the cruelties of the multiverse.

Most azatas originate from the untamable beauty of Elysium, created and nourished by the influx of goodly mortal souls. Like most other outsiders, they cannot reproduce with each other in the mortal fashion, and often tryst with mortals who prove charming and good spirited. Azatas dally frequently with their own kind, being quick to seek out feelings of love, joy, and companionship, but rarely feel bound or exclusive to merely one lover, regardless of its race.

Azatas speak Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal, but can speak with almost any creature because of their truespeech special ability. See creature subtypes for full details on truespeech and other shared azata traits.
