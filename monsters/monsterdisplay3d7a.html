Description

Many fire giant queens rule their tribes alongside their husbands, whom they wed for life in marriages based on political power rather than romance. Other fire giant queens reign alone, bowing to no king and needing no partner to supplement their own considerable strength and power.

This lumbering giant has short stumpy legs and powerful, muscular arms. Its hair and beard seem to be made of fire.
