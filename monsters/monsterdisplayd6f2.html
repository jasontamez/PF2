Rajbut Ambari - Monsters







Rajbut Ambari

Standing motionless, this creature could easily be mistaken for a huge skeletal display of a long-dead war elephant. At further glance, its eyes burn a smoky black and pieces of stench-ridden flesh hang from crusty bones. Rusty barding drapes loosely over its skeletal spine, and ancient, rotten finery hangs over its skull and drapes flaccidly toward the ground.

Special Abilities

Trample (Ex) Reflex half DC 26. The save DC is Strength-based.

War Stomp (Su) Rajput ambaris are trained to slam their skeletal front feet hard into the earth, creating a small shockwave that can knock nearby opponents prone. Any opponent standing immediately adjacent to a rajput ambari when it uses this ability must make a DC 25 Reflex save or be knocked prone. War stomp is a full-round action. The save DC is Strength-based.

Undead Servitor Rajput ambaris are completely subservient to their creators and any other creature capable of commanding undead. A rajput ambari is treated as an undead creature of half its Hit Dice for the purposes of being commanded and when counting the total Hit Dice of undead an evil cleric has under his control.

A rajput ambari always understands the language of its master and anyone controlling it.

Carrying Capacity: A light load for a rajput ambari is up to 1,836 pounds; a medium load, 1,837-3,678 pounds; and a heavy load, 3,679-5,520 pounds. A rajput ambari can drag 27,600 pounds.

Description

Horrors born from the depths of Vudra's endless jungles, rajput ambari are undead elephants granted terrible powers through necromantic rites. Massive and terrifying, many of these earth-shaking undead behemoths retain the exotic trappings and elegant finery of the Vudrani princes who once doted upon them. The glory of such beasts is long forgotten, though, as most serve as unholy slaves and fearless beasts of war for uncaring necromancers and deathless masters.

Creating a Rajput Ambari

A spellcaster of 18th level or higher can create a rajput ambari utilizing the create undead spell. In addition to the usual components required by the spell, though, the rite to animate a rajput ambari requires the full skeleton of an adult elephant and adornment of a regal bearing. At the very least, these additions add 400 gp to the spell's total cost.
