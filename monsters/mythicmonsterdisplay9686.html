Special Abilities

Change Shape (Su) A shen can assume the shape of a
pheasant, a shellfish, or a swallow at will, as beast shape III.

Cloud Breath (Su) When a shen uses its lingering breath ability,
the breath leaves a cloud of fog similar to the spell obscuring
mist. This cloud dissipates when the lingering breath ends.

Dragon Attacks (Ex) A shen has all the natural attacks of a
true dragon of its size as well as a gore attack,
which functions as a true dragon's bite attack.

Gaseous Form (Su) A shen can assume gaseous form (as per
the spell), at will and remain in this form indefinitely. It has a
fly speed of 120 feet (perfect) while in gaseous form.

Mirage Castle (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a shen can
fabricate an illusory castle at will, as per mirage arcana (20thlevel
caster), but affecting 10 times as much volume. The shen
doesn't need to concentrate to maintain its creation. The mirage
castle lasts until it's dismissed by the shen as a free action or
until the shen creates another. As a swift action, the shen can
change the details of an existing mirage castle. By expending
one use of mythic power, the shen can make the illusion quasi-real
for 24 hours, as if it the castle were a shadow conjuration
that functioned as 90% real on a successful Will save.

Mists of Madness (Su) A shen can expend one use of mythic
power as a free action when making a breath weapon attack
to infuse it with madness. Creatures within the area of the
breath weapon must succeed a DC 30 Will saving throw or
become confused for as long as they stay within the breath
weapon's cloud and 1d4 rounds after leaving it. This is a mind-affecting
effect and its save DC is Charisma-based.

Pearl Soul (Su) By expending one use of mythic power as
a standard action, or automatically at no cost anytime it
is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, the shen assumes
the shape of a pearl. The shen retains awareness of its
environment, but otherwise is treated as if it had the petrified
condition. The shen's pearl form cannot be damaged in any
way or affected by most spells or abilities, but the shen
can be forced to return to dragon form by a miracle or wish
spell. While in its pearl form, the shen heals naturally, and it
automatically returns to its dragon form when it is fully healed.

Description

Shen are mysterious and aloof dragons, more potent and
enigmatic than their imperial dragon cousins. A shen is
rarely found in its true form, preferring to appear as a
bird, a shellfish, or even a pearl. Its true form is that of
an enormous serpentine dragon, adorned with green and
gold glistening scales. A shen is a creature in constant
motion, as it writhes and wiggles its long body into a
pattern of scintillating twirls and intricate knots.

Typically benevolent, shen have been known to answer
prayers for rain when the gods turn a deaf ear and even to
herd fish into the nets of needy fisherfolk. These proud
creatures can become capricious and even petty, however,
when they believe they have been slighted or treated
with disrespect. Such transgressions can seem random:
eating a swallow (a shen's favorite food), trespassing in a
shen's hunting grounds on special ceremonial days, and
committing acts of petty vandalism can all draw a shen's
wrath. For this reason, some philosophers suggest shen
are creatures of balance seeking to maintain the natural
order. They bring about an early thaw to a harsh winter
or destroy creatures preying on local villages to return
everything to a state of balance. Regardless of what their
motivations are, most people fear and respect them.
More often than not, unusual good or bad fortune
is attributed to shen.

While they are physically mighty, shen are most
feared and respected for the impressive magic
they wield. They are powerful illusionists
and manipulators of weather and climate.

Shen prefer quiet contemplation amid
oceans or other large bodies of water; more
rarely, they can be found in large rivers. While
they need to eat very little, shen enjoy dining
on small amounts of fish and fowl. When
taking their revenge for some small slight,
they eat livestock and freeze crops, but
they are not typically compelled to engage
in such feasts or in wanton destruction.

Shen can transform into great pearls and
frequently do so instead of sleeping. A shen
might turn into a pearl for years or
decades before emerging again into
the natural world.

As with most dragons, shen
accumulate great hoards of treasure,
most often from offerings given as thanks for some
great deed, but also plunder from those who have
angered them or monsters they have vanquished. In
spite of their otherwise gregarious nature, a shen is
unforgiving of creatures that steal or even disturb
its treasure and goes to great lengths to restore even
trivial items removed from its hoard.

To protect their treasures, shen create immense
mirage castles on or in the bodies of water they call
home. These castles are often huge, encompassing
dozens of empty rooms bedecked in illusory silks and
gold, opulent dining halls outf itted with phantasmal
furniture, and massive antechambers illuminated by
simulated chandeliers. No one understands exactly why
these creatures choose to model their mirage homes after
human dwellings, and often the surface resemblance
only serves to further confuse and befuddle visitors.

Despite being solitary creatures, shen socialize more
often than many other types of dragons, and on occasion
conspire along with fellow shen to accomplish some great
task or deed. Though such groups rarely interfere with
the more ephemeral races, they are known to show pity in
times of great need and have delivered much needed rains
during drought or rid the areas neighboring their homes
of some particularly bothersome creatures. Because of
this and out of fear for the great beasts, local peoples give
shen considerable reverence, and pay the dragons tribute
with sacrifices or treasure.
