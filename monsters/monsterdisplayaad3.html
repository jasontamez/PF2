Coeurl - Monsters







Coeurl

Powerfully corded muscles ripple beneath the ebon flesh of this strange, sleek feline. Similar in shape to an oversized panther, the lean beast's forelegs stretch farther than those to the rear, each ending in powerful claws. Rather than ears, curling tendrils flit at the sides of its head. Most distinctive, though, are the twin tentacles rising from the beast's shoulders, powerful appendages that slice through the air like living whips and terminate in clusters of thin spines.

Special Abilities

Blindsense (Ex) A coeurl can locate creatures within 60 feet by nonvisual means (mostly by noticing vibrations and other environmental clues). Opponents the coeurl can't actually see still have total concealment against the coeurl.

Rend (Ex) If a coeurl hits with both tentacle attacks, it latches onto the opponent's body and tears the flesh. This attack automatically deals an additional 2d6+9 points of damage.

Rust (Ex) A coeurl that holds its tentacle in contact with metal for a full minute causes the target metal to corrode, falling to pieces and becoming useless immediately. The touch can destroy two metal objects or up to a 10-foot-cube of metal per minute. Magic armor and weapons, and other magic items made of metal, must succeed on a DC 19 Reflex save or be dissolved. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Vibration Manipulation (Ex) A coeurl can manipulate vibrations to disrupt the workings of machines and constructs. At will, a coeurl can lock or unlock any non-magical locking mechanisim within 15 feet. Once per round, it can also attempt a Disable Device check on any mechanical device within 15 feet. A coeurl always knows whether or not its Disable Device check has succeeded. In addition, a coeurl's tentacle attacks deal an additional +2d6 points of sonic damage to constructs. None of this ability's aspects function while a coeurl is within an area of magical silence.

Description

Lean and deadly, the animalistic appearance of the alien coeurls belies a keen intelligence and the tempered patience of a masterful hunter. Although similar in form to a wiry jungle cat, coeurls' forelegs are longer than their rear, giving the shadowy-skinned, hairless creatures a more elevated posture than a common feline. Rather than ears, bundles of wavering antennae extend from either side of their heads, delicate organs capable of detecting sounds and other, more enigmatic sensations. A coeurl's most distinguishing trait is the pair of powerful black tentacles that extend from its shoulders, each ending in a cluster of flexible, barb-like digits capable of manipulating objects just as nimbly as a human hand.

A typical coeurl stands approximately 3-1/2 feet tall and about 8 feet long, with a densely muscled body weighing around 650 pounds.
