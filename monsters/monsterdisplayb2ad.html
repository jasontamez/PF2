Special Abilities

Anchored (Ex) As a full-round action, a coffin anemone can affix itself to a solid surface. While anchored, it cannot move and gains a +4 bonus to its CMD against bull rush, drag, overrun, and reposition combat maneuvers. This bonus increases by 4 for each size category larger the sea anemone is compared to the opponent. It can unanchor as a full-round action.

Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 1 save.

Sightless (Ex) A coffin anemone is blind and thus unaffected by effects that rely on sight, such as blindness or gaze attacks.

Description

Named for its distinctive oblong shape, the coffin anemone is well-suited to swallow its favored prey: swimming humanoid creatures.
