Lawgiver - Monsters







Herald, Lawgiver

The titanic golden statue of a great knight looms here, four times taller than even the most intimidating warrior. Bearing a gigantic hammer almost too large for it to hold, the sculpture depicts thick, rigid armor, but no details beneath, hiding the identity of the wearer. Upon its breast gleams a golden relief of runes, a key, and a shining city.

Special Abilities

All Around Vision (Su) The Lawgiver is aware of everything around it at all times, providing it with a +4 racial bonus on Spot and Search checks. The Lawgiver cannot be flanked.

Freeze (Ex) The Lawgiver can hold itself so still it appears to be a gigantic, golden statue. An observer must succeed on a DC 25 Spot check to notice the Lawgiver is really alive.

Gavel of Abadar The Gavel of Abadar is a Gargantuan warhammer that is treated as though it had the axiomatic weapon quality. Aside from dealing the usual +2d6 points of damage to creatures of chaotic alignment, three times per day, as a standard action, the Lawgiver can touch a creature with the hammer. Any creature touched in this way is affected by the spells cure serious wounds, neutralize poison, remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, remove disease, and remove paralysis, as if cast by an 18th-level cleric. If the Gavel of Abadar is ever removed from the Lawgiver's hands, the herald can summon the weapon back to its hand as a standard action.

Golden Body (Ex) The Lawgiver is a creature of living gold and blessed steel, granting it immunity to acid, electricity, critical hits, and rusting effects (such as the rusting grasp spell or a rust monster's rust attack).

Herald of Abadar (Su) The Lawgiver can be summoned by clerics of Abadar using the spell gate or greater planar ally, despite any restrictions of those spells.

See in Darkness (Su) The Lawgiver can see in darkness of any kind, even that created by spells like deeper darkness.

Wings of Abadar (Su) As a free action, the Lawgiver can manifest a pair of gigantic golden wings. These wings grant the herald a flight speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability. The Lawgiver can dismiss its wings at will. Alternatively, as a standard action, the Lawgiver can take the form a two-headed golden eagle, one of Abadar's many symbols. The Lawgiver retains its normal hit points and bonus on Spot in this form, but otherwise has the same statistics and abilities of an eagle (MM 272).

Description

Abadar's herald is the Lawgiver, a golem-like creature of gold and consecrated steel. Massive and powerful, the divine emissary appears as a 25-foot-tall giant in elaborate golden armor and bearing a titanic warhammer. Standing still, the Lawgiver appears as a fantastic statue crafted in honor of the god of law. When active, its steps shake the earth and the blow of its legendary hammer-the godforged Gavel of Abadar-can shatter castle walls. Stoic, infinitely patient, and entirely dedicated to the Keeper of the First Vault, the Lawgiver is like an intelligent golden volcano: mountainous and indomitable, yet capable of exacting incredible destruction. This sentinel of civilization appears where the forces of chaos threaten to undo the works of lawful communities and hinder progress's inexorable march.

Terse in nature, the herald of Abadar restricts communication to an unusual limit. Although the giant can speak several languages, it has only ever been heard speaking in numbers and measurements or-more frequently-in direct quotes from Abadar's holy writings, the Order of Numbers or the Manual of City Building. Encyclopedic in its knowledge of the god of cities's holy texts, this restriction rarely prevents the Lawgiver from making its intentions known.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
