Drawn to the raw might and power of nature, a druid creature gains the ability to change shape and cast druid spells. A druid creature's CR increases by 2 if the creature has 7 or more HD, and it increases by 3 if the creature has 13 or more HD.

Quick Rules: +2 on all rolls based on Wis; can use wild shape- if it has 7 or more HD (using its HD - 3 as its druid level to determine the effect of the wild shape); can cast a small number of druid spells (see the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard Spell Slots table above) using its HD as its CL; woodland stride-.

Rebuild Rules: Special Attacks wild shape- (if it has 7 or more HD, using its HD - 3 as its druid level to determine the effect of the wild shape); Druid Spells can cast a small number of druid spells (see the Cleric, Druid, and Wizard Spell Slots table above) using its HD as its CL; Ability Scores +4 Wisdom; SQ woodland stride-.

Animal Companion: These rules assume the druid creature doesn't have an animal companion. If you want to add one, select a creature from the list of a summon nature's ally spell. The spell must have a level no higher than 1/2 the creature's CR. Treat the companion as an additional creature in the encounter, awarding XP for defeating it as if it was not an animal companion.Cleric, Druid, and Wizard Spells Slots<table class="inner"><tr><td>HD</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>1-3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4-6</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7-9</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10-12</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13-15</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16-18</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19-21</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>22-24</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>25+</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr></table>
