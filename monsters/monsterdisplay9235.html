Special Abilities

Devastating Bite (Ex) A hungerer's bite deals x4 damage on
a successful critical hit. If this damage is enough to reduce a
victim to negative hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC
30 Fortitude save to avoid being decapitated, bitten in half, or
otherwise instantly killed by the horrific wound. The save DC
is Strength-based.


Vile Spew (Su) Whenever a hungerer takes damage, the
resulting wound spews a great gout of vile blood and acid.
Any creature adjacent to a hungerer when it is wounded takes
2d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 25 negates). The save
DC is Constitution-based.


Wisdom Drain (Su) A hungerer drains 2 points of Wisdom each
time it strikes a foe with its bite or claw attacks. Unlike with
other kinds of ability drain attacks, a hungerer does not heal
any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.


Description

Once regular lamias, these hideously deformed creatures are the result of terrible f leshwarping experiments that have rarely been repeated since the fall of Thassilon. The heads and torsos of these creatures are nearly 10 feet in diameter, and a typical hungerer weighs about 20,000 pounds.

Hungerers are unnatural creatures, re-released into the world with Karzoug's awakening. These terrors live in constant pain and serve as living embodiments of hunger, insatiable in their constant quests for sustenance. Although they prefer to tear and rend living f lesh, hungerers can consume almost any organic material, and might even gnaw on stone or metal without ill effect when nothing else is available.
