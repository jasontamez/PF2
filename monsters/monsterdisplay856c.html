Symbiote (Ex) See above.

Trench mists are created anywhere that deadly gas attacks
are used for the wholesale slaughter of troops, whether
attacks of a mundane poisonous nature, or from the
magical effects of spells such as acid fog. Under mysterious
circumstances likely born of the horrors of war and the
final throes of young soldiers dying before their time, these
mists linger over the battlefield, absorbing the departing
souls of the slain. This commingling of loosed life energy
and strange chemicals grants the miasma a sly, malevolent
sentience. Once so born, the trench mist then seeks only
to impart misery and share its singular fate with those
fortunate enough to have escaped the poisonous attacks
that birthed the creature in the first place. As it preys upon
the living it absorbs the aff licted into its growing horde of
shambling servants. Victims of its acidic mist rise as hateful
zombies under the creature's control, and a trench mist
that gains a horde of zombies is a dangerous foe indeed. On
battlefields where trench mists are known to have arisen,
wise commanders arrange cease-fires during which both
sides abandon the site, lest their troops succumb to the
horrifying fate of their comrades.


Part of the trench mist's self-awareness comes from the
symbiotic trench zombies it gains as it slaughters its victims,
as the zombies under the mist's control retain the abilities
they had in life as well as some snippets of their former
memories, which all feed into the collective consciousness
of the trench mist. This allows the mist to learn and adapt,
granting it a relatively keen intelligence compared to other
similar creatures, and allowing it to make canny combat
decisions and cleverly manipulate its surroundings.


Trench mists wander battlefields looking for prey so
they can add more shambling zombies to their collective
hordes. Occasionally they might even enter inhabited areas
to seek out fresh ammunition and armaments for those
of their symbiotic undead who may have exhausted their
weaponry. When bereft of such foul company, trench mists
often persist for years after the tides of war have receded,
settling into the soil and slumbering until fresh prey arises.
The lifespan of trench mists is unknown, though through
this sort of hibernation they very well may be immortal,
reemerging without warning at the scenes of ancient battles
centuries after they have taken place, whether turned up by
an unsuspecting farmer's plow or war waged anew.

Trench Zombie


A trench zombie is a rotting creature leaking sulfurous fumes
from beneath its acid-burned, peeling skin, and bristling
with the armaments it possessed in its horrifying death.
Retaining many of the memories and skills it possessed in
life, a trench zombie contributes its intelligence into a sort
of hive mind for the trench mist that originally spawned it,
creating a true symbiosis between the two-a gift the
trench zombie repays upon its destruction, when
the horrific fumes that granted it
unlife go back to the trench mist that
birthed it. Trench zombies are foul
and vengeful, and are canny enough
to lurk within the nurturing
embrace of their mother mist,
which provides them concealment
without impairing their senses.
Those seeking trench zombies-
destruction typically must
enter the engulfing body
of a trench mist if they are
to ward off the zombies-
ranged attacks. Trench
zombies are created using
the juju zombie template
(Bestiary 2 291), but they lose
the juju zombie's immunity to
magic missile, which is replaced
by immunity to acid. Trench
zombies also gain the following
special ability.


Symbiote (Ex) A unique
relationship with trench mists
grants trench zombies immunity
to acid. In addition, when a trench
zombie reaches 0 hit points and is
destroyed, the mustard-colored mist
that animates the creature bursts
violently from its damaged form.
All creatures adjacent to the trench
zombie are exposed to the toxic
gas and take 4d6 points of acid
damage. If the trench zombie is
enveloped within the fog of its parent
trench mist when this death burst occurs, the mist's fast
healing ability increases by 1 for a number of rounds equal
to the Hit Dice of the destroyed trench zombie. The effects
of the deaths of multiple symbiotic trench zombies stack.
