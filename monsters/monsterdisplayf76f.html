Special Abilities

Infest (Ex) A hive larva swarm can enter the body of a single Small or larger helpless living creature. When it does so, a portion of the swarm enters a creature's mouth and gestates for 1d4 minutes. The gestated larvae ravage the host for 24 hours, during which time the infested creature falls unconscious and can't be woken by any means. During this period the larvae are vulnerable to expulsion by remove disease (same DC as death throes, typically DC 16). If successful, the hive larvae die inside of the host, dealing another 1d6 points of acid damage. In some cases, metabolized hive larvae corpses can infect the creature with the hive corruption (see page 24).

After 24 hours, the hive larvae achieve symbiosis. The host awakens feeling healthy but hungry. Spells such as diagnose disease<sup>UM<sup> and Heal checks used to detect disease no longer detect the hive infestation, and the host creature is now treated as both its original creature type and an aberration for purposes of spells and effects (whichever is worse). A successful DC 25 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check can identify the symbiosis. If the host dies at this point, the larval infestation dies as well. However, if the host is then returned from the dead, the larvae are returned to life as well.

The swarm fully matures 2d12 hours after symbiosis. By this point, there is no way to save the host short of a miracle or wish spell. Each round for 2d12 rounds, the host suffers agonizing pain and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 16) or be nauseated for 1 round. On each failed save, the host takes 4d6 points of damage as the mature hive creature forcibly separates itself. At the end of the 2d12 rounds, or after the host is slain by the damage, a fully formed hive creature (usually a hive warrior) explodes from within, destroying the host's body.

Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Strength; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Description

Hive larvae are the first stage of the hive life cycle. These tenacious creatures render suitable hosts incapacitated and infest their bodies, transforming them into new hive creatures.

The hive are an invasive species of aberrations that consume worlds like locusts. Hive creatures have the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Immunity to acid.</li> <li>Blind: A hive creature is blind. It is immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. Unlike other aberrations, a hive creature doesn't have darkvision.</li> <li>Blindsense 60 feet.</li> <li>Blindsight 10 feet.</li> <li>Corrosive Blood (Ex): A hive creature's blood is highly caustic. Every time the hive creature is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes acid damage according to the table below (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the hive creature has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.</li>
<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Size of Hive Creature</td><td>Points of Acid Damage</td></tr> <tr><td>Medium or smaller</td><td>1d4</td></tr> <tr><td>Large</td><td>1d6</td></tr> <tr><td>Huge</td><td>1d8</td></tr> <tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>2d6</td></tr> <tr><td>Colossal</td><td>2d8</td></tr></table>
<li>Death Throes (Ex): When a hive creature dies, it exudes a pool of its corrosive blood in the space it occupies. This pool deals 1d6 points of acid damage per Hit Die of the hive creature for 3 rounds to objects and creatures in those squares (Reflex half ). This acid damages whatever surface it is on, and if it deals enough damage to destroy the surface, the acid falls down to any subsequent floor below and continues to deal damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</li> <li>Heat Adaptability (Ex): Hive creatures are considered to always be under the effect of endure elements with regard to hot climates.</li> <li>Hive Mind (Ex): Hive creatures have no language of their own, instead communicating simple concepts via pheromone discharge and body language that other creatures with the hive subtype understand. This ability functions within line of sight. If one hive creature is able to act in the surprise round of combat, all other hive creatures in line of sight can also act, and a hive creature isn't flanked unless all hive creatures within line of sight are flanked.</li> <li>A hive creature doesn't need to eat, drink, or sleep.</li>
