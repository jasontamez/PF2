Special Abilities

Polar Breach (Su) As a full-round action that does not
provoke attacks of opportunity, a ningen can rapidly
submerge itself beneath the water and then launch itself
upward to break the surface and crash down. The impact
produces flying chunks of ice dealing 10d6 points of
cold damage and 10d6 points of piercing damage to all
creatures and objects within a 30-foot radius. Creatures
that take cold damage are staggered and entangled for
a number of rounds equal to the ningen's Hit Dice, and
those that take piercing damage are sickened for the same
number of rounds. A successful DC 27 Reflex save halves
this damage and negates the staggered effect. The save DC
is Constitution-based.

Description

Colossal but reclusive, ningens inhabit the coldest oceans
of the world, preying on fish and large arctic mammals
like walruses and even whales. A ningen has long
armlike flippers ending in sharp spurs that act as claws,
and a humongous tail that can propel it rapidly through
the water. The creature's body is sheathed in layers of
thick, insulating blubber. Its face is oddly featureless,
with nothing more than a pair of small nostrils, two
large, black eyes, and a thin mouth containing rows of
large teeth.

Although intelligent and capable of communication,
ningens are distrustful of humanoids, particularly those
on seafaring vessels, due to a long history of their kind
being hunted by land dwellers. While the insulating
blubber that allows ningens to exist in the coldest
waters has some of the same uses as whale oil, a ningen's
supernatural link to cold makes its bones, its skin, and
even its teeth valuable to those seeking to craft or enchant
various magic items.

When threatened or angered, ningens make terrifying
opponents. Ningens always attempt to bring enemies
into the water, where they can use their abilities to
greater effect.

A ningen is 90 feet long and weighs 180,000 pounds.
