Inkanyamba - Monsters







Inkanyamba

This monstrous serpent rises to a great height, unfurling an opalescent hood the size of a tower shield. Swaying from side to side, the creature drops open its elongated jaw to reveal an assortment of different-sized fangs. As it hisses, lightning slashes the storm-gray sky behind it.

Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, an inkanyamba can spit a 60-foot line of venom at its foes as a standard action. Any creatures struck must make a DC 23 Reflex save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and be blinded for 1d6 rounds. A successful save halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1 point) and negates the blindness.

Hold Breath (Ex) An inkanyamba can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning or suffocating.

Hypnotic Sway (Su) As a full-round action, an inkanyamba can unfurl its hood and sway back and forth. Any nonmindless creature within 30 feet that views an inkanyamba's hypnotic sway must make a DC 23 Will save or be fascinated for 1d4 rounds. Any attack by the inkanyamba breaks the fascination effect. Any creature that successfully saves or has the fascination effect broken cannot be affected by the same inkanyamba's hypnotic sway for 24 hours.

Poison (Ex) An inkanyamba's body contains a host of different venoms. Once per round as a swift action, it can change which ability score its poison affects.
<br />Vacillating Venom: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds, effect 1d4 ability damage, cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Venomsense (Ex) An inkanyamba that makes physical contact with a living creature through either its bite, tail slap, or constriction ability gains an automatic knowledge of the target's ability scores, allowing the inkanyamba to better use its protean venom on its victims.

Description

Sometimes called elder serpents, inkanyambas are enormous, malevolent snake-like creatures that dwell in tropical lakes and deep jungle rivers. Measuring over 60 feet long and weighing nearly 3,000 pounds, an inkanyamba resembles a dense snake with a vaguely crocodilian head, filled with multiple sets of fangs of varying lengths. Its long body is covered in multicolored scales that range from emerald green to golden and even vermilion. Males have larger hoods than females, who also have small, pointed frills running the length of their bodies.

Inkanyambas live for centuries; their maximum possible lifespan is unknown.
