Description

Undigested are the animate slurry of the indigestible parts
of a humanoid creature. They come into being when a giant
beast that swallowed its prey alive is slain by unspeakable
necromantic arts. A primal shard of the beast's sentience is
ripped from it during the agonizing moments of its death,
animating the gelatinous humanoid remains within its
stomach into an ooze-like undead creature which hungers
to inf lict its digestive fate upon others. If the beast was
digesting multiple creatures, this phenomenon results
in undigested swarms instead. Undigested-implacable
ambush predators'slop, ooze, and undulate through
the dark places of the world in search
of sustenance.
