Black Jinni - Monsters







Black Jinni

This appears to be a powerful humanoid figure, but it is difficult to make out due to the cloud of obscuring dust that perpetually hangs around it. The faint howl of winds and the smell of the deep desert seems to linger in its presence. It has recognizable features such as arms and legs, but they seem somehow wrong and out of proportion.

Special Abilities

Aligned Weapons (Ex) A black jinni's natural weapons and any weapon it wields are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid or genie slain by a black jinni's searing touch rises 1d4 rounds later as an undead spawn. Humanoids rise as zombies; jann rise as ghuls; and djinn, efreet, shaitans, and marids rise as great ghuls. Ghuls and great ghuls are detailed in Pathfinder Chronicles: Dark Markets, A Guide To Katapesh. Spawn created by a black jinni are under its control.

Dust Vortex (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, a black jinni can cause the obscuring cloud that surrounds it to become a vortex of electrically-charged dust. This vortex is 20 feet high and radiates to a range of 30 feet, with the black jinni at the vortex's center. The winds within this area are considered a windstorm, making normal ranged attacks impossible and causing a -4 penalty to siege weapon attacks against creatures in the vortex. Creatures within the vortex are subjected to wind effects as described on page 95 of the DMG-those who are blown back are instead drawn toward the center to a square adjacent to the black jinni. A creature that ends its turn within the dust vortex takes 10d6 points of electricity damage (DC 24 Reflex save halves). Once the dust vortex is created, it remains stationary, allowing the black jinni to move around in it or even leave it. The vortex remains in place for 1d6 rounds, or until the black jinni dismisses it as a move action. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Obscuring Cloud (Ex) A black jinni is continually surrounded by a cloud of obscuring dust and scouring wind. This cloud gives it a +8 racial bonus to its Hide check while within a sandstorm or other area of blowing dust. In addition, a black jinni has concealment (20% miss chance) while the cloud is in effect. Any strong (or stronger) wind can suppress the obscuring cloud as long as the wind persists.

Shocking Touch (Su) Any creature hit by a black jinni's claw attack takes an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage-on a critical hit, this additional electricity damage increases to 2d10 points of damage and the creature must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or the electricity lingers on his body, inflicting an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage each round on the start of the victim's turn for 1d6 additional rounds. Immersion in any liquid ends this ongoing damage, as does contact with a metal object of at least Medium or larger size that is in contact with the ground. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Stormwalk (Ex) A black jinni is able to move about in any storm of natural or unnatural origin of hurricane velocity (75-174 mph wind speed) or less without suffering any of its effects.

Vulnerability to Recitation (Ex) As cursed genies of evil and chaos, black jinn are strangely susceptible to certain recitations of holy tracts belonging to good or lawful deities or philosophies. These include the spells dictum and holy word, but also forceful recitations of nonmagical holy sermonizing. If a cleric or paladin of a lawful or good deity makes a successful opposed Knowledge (religion) check against a black jinni as a standard action, the black jinni must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be instantly destroyed, leaving behind only a small spot of charred ash. If this save is successful, the black jinni instead takes 5d6 points of damage.

Description

Thought by many, even among the jann, to be myths and dark legends, the black jinn are an accursed and forgotten tribe of genies. Bearers of ill will and bringers of destruction upon both mortals and their own kind, these hateful creatures are possessed by madness and a drive to call down ruin upon any who intrude upon their desolate sanctums. The few black jinn encountered on the Material Plane are thought of as terrors of the deep desert, arriving in sudden sandstorms, brilliant with electrical fury, and disappearing just as quickly to leave behind no trace of lost comrades, or merely leaving corpses, charred or glazed in molten glass. Largely, black jinn are creatures of myth and legend, but a handful of mortals know the terrible truth which few live long enough to tell.

Although typically surrounded by a cloud of dust, black jinn appear more fiendish than other genies. A cursed creature, they do not constitute a true race of jann, but rather a bloodline so corrupt as to no longer be considered part of this proud race. A black jinni stands 12 feet tall and can weigh as much 1,200 pounds, its body being mostly comprised of soot, dust, and foul smoke.
