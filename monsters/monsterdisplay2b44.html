Description

Although nocturnal, the fire beetle lacks darkvision-it relies on its own glowing glands for illumination. Caged fire beetles are a popular source of long-lasting illumination among eccentrics and miners.

Other variations on the common fire beetle exist. The two most common variants are detailed below.

Mining Beetle (CR 1/2): A mining beetle is an advanced fire beetle with the advanced simple template and a burrowing speed of 20 feet.

Flash Beetle (CR 1/2): A flash beetle is an advanced fire beetle that can create a bright flash of light once an hour. When a flash beetle does so, all creatures in a 10-foot burst must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.
