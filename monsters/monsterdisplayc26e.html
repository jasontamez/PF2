Special Abilities

Cemented Mind (Ex) A soulbound shell can never change its known or prepared spells.

Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the shell lives within a gem inside its chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another shell, at the same cost as creating a new soulbound shell, and retains its personality and memories. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.

Spells (Sp) A spellbound shell casts spells as a 12th-level cleric, witch, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities.

Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) A soulbound shell is not immune to mind-affecting effects.

Description

A soulbound shell is the perfected version of a soulbound mannequin, allowing the soul to retain its spellcasting.

Construction

A soulbound shell is constructed from marble, a 5,000 gp gem for the soul focus, and the soul of a willing spellcaster of at least 12th level who dies at the culmination of the creation process and animates the stone shell.
