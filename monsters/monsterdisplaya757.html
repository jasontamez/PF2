Tooth Fairy Monarch - Monsters







Tooth Fairy, Tooth Fairy Monarch

Resembling a gaunt humanoid from the waist up and a fleshy insect from the waist down, this child-sized creature has enormous black eyes and a large jaw with a lolling tongue. It wears a crown made of humanoid teeth and clutches a tooth-studded scepter.

Special Abilities

Death Throes (Su) When a tooth fairy monarch is slain, it explodes into a cloud of chattering, biting motes that deals 3d6 points of piercing damage to all creatures within a 10-foot-radius burst and imparts the dazzled condition to them for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 14 Fortitude save takes half this damage and is dazzled for 1 round. A tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed by this explosion, but its other gear is unaffected. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Scepter (Su) Each tooth fairy monarch owns a heavy scepter of wood, scrap metal, and twine. In the hands of a tooth fairy monarch, the scepter functions as a +1 morningstar. Any loose tooth the tooth fairy monarch touches to the scepter remains firmly adhered to it, requiring a successful DC 25 Strength check to remove, although a tooth fairy monarch can pluck a tooth from its scepter automatically with its tooth eater ability. The scepter has hardness 10 and 15 hit points. If a tooth fairy monarch's scepter is destroyed, all attached teeth fall free and the tooth fairy monarch is staggered until it can create another one, which requires 1 hour of work and a small amount of junk. Although a scepter can hold dozens of teeth, a tooth fairy monarch usually has only 1d6 teeth attached to its scepter when encountered.

Tooth Eater (Su) Using its sinuous tongue, a tooth fairy monarch can grab and consume an unattached tooth within 5 feet as a move action, so long as the tooth is unattended or in its possession (such as attached to its scepter). The tooth fairy monarch regains a number of hit points equal to its Hit Dice (5 hit points for most tooth fairy monarchs), gains nourishment as though it had eaten a full meal, and recovers the use of one of its expended daily spell-like abilities of its choice (if any).

Description

The rare and reclusive leaders of clans of <a href="monsterdisplaya8b8.html?ItemName=Tooth%20Fairy">tooth fairies</a>, tooth fairy monarchs rule their smaller, lesser kin with imperious commands and domineering bluster. These monarchs collect the teeth pulled by the lesser tooth fairies as tribute, affixing the teeth to their magical scepters or forming them into simple jewelry such as crowns, bracelets, or necklaces. A monarch can consume these teeth to gain a burst of supernatural nourishment. They find teeth of large, powerful creatures to be tastier than those of children or smaller creatures (such as other tooth fairies), but they will command their tooth fairy minions to offer up their own teeth for consumption as punishment for failure, or simply to remind onlookers of their authority.

In combat, a tooth fairy monarch prefers to hold back behind a screen of tooth fairies, exhorting their minions to attack. Monarchs use their spell-like abilities to distract and debilitate foes while directing their minions to pull their enemies' teeth. Tooth fairies bring these teeth to the monarch, even in the middle of a fight, so the monarch can consume them on the spot or stick them to their scepters for later consumption. Fundamentally cowardly, a tooth fairy monarch encountered on its own usually attempts to flee using lies or magical trickery.

A tooth fairy monarch stands 3 feet high and weighs about 30 pounds.

Ecology

Tooth fairy monarchs claim to know secret rituals to elevate common tooth fairies to their own royal stature. They dangle this possibility in front of their dim-witted subjects to compel adoration and loyalty, but the truth is much simpler than the monarchs would like their minions to realize: a tooth fairy that consumes an excessive amount of humanoid teeth-several dozen in a single sitting-might enter a magically induced lethargy and fall asleep. While the tooth fairy is sleeping, a cocoon develops around it and, in about a month, the creature emerges as a tooth fairy monarch. To prevent common tooth fairies from learning the true nature of this transformation, monarchs insist that tooth fairies bring them the teeth they collect, which the monarch hoards. If the monarch hears of a strange cocoon forming within a tooth fairy's lair, he insists on having the cocoon incinerated. Not only does this extreme measure prevent a new tooth fairy monarch from emerging; it also serves to silence any suspicions about where the cocoon came from.

Tooth fairy monarchs appear to be large tooth fairies from the waist up, but their lower halves resemble a fleshy beetle or cockroach. The membranous wings protruding from their backs appear comically small, but they are powerful enough to sustain the creature in flight. Tooth fairy monarchs produce paralytic saliva but rarely bite their enemies, as they prefer to remain at a safe distance from foes.

Tooth fairy monarchs might survive for many decades, but the rough and violent life of squabbling tooth fairy clans means few survive more than 20 or 30 years. A tooth fairy monarch that isn't violently overthrown by its own minions, assassinated by a rival monarch, or slain by humanoids grows increasingly fat. While its torso expands, its limbs shrivel, leaving only a ball-shaped head over a quivering mass of flesh. Eventually unable to feed itself, much less defend itself, an old tooth fairy monarch is easy prey for rivals.

Habitat and Society

A tooth fairy monarch is rarely encountered without an entourage of several tooth fairies. These attendants serve the monarch diligently, although their attitudes range from genuine respect and adoration to ill-concealed disdain. Outright rebellion against a monarch is rare, however, as tooth fairy monarchs are powerful enough to bully lesser tooth fairies into compliance and frequently punish disloyal minions by removing and consuming all of their teeth in front of them.

Tooth fairy monarchs live in unused basements, abandoned farms, or other isolated locales that are near humanoid settlements but out of the way of casual observation. Here, tooth fairy monarchs set up their courts, building makeshift throne rooms from scraps discarded by humanoid society. Tooth fairy monarchs often have several minor magic items in their lairs, as many can activate or even create magic items with a casual skill that is the envy of humanoid spellcasters.

Tooth fairy monarchs are willing to stand up to nearly any creature with imperious bluster. The sole exceptions to their bravado are cats. Even a tiny kitten causes quivering terror in tooth fairy monarchs, and they insist that their attendants chase away such creatures. Most tooth fairy monarchs will abandon all their "wealth"- including their hoards of carefully collected teeth-rather than share a lair with a cat.
