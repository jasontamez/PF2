Special Abilities

Expeditious Calculation (Su) Three times per day, as a swift action a rokyamut can attempt to use any of its spell-like abilities with the lawful descriptor. To do so, it must succeed at a Knowledge (engineering) check with a DC equal to 20 plus twice the spell's level. On a failure, the casting is lost and the rokyamut is dazed for 1 round.

Prudent Positioning (Ex) Three times per day as an immediate action, a rokyamut can position itself precisely to avoid danger. This allows the rokyamut to either treat the result of a Reflex save as though it had rolled a natural 20 or automatically avoid a single attack of opportunity it provokes.

Symbological Attack (Su) A rokyamut can conjure a two-dimensional mathematical symbol of rigid perfection into one or more of its hands as a free action. When attacking with these symbols, the rokyamut slices through unliving matter. These symbols act as +2 brilliant energy starknives, except they can harm undead and constructs (but not objects). While fighting with its symbols, a rokyamut gains Two-Weapon Fighting as a bonus feat. A symbol disappears 1 round after it leaves a rokyamut's grasp.

Unrelenting Geometry (Su) A rokyamut's presence creates a stabilizing effect that impairs folds in space. Teleportation spells and spell-like abilities automatically fail if they begin or end within 300 feet of a rokyamut, even if the effect is created by the rokyamut itself. Creatures within this aura can't benefit from any miss chance due to shuffling between states of reality, such as that provided by blink.

Description

Rokyamuts are rigid defenders of mathematical laws and geometric truths, seeking out those who would bend space or subvert the rules of reality. Their targets are primarily aberrant aliens, plane-twisting outsiders, and cosmic calamities, but they oppose any creatures that view the immutable laws of physics as suggestions rather than rules. Rokyamuts are juggernauts of stability found in the warped places of the multiverse.

Rokyamuts have a thick, armored chassis that resembles an elephant from the waist down. Four powerful arms protrude from their barrel-chested torsos, two on each side. Their heads are capped with bare steel. Complex and delicate clockworks are visible in openings at their joints. A halo of glowing symbols floats around a rokyamut's head, expressing mathematical functions in a dizzying array of languages and computational systems. Rokyamuts can conjure similar symbols into their hands to use as weapons, fighting with calculated precision. Although these blades are effective against nearly any foe, rokyamuts can sense the presence of lawful creatures instinctively and rarely target them unless provoked.

Like other inevitables, rokyamuts aren't born and are instead crafted by the axiomites of Axis as directed by the Godmind or the primal inevitables. Rokyamuts are commissioned in response to aberrant misuse of mathematics or geometry-altering cosmic phenomena.

Rokyamuts often work alone, although they coordinate with others of their kind efficiently to combat serious threats. Over long years of pursuing multiple missions, rokyamuts generally fall into one of two categories: planar custodians or cosmic stabilizers.

Rokyamuts working as planar custodians have long experience on planes with unusual geometry or loose physical laws, such as the Maelstrom or the First World. They work to bring consistency to these realms by finding and destroying sources of reality-warping magic. These rokyamuts are often more diplomatic in nature, and they have a critical eye for weighing risk and reward. Lhaksharuts often aid these rokyamuts in their efforts, as lhaksharuts' work in closing down unstable planar breaches is made easier when the laws of reality are, even temporarily, forced into well-behaved stability.

Rokyamuts working as cosmic stabilizers often operate alone to explore the depths of space on the Material Plane in order to confront dangerous aliens or rogue cosmic phenomena. These rokyamuts make plans on truly enormous scales, such as crashing a planetoid into a pending solar flare to prevent a severe gravitational event. They are often knowledgeable about the Great Old Ones and the Dominion of the Black, as their missions take them into conflict with these entities on a regular basis. Cosmic stabilizers are often surly and untrusting, and see their missions in stark black-and-white terms. Few creatures consider these rokyamuts pleasant company, and fewer still intentionally draw their single-minded ire.

A rokyamut is 65 feet tall and weighs 200 tons.

Originally invented and forged in the Outer Planes by the axiomites, inevitables are living machines whose sole purpose is to seek out and destroy agents of chaos wherever they can.

During the height of the first war between law and chaos, while the Outer Planes were still forming from the raw chaos of the primal reality, inevitables were constructed by the axiomites as an unflinching army'soldiers powerful and devoted enough to march on the madness-inducing hordes of proteans who sought to unmake reality and return it all to the primal chaos they so adored. While this war has long since cooled to a simmer, and the reality of the Outer Planes is now not so easily threatened by the entropic influence of the proteans and their home plane, the defense of the axiomites' home plane remains the inevitables' primary goal. Despite the proteans' subsequent adaptation and study of how best to make themselves more resistant to the inevitables' attacks, these constructed soldiers remain imposingly effective.

Today, many inevitables-almost all of those encountered on the Material Plane-pursue a new aspect of their original mission: tracking down those who flagrantly flout the forces of law and redeeming them or, more often, eliminating the threat they present to the ordered nature of the multiverse. Matched on the side of chaos by the manipulative imentesh proteans, new inevitables awake to find themselves locked in a proxy war, knowing that losing the Material Plane to chaos would place their masters in a dangerous position.

Genderless, incorruptible, and caring nothing for power or personal advancement, inevitables are cunning and valiant shock troops in the service of law. Though they regularly interact with their creator race on their home plane, they have no society of their own, and are almost always encountered singly on other planes, each more than capable of pursuing its own mission. These individual crusades range from enforcing important or high-profile contracts and laws to forcibly correcting those mortals who would seek to cheat death. How they deal with the guilty varies according to the transgression: sometimes this means a simple geas or mark of justice to ensure that the target works to right his wrongs or never again strays from the path of law, but just as often an offense worthy of an inevitable's attention is severe enough that only immediate execution will suffice. Such decisions are not always popular-for the kindly priest who transcends mortality and the freedom fighter who battles the evil-yet-rightful king are every bit as guilty as grave-robbing necromancers and demon-worshipers-but the inevitables are always just, and few dare stand in the way of their judgment. Those inevitables who have completed a given mission often wander through whatever society they find themselves in, seeking other lawbreakers worthy of their ministrations. Brave souls with a worthy cause are always welcome to approach an inevitable and present their case, but should be wary of invoking the help of such powerful, single-minded beings-for an inevitable may not see the situation the same way they do, and though all inevitables do their best to preserve innocent life, they're not above sacrificing a few allies or innocents in an effort to bring down a greater villain.

Physically, inevitables often have humanoid forms or aspects, but their bodies appear somewhere between clockwork constructs and fine statues in the greatest classical tradition. Constructed of stone, adamantine, and even more precious materials, each inevitable is brought to sentience in the axiomites' forges already programmed with the details of its first target. Though they know that all beings outside of the lawful planes harbor chaos in their hearts, inevitables also understand that such conflicted creatures may yet be forces for law as much as for chaos, and thus overlook all but the most flagrant offenses. The most commonly recognized types of inevitables are as follows.

Arbiters: Scouts and diplomats, often assigned to wizards as familiars in the hopes of directing such individuals to the cause of law.

Kolyaruts: Cloaked and stealthy humanoid warriors who track and punish those who break contracts.

Lhaksharuts: Juggernauts who search for permanent breaches and links between planes and invasions from one dimension to another.

Maruts: Towering beings of stone, steel, and storm who bring a fitting end to those mortals who try to cheat death in attempts to live forever.

Zelekhuts: Winged, centaur-like constructs who track down those who flee just and legal punishment, returning them to their rightful judges or carrying out the sentence themselves.

Primal Inevitables

While the lhaksharuts are generally thought of as the most powerful caste of inevitable, there exist others of even greater skill and strength-these are known as the primal inevitables. These goliaths were among the first weapons of war forged by the axiomites to fight the protean menace-the methods to create more have long been lost to the axiomites, and those few primals who remain alive to this day have become legendary. None have been encountered in living memory, but the possibility of a primal's emergence is enough to give the proteans second thoughts when ideas of invading the inevitables' home plane arise.
