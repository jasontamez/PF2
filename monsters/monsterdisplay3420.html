Cabal Devil (Uniila) - Monsters







Devil, Cabal Devil (Uniila)

The curves of a shapely maiden define the outline of a mysterious figure wrapped in mist and strips of ancient robes. From beneath the rune-embroidered tatters stretch four, corpse-pale arms, each bearing either a blade or some mysterious arcane device. Hidden within the cowl of its hood shimmer the faintest outlines of a veiled face and a pair of eyes flickering with barely restrained energy.

Special Abilities

Dread Magic (Su) All spells an uniila casts draw upon terrible infernal eddies and the torment of damned souls. As such, all of an uniila's spells (not her spell-like abilities) are strange and terrible to behold. This increases the Spellcraft DC required to identify an uniila's spell as it is being cast by +5. In addition, at will, an uniila can choose to make a spell she casts particularly frightening. Any creature forced to make a saving throw to resist a spell cast by an uniila must make an additional Will save at the same DC or be shaken for 1 round. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Infernal Arcana (Su) Once per day, after spending a minute whispering strange formulas and cosmic truths, an uniila can grant an adjacent mortal spellcaster additional profane insight into the ways of magic. This counts as a bonus spell prepared or spell per day of 6th level or lower, which is immediately accessible by the target in addition to all its regular spells. The uniila chooses what spell to grant the target. It need not be a spell already known by the target, though it must be of 6th level or lower and of a level he can cast or from his class's spell list. This spell remains available to the target for 24 hours. The spell can be any arcane or divine spell. An uniila can never use this ability on herself or non-mortal targets.
<br />Once a target chooses to make use of this spell, it is cast at the uniila's caster level (typically 8th) and is treated as having the evil subtype. In addition, as the uniila chooses, she may spontaneously add the effects of any metamagic feat to the spell (without the spell being treated as though it were of an increased spell level). Typically, uniilas use this ability to compel magic users to rely on them for more powerful magic, though they might also use effects like Widen Spell to affect unintended targets.

Scroll Mastery (Su) All uniilas possess Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. An uniila is treated as knowing all spells of 6th level or lower in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and can create scrolls of any of those spells. Whether an uniila knows rarer magic is decided by the GM.

Summon Devil (Su) Once per day, an uniila can attempt to summon 2d4 imps with a 55% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.

Witch Token (Su) By spending an hour in concentration, an uniila can create a token of arcane power. This token may take any form that takes up an item slot, and typically appears as a subtly fiendish ring, amulet, or similar piece of jewelry. While it is worn by a mortal, all of the DCs of any spells the wearer casts increase by +1 (this effect stacks with Spell Focus). However, while wearing a witch token, the bearer takes a -5 penalty on all saves made to resist spells and effects cast by the token's creation. Also, while the token is being worn, the uniila can effectively scry through the token at will and without the wearer's knowledge as long as he remains on the same plane. Spells and effects that typically bar or confound scry also affect the witch token.
<br />As a standard action, an uniila can cause her witch token to erupt in a burst of destructive magic that deals 10d6 points of damage to the wearer. An uniila can only ever have one witch token in existence at a time and must destroy a previously created token before creating a new one. The damage of this effect is based on the uniila's Hit Dice.
<br />All witch tokens are also under effects similar to magic aura, and are detected as possessing auras of moderate universal magic. Those who use identify or a similar spell must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to receive correct information (that the token sheds an aura of strong divination). Detect evil reveals no aura from a witch token. The saving throw is Charisma-based.

Description

The tools devils use to ensnare the minds and ultimately the souls of their victims vary incredibly, from the most blatant of infernal corruptions to enticements that seem not like temptations at all. The elusive cabal devils, or uniilas as they are known by diabolists, employ one of the most seductive drugs in existence in their snares: magic. Mistresses of the arcane with an understanding of the cultic arts-both arcane and divine-that rivals even that of many greater fiends, these mysterious and aloof sages haunt the most ancient ruins and moldering depths of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, researching arcana and puzzling over formulae destined to shake the cosmos. When conjured forth or left to their own devices upon the Material Plane, uniilas make no untoward offers or forceful demands of their mortal hosts; they merely offer greater magical power in any of the various ways they might do so. Should the ease with which such might is granted pollute a mortal's ambitions or lead him to rely upon a devil for his power, such ultimately proves the student's fault, not the eager teacher's. So too does the resulting damnation at the end of the mortal's short life prove more of his own doing than any overt diabolical trap, making uniilas' methods all the more sinister for their subtlety.

Summoning Cabal Devils

Uniilas eagerly seek passage to the Material Plane and as such welcome summons by mortal casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove inscrutable and of secondary interest to a summoner. Tempering their desire to reach the mortal plane, an uniila's vanity prevents it from serving a witless or hopeless summoner. Thus, uniilas turn the act of summoning about on those who call upon them via a planar binding spell, requesting that such mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively casts a spell the uniila does not know (not one of those spells she possesses as a sorcerer spell or spell-like ability), or performs a spell of 5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to bind the devil. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed Charisma check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the devils, and even the most incompetent "masters" might prove useful in seeking out components of an uniila's ongoing projects in Hell.

Masters of corruption and despoilers of purity, devils seek to destroy all things good and drag mortal souls back with them to the depths of Hell.

As the most numerous fiendish occupants of Hell, the various forms of devils are well catalogued by diabolists. Most are known by two names: an evocative title given to the fiends by commoners and folklore, and an obscure, ancient designation spoken by the servants of Hell and those who would seek to deal with the damned.

Born from the foulest of mortal souls-their personalities and memories long since scoured by millennia of torment-would-be devils rise from the masses of suffering souls as lemures, revolting beings of mindless evil potentiality. Only through continued centuries of torture or by the edicts of more powerful devils do these least of devilkind rise to become deadlier fiends, graduating through a pain-wracked metamorphosis dictated by their masters or the infernal whims of Hell's semi-sentient layers. While fiendish lords wield transformation into greater or lesser forms as both prize and punishment, some devils spontaneously rise from particularly evil souls long trapped upon an infernal layer. Thus, although the various diabolical breeds possess recognizable abilities and hold generalized rankings in the great infernal hierarchy, a devil's type alone does not always correspond to a specific tenure of torment or place in the infernal chain of command.

Devils fill the nine layers of Hell, though certain fiends are more common on specific layers than others, their specialized duties or fealty to individual archdevils drawing them to one torturous domain more than others. Although the various types of devils tend to specialize in unique forms of depravity or temptation, the hierarchies of Hell are not without flexibility for uncommon individual talents. Thus, particularly watchful hamatulas might join the ranks of Phlegethon's bone devil inquisitors, while veteran barbazus might serve among the pit fiends of Nessus.

Beyond the pits of Hell, devils often travel to the Material Plane at the summons of evil spellcasters. Quick to bargain and willing to serve mortals to assure their damnation, devils ever obey the letter of their agreements, but serve the whims of Hell foremost. Thus, even the least of devilkind might come to the Material Plane intent on further corrupting souls, cleverly escaping the bonds of their contracts to indulge their own plots, or to further the unspeakable goals of the archdevils of Hell.

The Ranks of Devilkind

Diabolists speak often of the rankings of Hell, the distinctions made between devils that distinguish the foot soldiers from the commanders of Hell's armies. While such divisions mean little to most mortals-a devil being a deadly foe in any incarnation-the hierarchies and nuances of Hell's society carry distinctions vital to the survival of any who would commune with devils. What distinguishes a breed of devils above or below others is more than a matter of brawn, with several cunning types of fiend holding priority over their fundamentally stronger brethren. While a devil's station does not mean it can instantly command every other devil of inferior standing, it does imply which fiends might serve their brethren or hold influence over others.

Below these are the devil races themselves, from the lordly and malevolent pit fiends all the way down to the lowly, malformed lemure.

The Infernal Hierarchy

Listed here, from the absolute weakest devils to the lords of Hell, is the most basic hierarchy of the infernal realm's best-known denizens.

Least Devils: imps, lemures
Lesser Devils: bearded devils (barbazus), erinyes, barbed devils (hamatulas), bone devils (osyluths)
Greater Devils: horned devils (cornugons), ice devils (gelugons), pit fiends
