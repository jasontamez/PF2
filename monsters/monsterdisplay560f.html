Description

Creating a Dark Ice Creature

"Dark ice creature" is an acquired template that can be added to any fey without the fire subtype (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A dark ice creature uses all of the base creature's statistics except as noted here.

Size and Type: The creature's type is unchanged, but it gains the cold subtype. Its size is unchanged.

AC: A dark ice creature's natural armor bonus improves by +4, as a layer of thick permafrost toughens its now leathery skin and coats its body with a thin but durable shell of ice.

Defensive Abilities: A dark ice creature retains the base creature's defensive abilities and gains the following.

Fast Healing (Su): As long as a dark ice creature is in contact with ice or snow it heals 3 hit points per round.

Immunity to Cold (Ex): A dark ice creature is immune to cold.

Weaknesses: A dark ice creature retains the base creature's weaknesses and gains the following.

Fire vulnerability (Ex) A dark ice creature takes 1-1/2 times as much damage from fire.

Attack: A dark ice creature grows jagged oversized icicle talons in place of fingers, paws, or hooves, and it gains two vicious claw attacks if it did not already have them.
