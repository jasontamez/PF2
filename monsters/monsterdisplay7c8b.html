Special Abilities

Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb
spell, but the surfaces the demon climbs must be icy.
The demon can move across icy surfaces without penalty
and does not need to attempt Acrobatics checks to run or
charge on ice.


Mutilating Gouge (Ex) If the andrazku hits with both slams
in the same round, its target must succeed at a DC 17
Fortitude save or take 1 point of Charisma damage. The DC
is Constitution-based.


Description

Andrazkus are thugs who use their strength to lord over
weaker creatures. Their hatred is cold and seething, prone
to suddenly snapping in an avalanche of ice and crushing
blows. Birthed from the protomatter of the Abyss with
natural gifts for tracking and subduing prey, they are
sometimes used as trackers and jailors by more powerful
demons who need to find lost prisoners and slaves.


From the waist up these demons are built much like
strong, hairy humans or dwarves, but with exaggerated
proportions resembling those of a gorilla. Their thick
necks sport bristling manes that merge with the hair on
their backs, and their flat faces bear two ramlike horns
and cold eyes filled with hate. Their breath is a freezing
fog, and their teeth are small but numerous, like a
shark's. An andrazku's legs seem small in comparison
to its torso, bend backward like a satyr's, and end in large
cloven hooves. Their skin is the dead blue of a frozen
corpse or a frost giant. Their top-heavy builds mean they
have difficulty standing upright and normally assume
a hunched posture; many prefer to walk and run on all
fours, like apes. An andrazku is 7 feet tall at the shoulder
and weighs 450 pounds.

Ecology

An andrazku forms from the soul of a chaotic mortal who
hated women and used his or her power to oppress and
demean them, such as a tyrant who selectively enforced
laws against women, a priest who preached that women
are the source of all sin, or a father who secretly beat his
wives and daughters for their supposed failures. For this
reason andrazkus are known to scholars as -misogyny
demons.- Few of these souls dared to greater crimes
(which would cause their souls to become incubi or
babaus), nor were they once mortals who hated women
but never acted upon their hatred-an andrazku only
forms from a soul filled with suff icient hatred toward
women to provoke action, but that is hampered by
enough cowardice to prevent it from performing acts
of greater evil. Most of them were male mortals, but
an especially misogynistic evil female creature might
become an andrazku in the Abyss.


An andrazku grows excited when it senses its prey's
fear, but becomes frustrated if the hunt lasts for too
long. Despite these demons' masculine appearance
and aggression, most of them are impotent and some
completely lack genitalia, rendering their lust pointless.
Their nature is to berate, degrade, and beat; they tend to
kill only when they feel an urge to eat, when their stymied
passion becomes too great to tolerate, or when they are
mocked for their shortcomings.


An andrazku prefers to attack with its bite and fists
(often contemptuously slapping foes, minions, and prey
with an open hand), but a vicious one may use a scourge
and jagged-bladed sword as if pretending to be a balor.
Sadistic and cruel, andrazkus have been known to chase
down their prey, batter it for a while, and then release
it, giving it enough of a head start that it thinks it has
a chance of escaping. The andrazkus then track it down
(using locate creature and teleport) to repeat the cycle again.


An andrazku in a position of authority likes to mark
its minions and slaves with a scar on one side of the face
indicating the demon's ownership. The demon typically
uses its breath weapon to freeze a metal brand until it
is cold enough to leave a permanent mark. If a slave is
resistant or immune to cold, the demon uses a knife to
carve its mark into one side of the creature's face.


Because of their long-simmering tempers and magical
abilities, andrazkus are often called "cold demons,"
and they mainly live in frigid Abyssal realms such as
Jhuvumirak, home of demon lord Kostchtchie. Their
intolerance of fire (despite their demonic resistance to it)
and the cowardly nature of their origin-sin make them
laughingstocks among demons (particularly babaus and
incubi); as a result, andrazkus are sullen, resentful, and
prone to take out their frustrations on weaker creatures-
especially if said creatures are female.


Andrazkus prefer to lair in ice caves or tunnels dug out
of hard-packed snow. Some take advantage of their cold
immunity and strong swimming ability to live in simple
shelters on ice floes. An andrazku's hooves and huge
hands allow it to cling to ice as though it were rough
stone, preventing it from slipping and allowing it
to use much of the vertical space in its lair to
store treasure and observe intruders.

Habitat and Society


Andrazkus loathe associating with
more powerful female demons in any
way, and curse under their breath at
mariliths and similar demons of great
stature. Among female demons of similar
power, they are quick with clever words,
believable boasts, and secret confessions
of desire, but these are all lies to disguise
the hatred crackling beneath the surface.
If given the opportunity, an andrazku
would capture and torture a succubus
merely because she is female (though a
succubus is physically more powerful
than a lone misogyny demon, and the
hairy brutes have to gang up to have
any chance of defeating a "weakling"
succubus). Succubi and mariliths are
aware of these simple-minded feelings
held by andrazkus and they delight
in tormenting the brutish creatures.
Those female demons know they hold
greater strength and power than
andrazkus, and they enjoy lording
over the creatures, even going so far as to kidnap them
from time to time, bringing them to their own lairs and
forcing the creatures into servitude.


Andrazkus band together for strength, using their
telepathy to silently coordinate their attacks. They often
taunt their prey telepathically, either with words, promises
of violence, or mocking laughter.


When set loose on the Material Plane, an andrazku
usually forces itself into a position of power over a
humanoid tribe. Some ally with frost giant tribes,
especially those who worship Kostchtchie. Duller ones
find better company among girallons and dire apes.


Summoning Andrazku

Andrazkus are receptive to flattery about their size and
strength. They like offers of weapons and strengthenhancing
items as payment for their services. They can
be assigned to guard, hunt, or retrieve; any Charisma
check attempted as part a spell to convince an andrazku
to undertake a mission other than these kinds of tasks
takes a -2 penalty. A female summoner has a -10 penalty
on all Charisma checks made to bargain
unless the caster acts inferior
and unworthy of the
demon's aid.

Demons exist for one reason-to destroy. Where their more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape them into reflections of their own evil, demons seek only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy-for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon's depredations and flee to his just reward in the afterlife. It is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels a demon's lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.

Demons are the most prolific and among the most destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across the multiverse as the Abyss. Before the first fledgling deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully formed, the Abyss was infested with life.

Known to many scholars as "proto-demons," these wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, because of the influence of sinful mortal souls upon the Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the daemonic keepers of Abaddon and the cruel whims of fate and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the demonic hordes grows-a single soul can fuel the manifestation of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes and roles of the newly formed fiends.

The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the Maelstrom itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. Some flop on land while others flap in air or sea. Some are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work to the same goal-pain and suffering for mortal life in all its forms.

Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most demons find ways to twist their summoners' demands so that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks free of his control.

The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic sires to gift them with horrific children are common enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in support of that which would bring destruction to all.
