Tactics

Before Combat Every day, Arazni casts detect scrying, false life, greater magic weapon, mythic mage armor (cast from her staff of the magi), and overland flight on herself, using her arcane metamastery path ability to gain the benefit of Extended Spell with each. The effects of these spells and the use of mythic power already expended are reflected in Arazni's statistics.

Special Abilities

Exceptional Resources (Ex) Arazni has the wealth of a 20th-level PC, rather than an NPC. This increases her CR by 1. She used some of this wealth to create and read the following books to gain inherent bonuses to her ability scores: manual of gainful exercise +5, manual of quickness in action +4, tome of clear thought +5, and tome of leadership and influence +5.

Permanent Spells (Sp) Using permanency, Arazni gave herself the constant effects of arcane sight, resistance, and see invisibility. She is under the effect of a contingency that casts harm on her if she's brought below 100 hit points.

Description

Arazni was once a demigod and herald to Aroden. As the Red Crusader, she rode into battle during the Shining Crusade. Yet her bravery and might were of no avail against the Whispering Tyrant, who humiliated her before torturing her to death, throwing her broken form amid the ranks of her army to dishearten them. But even in death Arazni found no comfort. She lay in rest only 67 years before the overzealous Knights of Ozem provoked the witch-king Geb, who raised some of the fallen knights as grave knights and sent them to bring Arazni's revered remains to him. Not content with her corpse, he infused deathless vitality into her and bound her spirit up in her bones, making her his Harlot Queen. She rules still in his stead.

Arazni's onetime disciples in the Knights of Ozem have resolved to lay her finally to rest. The knights possess the Bloodstones of Arazni (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Artifacts & Legends 13): four of her organs kept in funerary jars, which they recovered from Geb. They believe those bearing these jars have the protection of both holy aura and mind blank against Arazni's magic (in addition to an ability unique to each jar). But whether the jars hold the key to truly destroying her has not yet been proven. The Harlot Queen plots in secret to destroy-or recover, if possible-all the remaining jars. Her graveknight bodyguards monitor for any sign of the Bloodstones. It's said that Arazni senses the location of a jar when it's used, but no one can be sure whether this is true or a rumor the Harlot Queen has spread to keep those relics from being used.

Arazni's Staff of the Magi (Minor Artifact): Arazni possesses an unusual staff of the magi that Geb recovered from a nameless pharaoh's tomb and offered his newly risen bride. This staff of the magi uses its wielder's caster level, Intelligence modifier, and feats when determining its spells' saving throws, rather than the set save DCs of a typical staff of the magi. In addition, if the wielder knows the mythic version of one of the staff "s spells, she can expend uses of mythic power to cast or augment that spell as if she were casting it normally. If the wielder doesn't know the mythic version of a spell, she can use the mythic version of that spell by expending one use of mythic power per 2 levels of the spell (rounding up); a mythic spell cast this way can't be augmented. The wielder can use metamagic feats in conjunction with spells cast from her staff if she has a way to apply the feats on the spot without increasing the spells" caster levels (such as Arazni's arcane metamastery path ability, a metamagic rod, or the Spell Perfection feat).

Arazni's staff of the magi can create unique fireballs, which cost 2 charges to cast. These fireballs begin as eruptions of black fire, but coalesce into explosive waves of freezing darkness. These fireballs can deal fire damage, cold damage, or half cold and half fire. Creatures failing their saving throws against such a fireball are staggered for 1 round by the force of the explosion. In addition, the area of the fireball is treated as deeper darkness until the end of the wielder's next turn. Any creature or object that enters the darkness during this time takes damage as if it had been in the area when the fireball was cast. This power replaces telekinesis.

Harlot's Kiss (Minor Artifact): Arazni's scarlet-hilted rapier is a relic of her days as the Red Crusader. Her blade acts as a +1 conductive dancing keen rapier, and its conductive property can be used once per round even while it is dancing.

The blade has two abilities only Arazni can use. If she hurls Harlot's Kiss using the hand of the apprentice ability, it can perform a full attack against a single target rather than a single attack, instantly returning to Arazni at the end of her turn. However, she can't use hand of the apprentice on the rapier while it's dancing. If Arazni expends one use of mythic power when commanding the weapon to dance, the weapon's attacks use her caster level as the base attack bonus (effectively gaining a +10 bonus on attack rolls) for as long as it dances.
