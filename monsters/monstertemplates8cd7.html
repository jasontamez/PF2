"Shadow lord" is an acquired template that can be added to any <a href="monstertemplates372c.html?ItemName=Shadow">shadow creature</a> with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most shadow lords were originally humanoids. A shadow lord retains all the base creature's statistics and abilities (including those granted by the shadow creature template) except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +2.
Alignment: Any evil.
Senses: A shadow lord gains the see in darkness ability.
Armor Class: Same as the base creature (see also the incorporeal step ability).
Defensive Abilities: A shadow lord gains the following defensive abilities.

Energy Resistance and Damage Reduction (Su): A shadow lord gains damage reduction and resistance to cold and electricity based on its Hit Dice, as noted on the table below. This replaces the energy resistance and damage reduction granted by the shadow creature template.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Hit Dice</td><td>Resist Cold and Electricity</td><td>DR</td></tr> <tr><td>5-10</td><td>15</td><td>10/magic</td></tr> <tr><td>11-15</td><td>20</td><td>15/magic</td></tr> <tr><td>16+</td><td>30</td><td>20/magic</td></tr></table>
Incorporeal Step (Su): When a shadow lord moves, it gains the incorporeal subtype and quality, including a def lection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus. It loses the incorporeal subtype and special ability when it stops moving.

Attacks: A shadow lord gains a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (Fortitude negates). The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shadow lord's Hit Dice + the shadow lord's Charisma modifier. On a critical hit, the shadow lord's touch attack also deals 1 point of Constitution damage (also negated by the saving throw).
Special Attacks: A shadow lord gains the following special attacks. Their saving throw DCs for these attacks are equal to 10 + 1/2 the shadow lord's Hit Dice + the shadow lord's Charisma modifier, unless otherwise noted.

Cloying Gloom Blast (Su): Three times per day, the shadow lord can unleash a 30-foot cone of cloying gloom. On a failed Fortitude saving throw, creatures in the cone are affected by a slow spell (caster level equal to the shadow lord's Hit Dice) and are blinded for the duration of the slow effect.

Spell-Like Abilities: A shadow lord gains the following spell-like abilities, with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice: at will-ray of sickening; 3/day'shadow conjuration, shadow step; 1/day-greater shadow conjuration (if the shadow lord has 11 or more Hit Dice), shadow walk.

A creature created with shadow conjuration or greater shadow conjuration that would normally have a celestial or fiendish template (such as a bear) instead gains the shadow creature template.

Special Qualities: A shadow lord gains the following special quality.

Planar Thinning (Su): Once per day as a full-round action, a shadow lord can thin the barriers between the Material Plane and Shadow Plane, making it considerably easier for creatures to cross between the two. This functions like the planar travel aspect of the gate spell (caster level equal to the shadow lord's Hit Dice). This planar thinning is immediately dispelled if in an area of normal or bright light.

Ability Scores: Dex +4, Cha +4.
Skills: A shadow lord gains a +8 racial bonus on all Stealth checks.
