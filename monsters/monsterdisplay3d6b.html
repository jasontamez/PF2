Special Abilities

Discoloring Touch (Su) By making a successful touch attack, a choxani can feed on the color of living things. A creature touched in this manner takes 1d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or gain a negative level. Attempting to drain a target fascinated by the choxani's hypnotic colors ability does not end the fascination effect, though successfully draining the target's color does. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Hypnotic Colors (Sp) As a standard action, a choxani can swirl its colors in a way that captures the attention of onlookers. This functions as hypnotic pattern (Will DC 14 negates), and the choxani's caster level is equal to its Hit Dice for the purpose of determining the total Hit Dice of creatures affected. A creature that successfully saves against this ability is immune to uses of it by the same choxani for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Pattern Reading (Su) As a full-round action, a choxani can let its subconscious thoughts form patterns on its skin, then interpret the results. This acts as augury, save that the chance of a meaningful reply is 10% times the choxani's number of Hit Dice, up to a maximum of 90%. Additionally, if a result would be "nothing""including as a result of failure" it is instead interpreted as one of the other three results, chosen randomly. The choxani has no way of knowing whether this ability has succeeded or failed.

Description

Also called "picture people," choxani embody those aspects of nature that resemble other things, from a chameleon changing color to a cloud blown into the shape of a dog. Choxani see these moments of representation as proof of the plan underlying all reality, and honor them with religious fervor. They communicate primarily through hand gestures and their constantly changing markings, which can form text or images. When eating, the colors on their fingers or faces stretch out into funnels, sucking in the colors of other organisms and leaving them lifeless gray husks. A typical choxani is 7 feet tall and 150 pounds.
