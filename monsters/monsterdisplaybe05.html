Description

Uintatheriums are large
browsing herbivores that
move through marshes,
plucking aquatic plants
from silty water with their
large front teeth. They
also use these front fangs
for defense when confronted
with a predator, and males-
who have larger fangs-use
them in mating displays.
Females also fight with their
teeth, though they prefer to
intimidate foes into leaving
them alone.

While an uintatherium has
a large, formidably protected
skull, its brain is rather small.
Dull-witted and slow to act, uintatheriums
are not particularly dangerous to those
who don't intentionally provoke them, and
they can be domesticated more easily than
most megafauna.

Uintatheriums stand nearly 6 feet tall at
the shoulder and weigh over 2 tons.
