Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) A khala can fire a jet of frigid liquid

succeed at the Reflex save, creatures caught in the line
must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be encased in ice.
A trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 Strength check or
DC 26 Escape Artist check as a full-round action to break free.
Disease (Ex) Chillbane Fever: Bite-injury; save Fortitude DC 27;
onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage,
sickened, and fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Tenacious Grapple (Ex) A khala does not gain the grappled
condition if it grabs a foe with its tail, and it can maintain a
grapple with its tail as a swift action.

Description

It is rumored that khalas were a breed of rare amphibious
dragon, warped through evil and wintry magic from
proud creatures into voracious and wicked things that
delight in the suffering of others. The creature ambulates
like a snake, slithering along the ground or through the
boughs of trees with its wings drawn close to its body, but
it prefers f light whenever possible. All khalas are female,
and scholars debate how the creatures procreate. It is
believed that the males of the species, known in legend as
the zmeys, were wiped out in a war with the khalas.
