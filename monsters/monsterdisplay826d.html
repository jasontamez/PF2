Special Abilities

Hot Climate Adaptation (Ex) A Chelish hell-bred dog gains a +8 racial bonus on Fortitude saves to avoid nonlethal damage from very hot environmental conditions.

Sulfurous Spittle (Ex) Once per hour as a standard action, a Chelish hell-bred dog can spray a 10-foot cone of sulfurous liquid from its mouth. Any creature caught in the cone is nauseated for 1 round and then sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save negates the nauseated effect and reduces the sickened effect to 1 round. A creature cannot use the scent ability as long as the sulfurous spray affects it. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

They're best known for their ability to spray sulfuric liquid similar to skunk musk from their mouths.

Fiend-bred animals are pedigreed varieties of animals whose bloodlines include an animal-like fiend. The breeders of these creatures typically use a conjuration spell of the calling subschool, such as planar ally or planar binding, to call a suitable fiend to the Material Plane and persuade it to mate with an animal of a compatible species. Most of the male hybrids are sterile, and thus the female hybrids of the first generations are mated with animal males until the new variety breeds true. Thereafter, breeders strive to emphasize trainability while retaining the most desirable traits derived from the progenitor fiend.

Fiend-bred animals are rare and incredibly expensive, and therefore most owners of the breed are nobles or other wealthy individuals. Cheliax has a long-standing tradition of producing fiend-bred animals, and most hell-bred dogs are from meticulously tracked bloodlines with records in official registers. Keleshites, on the other hand, typically record their stygian hot-blooded horses' ancestries through oral traditions passed down through ensuing generations.
