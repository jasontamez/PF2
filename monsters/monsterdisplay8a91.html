Special Abilities

Absorb Force (Su) Once per round, a witchwyrd can use a free hand to "catch" a magic missile fired at it. This absorbs the missile and manifests as a glowing nimbus around that hand (which is no longer considered free). The energy lasts 6 rounds or until it is used to create a force bolt. To use this ability, the witchwyrd must be aware of the incoming magic missile and cannot be flat-footed.

Force Bolt (Su) A witchwyrd can "throw" a magic missile (1d4+1 damage) from each free hand as a free action (maximum of two per round). If it has absorbed a magic missile, it can throw an additional force bolt that round, expending the absorbed energy (maximum of two additional bolts per round).

Description

Alien merchants that travel between planets and planes, witchwyrds stand 7 feet tall, weigh 300 pounds, and are covered in hairless blue-gray skin. Witchwyrds new to a market or eager to avoid identification during an important business deal fold their second sets of flexible arms behind their backs and dress in robes, the better to pass as a less-infamous humanoid race. Witchwyrds tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the areas they visit-perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world.
