**Ecology**

**Environment** any land or water (Plane of Earth)
**Organization** solitary, pair, or gang (3-8)
**Treasure** none

**Special Abilities**

**Earth Glide (Ex)** A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
**Entrap (Ex)** The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.
