"Winter fey" is an inherited template that can be added to any fey creature without the fire subtype, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A winter fey uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: As base creature +1.
Alignment: Any evil.
Type: The base creature's type remains fey, but it gains the cold subtype.
AC: Natural armor improves by +2.
Defensive Abilities: A winter fey retains the base creature's defensive abilities, and gains the following ability.
Fast Healing (Su): A winter fey gains fast healing 3 when in contact with ice or snow.
Speed: A winter fey retains the base creature's normal movement and gains the following.
Ice Walking (Ex): A winter fey takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through.
Attacks: A winter fey retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the winter fey can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage as if the winter fey were one size category larger than its actual size (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 301-302). If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the winter fey claw damage only if it's better.
Special Attacks: A winter fey retains the base creature's special attacks and gains the ones listed below.
Frigid Touch (Su): Once per day, a winter fey may attempt a touch attack against a foe; if successful, it deals 1d6 points of Dexterity damage by freezing the blood in its victim's veins and numbing its victim to the bone.
Frosty Grasp (Su): A winter fey's natural attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage.
Abilities: A winter fey's Strength and Constitution increase by +2.
Skills: A winter fey gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when in cold environments.
