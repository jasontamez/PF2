Hag Eye Ooze, Coven Ooze

This eerily disturbing gelatinous blob lumbers forward. Three
disembodied eyes float within its mass, seemingly scanning back
and forth with each surge of movement.

Special Abilities

Absorb Flesh (Ex) A coven ooze doesn't eat plants or inorganic
matter, but devours living flesh with voracious speed,
dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain to creatures it
engulfs. Whenever the ooze deals Constitution drain in this
manner, it heals 10 hit points for each point of Constitution
drained. Excess hit points above its normal maximum are
gained as temporary hit points. A coven ooze can gain
no more than 30 temporary hit points in this manner. If a
coven ooze has temporary hit points when it splits, those
temporary hit points are divided into its copies.


Hag Eye Ray (Sp) Every 1d4 rounds, each of the hag eyes
within a coven ooze can fire a magic ray at a target within
60 feet. Each hag eye emits a different spell effect: bestow
curse (DC 17, -6 to Dexterity), confusion (DC 17, 9 rounds),
hold person (DC 16, 9 rounds). All of these spell-like abilities
function at CL 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based,
and include a +8 racial bonus.


Split (Ex) Slashing and piercing weapons deal no
damage to a coven ooze. Instead, the creature
splits into three identical oozes, each with
one third of the original ooze's current hit
points (round down). Upon splitting, each
copy retains a single hag eye within its mass
and can continue to use its hag eye
ray ability, albeit with only one
spell effect. A coven ooze with
10 hit points or fewer, or that
doesn't have enough hag
eyes to result in each new
ooze getting its own eye,
cannot be split and instead takes
damage normally.


Description

Coven oozes result from a hag eye ooze's conglomeration
of multiple hag eyes, often caused by the destruction of a
hag coven with a hag eye ooze nearby. With its controller
gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its
mistress and her coven sisters. Through this consumption,
the creation gains some semblance of its creators' cunning,
independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters
had hag eyes of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its
form. Otherwise, consumption of the coven, with the
residual magic of the original hag eye, transforms one eye
from each of the hags in the coven into a functional hag eye.


A coven ooze wanders its creator's territory, devouring
any living organism it comes upon. With their animal
intelligence, they use the terrain to their best advantage,
often lying in waterways near frequented river crossings.


Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh
roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have
been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another
creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and
consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven
ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum
size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a hag
eye ooze, the creator of the hag eye ooze-if a hag-must
succeed at a DC 25 Will save or
have her connection to the
hag eye ooze severed.
