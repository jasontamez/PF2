Special Abilities

Difficult to Train (Ex) A quetzalcoatlus is remarkably difficult to train. Anyone trying to do so takes a -4 penalty on Handle Animal checks to train one of these looming pterosaurs.

Razor-Sharp Beak (Ex) A quetzalcoatlus's bite attack has a critical multiplier of x3.

Description

The quetzalcoatlus is perhaps the largest of the pterosaurs, a category of flying reptile common in regions where dinosaurs dwell. Known to some as the "swamp stalker" and others by the misnomer "dragonling," it is truly an awe-inspiring sight in the air, with an impressive 40-foot wingspan. On the ground, this creature's profile bears an uncanny resemblance to that of a giraffe, save for the fact that the folded wings arch up to either side of its lightly feathered body and its head bears a horrific but brightly colored razor-sharp beak
