Description

Scarabs are small, six-legged insects with sharp protrusions
on their front legs that they use for burrowing. They are
primarily coprophagous, eating dung for sustenance. An
individual scarab often spends days rolling a single ball
of dung across the desert until it can find the perfect
place to bury it and deposit eggs. Because they burrow
underground to create life, scarab beetles are associated
with burial rites. Some say scarab beetles' connection with
the dead gives them powers greater than those of normal
beetles, but as of yet there is no evidence this is true.
