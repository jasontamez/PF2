Bloodhaze Mosquito Swarm - Monsters







Bloodhaze Mosquito Swarm

A high-pitched whine issues forth from the haze of this surging crimson cloud. Within, thousands of tiny forms whir in agitation, each a tiny insect with a needle-like proboscis.

Special Abilities

Cling (Ex) If a creature leaves a bloodhaze mosquito swarm's square, the swarm takes 1d6 points of damage as dozens of insects tenaciously cling to the victim. A creature with bloodhaze mosquitoes clinging to it takes 1 point of Constitution damage at the end of its turn for the next 1d4 rounds. As a full-round action, the creature can remove the mosquitoes with a DC 18 Reflex save or by immersing itself in water. High winds or any amount of damage from an area-affecting effect destroys all clinging mosquitoes. The save DC is Dexterity-based. Once a group of clinging mosquitoes has dealt 4 points of Constitution damage, the mosquitoes detach and disperse to digest their meal.

Disease (Ex) Bloodhaze mosquitoes are bearers of a terrifying and deadly disease common to the jungle, known to most locals as sleeping sickness.

Sleeping Sickness: Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1d2 days; frequency 1 day; effect 1d4 Wisdom damage and target is fatigued, cure 2 consecutive saves or arsenic (see page 85 for more details).

Description

Thousands of species of insects make their home within the shelter of the Mwangi Expanse, but few elicit as much dread as the voracious bloodhaze mosquito. Migratory in nature, these ravenous insects amass in great numbers, forming swarms capable of feasting on the blood of humanoids and beasts alike. Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes' relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control.

A typical bloodhaze swarm contains more than 10,000 flying mosquitoes. Individually, each mosquito is smaller than a child's fingernail, yet together they form a terrifying assault. Their iridescent wings can refract light, creating a shimmering effect as they move in unison. This effect proves disconcerting to most animals, which wisely flee such clouds, their panic often alerting other jungle inhabitants to the swarm's presence.

Sleeping Sickness

Endemic throughout the Sodden Lands and the Mwangi Expanse, the parasitic affliction known as "sleeping sickness" is spread when flying insects inject tiny parasites into their unsuspecting victim's bloodstream, thus inducing fever, headache, joint pain, swelling of glands in the back and neck, and most notably fatigue. The disease gradually infects the brain, causing confusion, reduced coordination, difficulty keeping track of time, and insomnia.

While exceedingly dangerous, even when administered by a practiced healer, the best cure for this disease is dosing the patient with the poison arsenic (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 558). If the patient survives, there's a cumulative 30% chance per dose that the disease is immediately cured.
