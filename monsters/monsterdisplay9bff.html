Special Abilities

Gnaw (Ex) Termite swarms can burrow through
earth and wood but not stone or metal. Their
swarm attack and acid ignore hardness of 5 or less.

Lingering Sting (Ex) Creatures damaged by a
termite swarm's acid are sickened with pain
(Fortitude DC 17 negates). Creatures can
attempt a new save each round at the
end of their turn to end this effect. The
save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Termite swarms are the bane of
architects and engineers in warm
climes. They live in mounds and
nests, devouring growing plants,
decaying logs, and wooden structures
alike from the inside out, and can
quickly bring down even a solidly
constructed building. They
are nearly impossible
to eradicate, and react
with violence when their
mounds are threatened.
