Description

One of the most famous tsukumogami is the one-eyed
and one-legged umbrella creature known as kasaobake,
a creature that is alternately creepy, curious, and
mischievous. Kasa-obake are as likely to scare a creature
away as they are to assist it, though their seemingly
unpredictable nature always has a pattern behind it.
For instance, most kasa-obake react more positively to
those who treat their belongings well. Kasa-obake can be
sources of wisdom if approached correctly, but they are
also likely to tell amusing tall tales instead of the truth.

When an object reaches the 100-year anniversary of its crafting, sometimes it forms an amalgam with a <a href="monsterfamilies9402.html?ItemName=Kami">kami</a>, creating a creature known as a tsukumogami. Tsukumogami run the gamut in personality, outlook, and function. Objects that are well kept and cared for often form curious and helpful tsukumogami. Most commonly, tsukumogami are mischievous and frightening but not actually malign. Tsukumogami formed from objects that have been abandoned, neglected, or misused are dangerous both to the humans around and to themselves, as their uncontrolled rage might eventually transform them into <a href="monsterfamilies4db8.html?ItemName=Oni">oni</a>.


Creating a Tsukumogami

Tsukumogami is an acquired template that can be added to any <%MONSTER%Animated Object">animated object</a> (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A tsukumogami retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR + 2.

Alignment: Any.

Type: The creature's type changes to outsider (kami, native). Tsukumogami have good Reflex and Will saves, so increase the base creature's Reflex and Will saves to 2 + 1/2 its Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier.

Armor Class: A tsukumogami's natural armor bonus increases by 2.

Hit Dice: Retain the base creature's construct bonus hit points from size (if any). As outsiders, tsukumogami gain bonus hit points from high Constitution scores.

Spell-Like Abilities: Tsukumogami gain spell-like abilities based on their size, usable at will. The caster level is equal to the tsukumogami's Hit Dice.

As kami, tsukumogami gain immunity to petrification and polymorph effects; resist acid 10, electricity 10, and fire 10; telepathy 100 feet; fast healing 5; merge with ward; and ward. Though a tsukumogami loses its construct type, it keeps its hardness, low-light vision, and all its construct immunities. It can still be affected by spells that affect objects or constructs. A tsukumogami is always merged with its ward, and unlike most kami, it forms an amalgam with its ward, so it can move and communicate while merged.
