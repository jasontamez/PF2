Description

Monstrous cockroaches come in a wide variety of sizes and colors, ranging from dark brown or black to lighter shades such as red or yellow, sometimes with multicolored banding across their abdomens. They have six legs and antennae and many varieties have wings. Their exoskeletons tend to have a shiny, oily appearance, though it is dry. Monstrous cockroaches vary widely in size, growing from mere inches long to the size of small buildings.

Aside from the threat presented by overgrown cockroaches, occasionally when enjoying limitless supplies of food and few local predators, an area's population of normal cockroaches can grow to number in the millions. In such cases, the typically docile creatures can amass into dangerous swarms to protect their territories. Benefiting from their species' collective intelligence, hundreds of thousands of otherwise common cockroaches might amass in such swarms to defend their fertile territories or prey upon interlopers.

Variants

Monstrous cockroaches and cockroach swarms can be found throughout Golarion with dozens of different appearances. In several cases, these regional variations have adapted unique abilities.

Mwangi Hissing Cockroach: A fist-sized insect found throughout the Kaava Lands, the Mwangi Expanse, and the Sodden Lands, these inoffensive roaches hiss when threatened. When encountered in large swarms or grown to monstrous size, though, the insect's noises take on a fearsome quality.

Fighting Hiss (Ex) As a free action, a monstrous cockroach or cockroach swarm can make a loud hissing noise by forcing air through the breathing pores on its abdomen. This sound can be extremely disconcerting, and any creature within 20 feet with Hit Dice equal to or lower than the cockroach's must make a DC 14 Will save or be shaken until outside the hiss's area of effect. This is a sonic attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Keleshite Venomroach: Found throughout Casmaron and in eastern Avistan, the Keleshite venomroach bears three broad yellow stripes across its inky carapace. The everyday varieties are known for their painful sting, the annoying result of the creature's mild poison. In the monstrous varieties and when the pests collect in swarms this irritating poison can be deadly. The cult of Ghlaunder has discovered the use of swarms of these poisonous pests in recent years, seeding them amid cities to spread the taint of their parasitic deity.

Poison (Ex) Injury-bite, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d2 Dexterity. The save DC is Constitution-based.
