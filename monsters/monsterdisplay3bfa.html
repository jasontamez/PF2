Description

Though boreal creatures mostly resemble their temperate kin, the effects of sorcerous winter have bolstered them, making them stronger and much more dangerous. In basic shape and form they appear similar to their ancestors, but other characteristics reveal the creatures' altered nature. Their fur and skin are much paler, often shades of blue, gray, or simply white, and it is not uncommon for parts of these creatures to be cloaked in frost, especially their jagged claws and shaggy hair.

Since Baba Yaga's invasion, many creatures native to the eastern Linnorm Kingdoms have died out, unable to adapt to a land now dominated by ceaseless supernatural winter. However, despite this dramatic change in climate, a few particularly strong and hardy specimens managed to survive, and over the centuries the magical forces holding this realm in its grip have aided the evolution of species better suited to this harsh environment. This section provides examples of three such creatures and the inherited template for creating other boreal creatures.

Creating a Boreal Creature

"Boreal" is an inherited template that can be added to any Huge or smaller corporeal creature. This template cannot be applied to a creature with the fire subtype.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.
Type: The creature gains the cold subtype. If applied to a creature with the animal or vermin type, the creature's type changes to magical beast. Do not recalculate its Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.
Attacks: A boreal creature's natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage.
Abilities: Str +2, Con +2.
Skills: The creature receives a +4 bonus on Stealth and Survival checks in snow. An aquatic boreal creature receives a +4 racial bonus on Stealth and Survival checks at all times in frigid waters (its natural habit), instead of in snow.
Environment: The creature's natural environment changes to a cold climate.
Special Qualities: A boreal creature gains the following special quality.
Trackless Step (Ex): A boreal creature does not leave a trail in snow and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires. This special quality does not apply to aquatic boreal creatures.
