Night Hag - Monsters







Hag, Night Hag

Grisly fetishes and the rags of once fine clothes hang off the corpse-thin frame of this horrifying, sharp-fanged crone.

Special Abilities

Disease (Su) Demon Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Con damage (target must save a 2nd time or 1 point of the damage is drain instead); cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Dream Haunting (Su) A night hag can visit the dreams of chaotic or evil targets by using a special periapt known as a heartstone to become ethereal, then hovering over the creature. Once it does so, it rides on the victim's back until dawn. The sleeper suffers tormenting dreams and takes 1 point of Constitution drain upon awakening. Only another ethereal being can stop these nocturnal intrusions by confronting and defeating the night hag.

Heartstone (Su) All night hags carry a heartstone-a special gemstone worth at least 1,800 gp that is worn as a periapt. A heartstone's magic is fueled by the hag's spirit and proximity-once separated from its owner (or upon the hag's death), a heartstone retains its magic for only 24 hours before becoming a nonmagical gem again. The heartstone instantly cures any disease contracted by the holder. In addition, a heartstone provides a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws (this bonus is included in the statistics block above). A night hag that loses this charm can no longer use etherealness or soul bind until it finds a replacement gemstone.

Description

Terrifying murderesses and greedy soul brokers, night hags prey upon mortals while they're most vulnerable. Preferring to kill their prey slowly, haunting their dreams night after night, these hags trap the tormented souls of their victims within dark gems so they might be sold in the infernal markets of the outer planes. Night hags vary widely in appearance, standing between 5-1/2 and 7 feet tall, and weighing from 150 to 300 pounds.

Customizing Hag Covens

Any group of three hags can form a coven, but realistically, many types of hags will never cross paths or deign to work with one another. Blood hags are loath to form covens that are not under their control. Annis hags are likewise domineering, rarely working with more powerful hags. Storm hags usually prefer allying with other storm hags, but they will occasionally form covens with green hags or sea hags. Sea hags sometimes seek out a green hag to lead them. Mute hags-among the most powerful of mortal hags-relish the destruction of relationships, and their involvement in a coven is typically transient, lasting only as long as whatever barrier prompted them to seek sisters in the first place. Night hags and dreamthief hags are outsiders that wander the planes in search of victims. These cautious schemers do not hesitate to involve mortal hags in their machinations, readily joining covens when it proves expedient. Their immortality grants them great patience and enough time to plan contingencies so that betraying them becomes a risky proposition.

A typical hag coven can cast the spells listed in the green hag's monster entry (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 167). Blood hags, storm hags, and winter hags always grant the spells and abilities listed in their bestiary entries. To reflect the diversity of powers hags can invoke, Game Masters can customize the spell lists of covens based on their membership; each type of hag makes specific spells available to cast as coven magic.

All covens can cast the following spells, regardless of the hags that comprise them: <a href="spelldisplayc394.html?ItemName=Animate%20Dead">animate dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayedf1.html?ItemName=Baleful%20Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4414.html?ItemName=Bestow%20Curse">bestow curse</a>, <a href="spelldisplay3517.html?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya33d.html?ItemName=Commune">commune</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf711.html?ItemName=Dream">dream</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya816.html?ItemName=Forcecage">forcecage</a>, <a href="spelldisplay218d.html?ItemName=Mind%20Blank">mind blank</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7555.html?ItemName=Reincarnate">reincarnate</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya200.html?ItemName=Speak%20with%20Dead">speak with dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplay1ac4.html?ItemName=Veil">veil</a>, <a href="spelldisplay42e8.html?ItemName=Vision">vision</a>

If dryads, nymphs, and sprites represent the grace and beauty of unspoiled nature, then surely the annis hag, green hag, and sea hag embody its savage, destructive side. Though not fey themselves, hags appear to be somehow tied to nature, even if no more than as a distorted reflection of it. Hags are foul, wicked creatures, warped with cruelty and evil. Uniformly female and invariably repulsive, these misshapen crones plot dark deeds over bubbling cauldrons, either singly or in sinister triads known as covens.
