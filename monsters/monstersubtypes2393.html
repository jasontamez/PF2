Archons are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to lawful good-aligned Outer Planes. An archon has the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision. </li><li>Immunity to electricity and petrification. </li><li>+4 racial bonus on saves against poison. </li><li>Aura of Menace (Su): A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed at a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon's aura for 24 hours. </li><li>Teleport (Sp): Archons can use <a href="spelldisplaydada.html?ItemName=teleport,%20greater">greater teleport</a> at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of carried objects. </li><li>Truespeech (Su): All archons can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a <a href="spelldisplay4d62.html?ItemName=tongues">tongues</a> spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.</li></ul>
