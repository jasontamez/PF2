Gandareva - Monsters







Azi, Gandareva

Four massive claws extend from the coils of this gigantic serpent, each rivaling its monstrous draconic mouth in ferocity. Its skin pebbled like the sea bed, this dragon-like terror looks as if it could easily splinter even the sturdiest vessel.

Special Abilities

Amphibious (Ex) Although gandarevas are aquatic, they can survive indefinitely on land.

Breath Weapon (Su) A gandareva can spew forth a wave of thick, acidic ooze (60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 14d8 acid, Reflex 26 DC half ). In addition, every square affected by a gandareva's breath is covered in this vicious slurry for 1 minute. If a creature in the area succeeded at its save, it is entangled within the sticky muck, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal. If a creature failed its save, it is entangled and can't move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 26 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the muck very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. The muck retains its acidic quality until it dissolves. Thus, any creature that ends its turn in a square affected by the slime takes 3d8 points of acid damage (one-fourth of the breath weapon's initial damage). This ooze is as equally effective underwater as it is on land. The save and check DCs are Constitution-based.

Cursed to the Depths (Su) Once every minute, a gandareva can hiss a deadly curse that causes any single creature currently swimming to become much heavier and potentially begin sinking. The target must make a DC 23 Will save or instantly take a -10 penalty on all Swim checks as it feels unnaturally heavy for the next 5 minutes. During this time, a victim, even one with a Swim speed, must make a Swim check every round to move. Every Swim check that fails by 4 or less means the target makes no progress swimming, while failure by 5 or more means the target sinks by 10 feet. Remove curse ends this effect immediately. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Swim-By Attack (Ex) Nimble in the water despite its size, a gandareva can attack while swimming and continue its movement. When using the attack action with one of its natural weapons, a gandareva can move both before and after the attack. The distance moved cannot be longer than a gandareva's swim speed. When a gandareva performs this action, it does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature attacked, but may draw attacks of opportunity from other creatures in the combat. A gandareva must move at least 5 feet both before and after the attack.

Description

A menace to the open waters, gandarevas terrorize ships that dare to sail through their domain. Frequently identified as sea serpents by superstitious sailors, gandarevas possess four mighty arms, capable of plucking travelers from the decks of their ships and flinging them into stormy seas. Their mighty wings serve them almost as well above the waves as beneath, allowing them to sail over the waves nearly as swiftly as they swim below them. An adult gandareva measures almost 30 feet long and weighs upward of 15 tons.
