Description

In humanoid form, werespiders are squat, compact, and usually have short, dark brown or black hair. Their eyes tend to be large and dark, and their fingers almost constantly twitch. Their faces are often shiny with natural oils, and the chins of male werespiders are commonly covered in prickly black stubble. Werespiders enjoy the company of kin, having large families and even larger networks of friends and acquaintances. They like to pass information through these communities, creating a web of contacts that can sometimes stretch over several towns. Werespiders that like to sit at the centers of large organizations often employ non-entothrope informants and spies to be on the lookout for the information they desire, slipping feelers into all aspects of their communities.

Werespiders prefer not to fight by themselves. They are most comfortable when outnumbering their foes. When threatened, a lone werespider attempts to scuttle off to a safer location, usually one full of his allies. Such places are often filled with traps designed to immobilize or poison targets' sometimes both. When werespiders catch victims in these devices, they are quick to move the corpses out of the way and reset the traps, leaving the looting of the bodies for when they feel secure once again.

Entothropes are humanoids with the ability to turn into large insects and insect-humanoid hybrids.


Creating an Entothrope

"Entothrope" is an inherited (for natural entothropes) or acquired (for afflicted entothropes) template that can be added to any humanoid.

Challenge Rating: Base humanoid's or base vermin's CR (whichever is higher) + 1.

Size and Type: The humanoid (referred to as the base creature) gains the shapechanger subtype. The entothrope takes on the characteristics of a type of vermin (referred to as the base vermin) within one size category of the base creature's size. An entothrope's hybrid form is the same size as the base creature or base vermin, whichever is larger.

Armor Class: In hybrid or vermin form, the entothrope uses the base vermin's natural armor bonus or gains a +2 natural armor bonus, whichever is higher.

Defensive Abilities: A natural entothrope gains DR 10/ silver in hybrid or vermin form. An afflicted entothrope gains DR 5/silver in hybrid or vermin form.

Speed: Same as the base creature's or base vermin's speed, depending on which form the entothrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature's speed, unless the entothrope has a CR of 5 or higher, in which case it gains all of the base vermin's additional speeds (such as a climb or fly speed) in hybrid form.

Melee: An entothrope gains natural attacks in hybrid and vermin forms according to the base vermin.

Special Abilities: An entothrope retains all the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base creature. In hybrid or vermin form, it gains the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base vermin. An entothrope also gains darkvision 60 feet and the following abilities.

Change Shape (Su): All entothropes have three forms-a humanoid form, a vermin form, and a hybrid form. Equipment doesn't meld with the new form between humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms and vermin form. A natural entothrope can shift into any of its three alternate forms as a move action. An afflicted entothrope can assume vermin or hybrid form as a fullround action by succeeding at a DC 15 Constitution check, or humanoid form as a full-round action by succeeding at a DC 20 Constitution check. On nights when the moon is new, an afflicted entothrope gains a +5 morale bonus on Constitution checks to assume hybrid or vermin form, but a -5 penalty on Constitution checks to assume humanoid form. An afflicted entothrope reverts to its humanoid form automatically with the next sunrise, or after 8 hours of rest, whichever comes first. A slain entothrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead. For additional rules on this supernatural ability, see page 291.

Curse of Entothropy (Su): A natural entothrope's bite or sting attack in hybrid or vermin form infects a humanoid target with entothropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim's size is not within one size category of the entothrope, this ability has no effect.

Entothropic Empathy (Ex): In any form, natural entothropes can communicate with vermin related to their vermin forms, even though most vermin are mindless. Entothropes can attempt Diplomacy checks to alter such a creature's attitude, and when doing so gain a +4 racial bonus on the check. This act implants the vermin with a modicum of intelligence, allowing the entothrope to train these vermin or otherwise use them as effective allies. Afflicted entothropes gain this ability only in hybrid or insect form.

Insect Mind (Ex): In human or hybrid form, an entothrope gains a +4 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects.

Ability Scores: Int -2 and Wis +2 in all forms; Dex +2 and Con +2 in hybrid and vermin forms. Entothropes are observant, but their minds work in inefficient ways. In addition to these adjustments to the base creature's stats, an entothrope's ability scores change when she assumes hybrid or insect form. In human form, the entothrope's ability scores are unchanged from the base creature's form. In hybrid and insect form, the entothrope's ability scores are the same as the base creature's or the base vermin's, whichever ability score is higher.

Entothropy

A creature that catches entothropy shows no symptoms (and does not gain the template) until the night of the next new moon, when the victim involuntarily assumes vermin form and forgets her identity. The character remains in vermin form until the next dawn and remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless she succeeds at a DC 20 Will save, in which case she becomes aware of his condition.

A <a href="spelldisplay5726.html?ItemName=heal">heal</a> or <a href="spelldisplay96a6.html?ItemName=remove%20disease">remove disease</a> spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher cures the affliction, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting entothrope's attack. Alternatively, consuming a dose of belladonna (but not wolfsbane) allows an afflicted entothrope to attempt a new Fortitude save to recover from entothropy.

Entothropic Player Characters

When a PC becomes an entothrope, you as the GM have a choice to make. In most cases, you should take control of the PC's actions whenever she is in hybrid or vermin form-entothropy shouldn't be a method to increase a PC's power, after all, and what an afflicted entothrope does while in hybrid or vermin form is often at odds with what the character would actually want.
