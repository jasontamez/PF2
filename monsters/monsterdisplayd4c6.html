Special Abilities

Digest (Ex) A target that takes swarm damage from an
undigested swarm is covered in acidic slime and must
succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of acid
damage for 1d4 rounds at the start of its turn. An affected
creature can make a new save as a full-round action.
Washing off the acid grants a +4 bonus on this save. The
save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Whereas individual undigested are more of a nuisance
than a threat to adventurers, a swarm of such creatures
can be dangerous to even experienced adventurers.
An undigested swarm comprises hundreds of
individual undigested. Driven by insatiable
hunger, they fall upon and consume any
living creatures crossing their path,
surrounding the unfortunate
victims and drenching
them in acidic slime,
digesting their still-living
prey even before the screaming ends.
