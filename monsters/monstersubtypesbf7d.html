A mortic is a humanoid creature infused with necromantic energy but not truly undead. Although mortics reproduce to create others of their kind, usually living in tight-knit communities, a humanoid of any type might become a mortic through overwhelming exposure to negative energy. Mortics vary in their abilities based on their original humanoid type, and each mortic has a humanoid subtype in addition to the mortic subtype. Mortics have racial Hit Dice and never substitute such Hit Dice for class levels like some humanoids do. All mortics have the following traits unless otherwise noted in a specific creature's entry. <ul><li>Darkvision 60 ft. </li><li>A mortic's good save is always Fortitude. </li><li>Negative energy affinity. </li><li>A mortic treats Intimidate, Perception, and Stealth as class skills. </li><li>Death Gasp (Su): A mortic that holds her breath suspends the majority of her living processes. While holding her breath, a mortic is immune to ability drain, energy drain, and sleep effects. A mortic who holds her breath is also immune to bleed effects, disease, and poison; any such effects are suspended for as long as the mortic holds her breath, although this doesn't cure any damage that the bleed effect, disease, or poison has already done. A mortic can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times her Constitution score. </li><li>Unliving Nature (Ex): Although a mortic is a living creature, she is treated both as undead and as her normal type and subtype for the purposes of spells and effects (for example, she can be detected with <a href="spelldisplay5c7d.html?ItemName=detect%20undead">detect undead</a> and rendered immobile by either <a href="spelldisplayebe1.html?ItemName=halt%20undead">halt undead</a> or <a href="spelldisplay9304.html?ItemName=hold%20person">hold person</a>). A mortic never takes a penalty on Disguise checks to disguise herself as an undead creature. Mortics gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. </li><li>Vulnerable to Consecration (Ex): A mortic is staggered within the area of a <a href="spelldisplay5b97.html?ItemName=consecrate">consecrate</a> effect.</li></ul>
