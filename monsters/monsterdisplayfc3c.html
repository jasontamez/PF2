Description

A psychepore is a symbiosis of two different plant
creatures-a lurching bit of undergrowth distantly
related to the shambling mound and an intelligent
cluster of hard fungal growths that possess a malevolent
hive mind. On their own, the shambling undergrowth
is an unintelligent creature, barely aware enough to
move itself to new sources of sunlight and water, while
the fungal conks, for their part, are intelligent but
immobile. The two pose a serious threat only once the
psychic fungus infests the shambling undergrowth, and
the creatures transform into the horrifying psychepore.

A psychepore procreates through microorganisms in
its poison, spreading into victims fungal spores that
try to bond with that host's physiology to create a
new psychepore. Generally, the only creatures
with which these spores can coexist are
the shambles that form the base of a
psychepore, but these spores also have
strange effects on creatures that aren't
their typical hosts. Such
creatures suffer from
delusional visions as
their minds try to
assimilate or reject the
images presented by the
alien will of the strange
symbionts, and their bodies
desperately attempt to force
the foreign spores out. Some
cultures harvest psychepores
to distill their poison into
a powerful drug, using it in
religious rituals that search for
inner knowledge or in dark alleys
as a temporary escape from cruel,
short lives-or transforming it into
a truth serum used during psychological
torture and other types of interrogation.

Most psychepores attack only in vain
attempts to procreate, never seeming frustrated by their
usually futile efforts, but more intelligent specimens
pursue less direct but more fruitful approaches, often
serving those who aid in gathering the undergrowth
they need to replicate. There are rumors of even more
highly developed and intelligent versions of these
creatures that learn the secrets of telepathy and how to
adjust their poison to replicate possession magic. These
superintelligent psychepores become more aware of
cultural structures and take great joy in manipulating
other forms of life to achieve their goals.

A psychepore is a hulking thing with a dense
composition. It stands 6 feet tall or slightly taller and
weighs about 300 pounds.
