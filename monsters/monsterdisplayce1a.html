Special Abilities

Poison (Ex) Giant blowfish venom causes violent seizing of the muscles. Any non-aquatic creature affected must immediately begin making Constitution checks to continue holding its breath (see page 445 of the Core Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based.
<table class="inner"><tr><td>Slam and quills-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex, prevents breath holding; cure 1 save.</td></tr></table>

Quills (Ex) Any creature attacking a giant blowfish with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons, or an unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a giant blowfish takes 2d6 points of piercing damage each round it does so. Creatures damaged by a giant blowfish's quills must also save or be poisoned.

Description

These gigantic cousins of common blowfish, covered in poisonous spearlike quills, can reach up to 10 feet in size, and nearly double that when fully inflated.
