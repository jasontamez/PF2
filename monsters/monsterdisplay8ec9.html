Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) Once
every 1d4 rounds, as a
standard action, a uraeus's
head can expel a 30-footline
of poison. All creatures
in the area are blinded for
1 round and must save against
poison (Reflex DC 15 negates both). As
a full-round action, a uraeus can either expel two lines or
bite with one head and breathe poison with the other. Each
head tracks its breath weapon's availability separately.

Poison (Ex) Bite or breath weapon-contact or injury; save Fort
DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; initial effect blinded
and paralyzed for 1 round; secondary effect blinded for 2d4
rounds; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Description

Uraeuses are sacred river protectors that harry those who
dare threaten their waterways. Far from simply territorial,
these flying serpents keep their rivers safe for travelers
and local communities as an act of devotion to their
mother goddess. When a group of uraeuses is too small to
handle a threat, they sometimes seek aid from adventurers
whose names are well known along their waters. When not
troubled by dangers near their nests, uraeuses often hunt
dangerous prey such as river beasts grown to monstrous
size. Uraeuses believe in just rule, and become infuriated
by attempts to corrupt local leaders. In times of unusual
danger, uraeuses may actively travel to a ruler's side to
warn that ruler against those who would lead her into folly.

Uraeuses accept offerings from any who live near or
travel their rivers. In exchange, they teach allies how to use
the river's bounty and how to best serve society. Patience,
industry, and a willingness to listen to others are among the
qualities they seek to instill in those who ask their help. In
addition, uraeuses are always vigilant in case a supplicant
turns out to be a useful servant for their goddess.

Most uraeuses measure nearly 7 feet in length, have a
wingspan of similar size, and weigh about 150 pounds.
Despite being a two-headed creature, a uraeus speaks with
a single voice that emanates from both heads at once.

Uraeus Oracle

Uraeuses born with a special connection to their deity
receive cryptic visions and warnings that allow them to
protect their homes and discern others' true intentions.
Uraeus oracles can use augury and divination 1/day and
commune 1/week, and they advance with levels of oracle.
