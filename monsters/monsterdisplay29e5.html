Description

The troglodyte is a feral, savage cave dweller. They are among the most populous denizens of the upper reaches of the endless caverns of the underworld, equally at home raiding the settlements of those who dwell above or below ground, yet for all their race's fecundity and sprawl, as a whole they represent only a minor threat. At times, great leaders can draw legions of troglodytes to their command to create vast and deadly armies, but left to their own devices, troglodyte tribes are content to keep each other under control with numerous feuds, cannibalistic raids, and bitter civil wars.

The troglodyte is one of the oldest of intelligent races, and ruins found in some remote caverns testify to the fact that their empire was once among the largest in the world. At the dawn of time, the troglodyte civilization was generations ahead of other humanoid races-while those races hid in caves and worshiped fire, the troglodytes raised vast cities of stone ziggurats and twisting canals, kept other races as slaves, and worshiped ancient and inhuman gods and demons. Yet as the other races evolved and grew increasingly civilized, they outstripped their onetime troglodyte oppressors. Today, the roles have changed-now it is the troglodyte that hides in caves and lives the life of a feral savage.

Religion is strong among troglodyte tribes, and their shamans and priests are universally the highest regarded members of a clan. A troglodyte chieftain is not always a cleric or druid, but those who do not have divine power are usually mere mouthpieces and puppet lords that answer to the beck and call of the local seer or shaman. Troglodytes generally worship one of the countless demon lords, particularly those of a reptilian or primeval shape and form or those whose Abyssal domains most closely resemble the tangled caverns troglodytes prefer. Troglodyte druids are usually neutral evil if they dwell with their own kind (and are universally feared and respected for the eerie command they have over beasts).

A typical troglodyte stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.

Troglodyte Variants

Although most troglodytes are represented by the cavedwelling creatures documented in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, after untold millennia, several troglodyte variants have evolved from the ancient xulgath bloodline and adapted to life in different environments and climates.

Enlightened Troglodytes (CR 2): These troglodytes dwell far deeper underground than most of their kind. Less bestial than other troglodytes but just as vile, they use their intelligence to enslave more primitive races. They become experts at taming beasts to serve as mounts and sentries.

An enlightened troglodyte's ability scores are Str 14, Dex 17, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 13, and Cha 13. A typical enlightened troglodyte's skills (not counting ranks gained through class levels) are Handle Animal +6, Stealth +5 (+9 in rocky areas), and Perception +3.

Kaergath (CR 1/2): Squat, warty, and diminutive, these troglodytes average just under 4 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds. Kaergaths have dull reddish-brown scales and huge, square teeth, but lack the claws of the other troglodytes. Native to the upper reaches of the subterranean wilderness underneath trackless deserts and sun-scorched badlands, kaergaths are known for their ability to burrow through sand, their expertise with the javelin, and their preference for the flesh of humanoid children.

Kaergaths are troglodytes with the young simple template and the ability to burrow through sand and loose earth (but not stone) at a rate of 20 feet per round. They gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls with javelins. Kaergaths have a bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage, but do not have claw attacks.

Troglodyte Paragons (CR 5): Although most of the ancient xulgath race perished with the collapse of its great empire long ago, a few powerful individuals survived. These ancient troglodytes went into hiding in the deep places of the world, and though many of them perished, fled to other planes, or retreated into lichdom, a few sought refuge in magical stasis. Over the long centuries, troglodyte paragons have from time to time awakened from their magical slumber. Though some have sought out modern troglodytes in an effort to elevate them and reclaim the glory of their lost civilization, most troglodyte paragons despise their degenerate descendants. Distinguished from common troglodytes by their glowing, emerald eyes and goldtinged scales, troglodyte paragons are long-lived, with maximum lifespans averaging 400 years. Troglodyte paragons are extremely paranoid and obsessed with self-preservation. Most troglodyte paragons have class levels in cleric or sorcerer.

Troglodyte paragons are Large troglodytes with 7 Hit Dice. Their natural armor bonus increases by 2, their claw attacks deal 1d8 points of damage, and their bite attacks deal 1d6 points of damage. Troglodyte paragons have the following ability scores instead of the standard troglodyte ability scores: Str 22, Dex 9, Con 16, Int 13, Wis 10, and Cha 15. They can use the following spell-like abilities: constant-arcane sight; at will-hypnotism, speak with animals (dinosaurs and reptiles only); 3/day-cause fear, charm monster. Troglodyte paragons with at least 14 Hit Dice (including both racial HD and those from class levels) can also use dominate monster once per day. A typical troglodyte paragon's skills (not counting ranks gained through class levels) are Intimidate +9, Perception +7, Stealth +10 (+14 in rocky areas).

Xulgaths

Xulgath is the proper term for the troglodyte race- their modern name is a derisive term coined by other species. The xulgath inhabitants of the lowest Darklands (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Occult Bestiary 61) continue the legacy of their species, and are far more powerful and proud than their lesser kin. Xulgaths are gifted with potent psychic gifts, which work in tandem with the psychogenic secretions they emit. Unlike their degenerate troglodyte descendants, true xulgaths can master a variety of classes, with an emphasis on martial classes and a small number of psychics.

Xulgaths show no mercy toward troglodytes who invade their domain. Slaying their devolved kin on sight, xulgaths view them as weak castoffs, bereft of the blessing of their dark gods. Despite this, dozens of the strongest troglodyte tribes reside in close proximity to their former kin, hoping against hope for some form of recognition or acceptance by their ancestors. Although scorned, these troglodyte tribes effectively safeguard the borders of xulgaths' territory from outsiders. Such tribes also provide a veil of false savagery and ignorance over xulgaths' temple cities, where they strive to restore their dominance via obedience to their alien deities.

Latent Troglodytes (Troglodyte Variant, CR +1): By some genetic miracle of evolutionary remembrance, some troglodytes regain the psychic abilities of their xulgath forbearers. These troglodytes gain a xulgath's psychogenic secretions supernatural ability. These touched troglodytes also gain the following: Psychic Magic (CL 3rd; concentration +3), 4 PE-mind thrust I (1 PE, DC 11), mindlink (1 PE, DC 11), suggestion (2 PE, DC 12).
