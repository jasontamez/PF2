Special Abilities

Gaze (Su) Death (if 6 HD or less) or 6d6 damage and panicked for 2d4 rounds (7 HD or more), range 30 feet, Will DC 25 negates the death or panicked effect. This gaze is a mind-affecting fear effect that causes its targets to perceive Basileus as the most terrifying thing that it can imagine. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Terror Shape (Su) While using his gaze ability, Basileus manifests one to five monstrous limbs that can make slam attacks.

Veil of Forms (Su) All creatures see Basileus as a powerful and attractive member of their own race. While using this ability, Basileus's gaze ability is suppressed. He can activate or suppress this ability as a free action.

Description

An infernal paradox at once wondrous and terrifying, tempting and blasphemous, Basileus serves as the herald of Asmodeus and the harbinger of Hell's will. Few who have met him survive the experience unchanged, for he is the very word of Hell.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
