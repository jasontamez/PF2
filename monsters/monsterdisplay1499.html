Sikari Macaque Swarm - Monsters







Sikari Macaque Swarm

Hundreds of tiny, hairless, reddish-hued monkeys burst from the thick jungle canopy. All at once, they're climbing every tree, swinging from every branch, covering every inch of the ground. Their mouths seem permanently open in a yowling shriek, a cacophony of rage only half as fearsome as their tiny, bulbous black eyes.

Special Abilities

Diseased (Ex) Sikari macaque swarms are driven to attack as a symptom of a disease infecting their species. A remove disease, heal, or similar malady curing effect instantly halves a swarm's hit points, causing dozens of the normally benign primates to stop their attack and wander off.

Distraction (Ex) Any living creature that begins its turn with a Sikari macaque swarm in its square must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Sikari Rage (Ex) When a creature is damaged by a Sikari macaque swarm, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be affected as if by the spells confusion and rage-a kind of blind fury known as Sikari rage. These effects last for 1d6 rounds, and the effects of multiple bites are cumulative.

While the fast-acting nature of this effect is similar to a poison, it is actually a disease, and the spell remove disease immediately ends the effects. Creatures that are immune to disease are also immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Often called the Red Wind, a churning mass of Sikari macaques feels no fear, barely acknowledges pain, and destroys everything in its path. A species of monkeys native to the Sikari region of Vudra, Sikari macaques are small, hairless, and mean. Their appearance and temperament are not native traits, however, as within recorded Vudran history nearly every member of the species has fallen victim to a mysterious affliction known as Sikari rage. Thus, what was once a highly social and endearingly curious breed of tawny-furred monkeys has been reduced to gangs of flesh-hungry brutes shrieking through jungle boughs, consuming and demolishing anything in their path.

A typical Sikari macaque stands just over 1 foot tall and weighs less than 5 pounds. Swarms of these deadly primates usually number from 30 to nearly a hundred.
