Special Abilities

Dinosaur Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it works only on dinosaurs. A saurian gains a bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier (+26 for most saurians).

Roar (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a saurian can unleash a terrible roar, affecting all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is instead staggered for 1d4 rounds. This ability is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Saurians make their homes on the sides of tropical volcanoes or tropical mountains. Though they respect all life, saurians consider themselves the protectors of primordial creatures and defend them violently when the need arises.

Saurians stand 20 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds.
