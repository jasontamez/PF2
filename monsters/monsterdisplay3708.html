Special Abilities

Burst of Restoration (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a prydanu can strengthen its aura to undo the physical tampering of others. Each creature within its aura suffering from a detrimental or unwanted transmutation effect can attempt a new saving throw against the effect. This power also works on any afflicted lycanthrope, entothrope, or similar creature, granting it a new saving throw to remove its affliction. At the GM's discretion, burst of restoration can have a special effect on creatures permanently mutated by magic, such as <a href="monsterdisplay4450.html?ItemName=Drider">fleshwarps</a> or <a href="monsterdisplay7309.html?ItemName=Mana%20Wastes%20Mutant%20(Gnoll)">Mana Waste mutants</a>. A creature undergoing this greater effect loses its unwanted acquired templates or reverts back to its original form, but it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 2 permanent negative levels as a result of the sudden and dramatic change to its physiology. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Clarity's Grace (Su) A prydanu's aura protects those around it from mind control and all forms of deception, both magical and mundane. All allies within her aura gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities and on Sense Motive skill checks. A prydanu's aura negates illusions. This functions as <a href="spelldisplaye3d9.html?ItemName=globe%20of%20invulnerability">globe of invulnerability</a>, except it can affect only spells or spelllike abilities from the illusion school and can affect spells of any spell level.

Lucid Rain (Su) Once per week as a full-round action, a prydanu can create an area of light rain centered on her with a radius of 120 feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any creature touched by the rain that is under the effects of a mind-affecting spell or effect can attempt a new saving throw to end those effects. Prydanus often use this ability during naturally occurring rainstorms on villages or cities they feel may be in trouble.

Description

Prydanus are fierce champions of Elysium who use their talents to undo the work of oppressors by revealing their deception and releasing their victims from bondage. Among the prydanus' most hated foes on Golarion are the alghollthus. Prydanus are drawn to civilizations under the thrall of tyrants. Prydanus do not tolerate such deceptions, and they combat them without hesitation whenever they encounter them. However, this lack of restraint sometimes makes for shortsighted plans of action leading to other consequences along the way.

Prydanus pride themselves on being guardian figures, and they delight in helping distressed individuals, especially those attempting to escape from any form of subjugation. Given their natural tendency toward vanity, prydanus appreciate (and perhaps even expect) being showered with praise for their good deeds, and those who sufficiently stoke a prydanu's ego may find a returning ally in that azata when future troubles arise.

Radiant and poised, a prydanu appears as an attractive humanoid with small patches of iridescent scales on its glistening skin. A graceful pair of translucent finlike wings extends from its back, not only allowing it to soar with ease but also granting it impressive agility underwater. Their striking silver eyes are framed with long, feathery lashes and match their metallic-colored nails and lips. A prydanu's hair varies from one individual to another but is usually several shades and decorated with jewels, flowers, shells, or other such adornments.

A typical prydanu stands 8 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.

Ecology

Creatures of Elysium, prydanus arise from the souls of brave liberators and defenders of justice. Though they enjoy spending time on their native plane, they often to venture onto the Material Plane, where they scour the lands for oppression.

Prydanus are well adapted to the water and often make temporary dwellings near oceans and lakes. When it comes to underwater prowess, their sleek musculature and powerful wings place them on par with naturally aquatic creatures. This aptitude is a point of pride for prydanus, who enjoy racing marine life to prove their expertise.

The anatomy of prydanus resembles that of humanoids, and while they cannot reproduce, they engage in intimate acts with one another or mortal lovers. Similarly, they don't need to eat or drink, but they partake of these pleasures in the spirit of camaraderie.

Habitat and Society

Prydanus enjoy the company of their kin, finding particular companionship in ghaeles and yamahs. Prydanus are athletic creatures, and their fondness for swimming and flying is well documented; presenting it a gift of artwork depicting seascapes or a collection of feathers and shells is a way to get on its good side. They are also quite sentimental and keep small trinkets from places and people they've helped, often displaying these tokens in the form of small charms worn on bracelets or necklaces or woven into their colorful locks.

After using their powers to free creatures from domination and forced transformation, prydanus often continue to care for them even after their liberation to ensure they're safe before continuing on their way. Though these sojourns are fleeting even by mortal standards, prydanus easily become emotionally attached to the creatures they save, and saying farewell is difficult for them. As such, most prydanus leave their companions' sides in the middle of the night, when most are sleeping, to make the parting easier.

When not battling against tyranny, prydanus enjoy studying emancipated societies to view the daily life of mortals left to make their own choices. They chronicle these thoughts and observations in journals, which they then share with other celestials in Elysium.

Azatas are a race of celestials native to the plane of Elysium, where the pursuit of freedom and goodness is paramount. Azatas are champions of these concepts, great bards, knights, and explorers who roam the planes in search of good folk in need of their help. Frequently described as the most elven or fey-like celestials, azatas nevertheless often have strange, inhuman shapes or can take elemental or eldritch forms. Most have some knightly or courtly title, such as duke, countess, or prince, apparently hereditary, perhaps from a celestial monarchy long abandoned and forgotten. Azatas do not exploit these titles to exert influence over each other, instead using them for personal identification or a bit of self-importance. They are deadly and resolute foes of evil, fearless and clever in battle.

It is not surprising that the three best-known kinds of azatas can all fly, for they rarely stay in one place for long and prefer the thrill of motion and discovery to creature comforts. Most azata "settlements" are little more than a collection of tents around a landmark, gathered over the course of a day to share news, stories, and perhaps good-natured duels, and then packed up again a few days later. Such temporary settlements are colorful and have a celebratory atmosphere, as azatas are quick to greet any of their kind as old friends. Although few can predict when and where an azata community might arise, some groups or breeds of azatas gather in cycles for traditional festivals and reunions. Such gatherings typically take place at a time of mystical consequence, such as on the evening of the lunar equinox, or during less predictable times, such as upon the wedding of two seers, and always in a place of pristine or stunning natural wonder. All azatas fundamentally know when and where the closest or next gathering of their people might occur, and while none are required or even expected to attend, all are welcome. These gatherings do not preclude more permanent azata holdings and communes, however, and the heights of Elysium endlessly ring with the songs of azata choirs.

While the stoic, homebound archons call their cousins flighty, azatas are driven by a crusading nature and feel bored when forced to stay in one place too long. This tendency also means they are unlikely to agree to serve mortals for an extended period of time, preferring to arrive, get the job done, and move on to some other quest or challenge. As much as they seek to spread the cause of freedom and joy, azatas realize that they cannot enforce such virtues throughout the multiverse. Without darkness there can be no light, and without struggle there can be no victory. Understanding this, these celestials remain removed from the majority of mortal conflicts, preferring to act as advisors in such situations rather than champions, granting goodly mortals ownership over their own triumphs. In cases where the forces of evil act overtly, however, and intrude upon mortal worlds, azatas are quick to rally to defend such realms and aid those who have no hope of defending themselves.

Azatas generally work together, but their powerful personalities and strong sense of individual freedom often see them disagreeing on how best to handle a particular situation. While both parties have the greater good at heart, these arguments can fester and grow into long-lasting grudges. In cases where a single azata is convinced his way is right, he might even enter a sort of self-imposed exile, abandoning the support of his kin so he can launch a one-azata crusade against the cruelties of the multiverse.

Most azatas originate from the untamable beauty of Elysium, created and nourished by the influx of goodly mortal souls. Like most other outsiders, they cannot reproduce with each other in the mortal fashion, and often tryst with mortals who prove charming and good spirited. Azatas dally frequently with their own kind, being quick to seek out feelings of love, joy, and companionship, but rarely feel bound or exclusive to merely one lover, regardless of its race.

Azatas speak Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal, but can speak with almost any creature because of their truespeech special ability. See creature subtypes for full details on truespeech and other shared azata traits.
