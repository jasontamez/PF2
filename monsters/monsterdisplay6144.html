Where the Plane of Earth borders the Plane of Water, a mixing of the fundamental elements occurs-it is in this borderland that the mud elementals dwell. Scorned by earth and water elementals, mud elementals usually look like vaguely recognizable blobs of mud in the shape of a Material Plane creature, whether a humanoid, an animal, or even an immense insect. The exact density of their muddy bodies varies'some might be composed of silty water, while others are thick, like river clay. Large and powerful mud elementals tend to have worm-like, reptilian, or frog-like forms.

This animate pile of mud seems barely able to maintain the semblance of a humanoid form made of dripping sludge.

An elemental is a being composed entirely from one of the four classical elements: air, earth, fire, or water. An elemental has the following features.<ul><li>Immunity to bleed, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.</li><li>Not subject to critical hits or flanking. Does not take additional damage from precision-based attacks, such as sneak attack.</li><li>Proficient with natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with all simple weapons and any weapons mentioned in its entry.</li><li>Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, as well as all lighter types. Elementals not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Elementals are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.</li><li>Elementals do not breathe, eat, or sleep.</li></ul>Languages Terran

Special Abilities

Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing mud elemental can pass through dirt, gravel, or other loose or porous solid matter as easily as a fish swims through water. It cannot use this ability to pass through a solid barrier such as a stone or brick wall. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing mud elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.

Entrap (Ex) The mud from an elemental's entrap ability can be washed away in 1d3 rounds of immersion in water.
