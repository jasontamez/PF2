Description

Chalicotheriums are massive creatures resembling
sloths with vaguely equine heads and long forelimbs
ending in wickedly sharp claws. While the size and the
claws of these creatures make them seem fierce, they are
generally docile animals and become aggressive only in
the defense of their homes and offspring. They typically
f ight only until the invaders
have fled, but if their young are
threatened, they will not relent
until the attacker is dead, even
if they must pursue it for a great
distance to be sure.

These herbivorous creatures
are generally
found alone
or in pairs,
along with any
of their young.

A typical adult
chalicotherium is
about 10 feet tall at
the shoulder and 12
feet long from nose
to rump, and weighs
14,000 pounds.
