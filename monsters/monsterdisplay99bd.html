Blodeuwedd - Monsters







Blodeuwedd

Clothed in verdant lichen and flowers of broom, meadowsweet, and oak, this shapely maiden has skin of velvety moss and living grass for hair. An eldritch serenity graces her countenance as she approaches, her outstretched, root-like hands brushing the tips of the tallest grass-the wind itself whispers around her feet as patches of clover, heather, and milkweed mark her every step.

Special Abilities

Allergen Aura (Ex) A blodeuwedd exudes an aura of pollen and other irritating allergens that forces living creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 18 Fortitude save or become sickened, coughing and sneezing for 1d6 rounds. Creatures who successfully save cannot be affected by the same blodeuwedd's aura for 24 hours. A blodeuwedd can suppress this aura at will as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Change Shape (Su) A blodeuwedd can assume a single unique humanoid shape or the form of a prairie owl once per day for up to 7 hours as if using the spell polymorph. These hours do not need to be consecutive and a blodeuwedd can return to her normal shape as a free action.

Nature's Infusion (Su) Once per day, while surrounded by any field or fertile plain, a blodeuwedd may infuse herself with borrowed life energy from nearby plants and nutrients in the ground. This ability functions exactly like false life (CL 7th) but lasts only 1 hour.

Verdant Step (Su) Every stride taken by a blodeuwedd causes small plants, grasses, and wildflowers to sprout from the ground, though she can suppress this effect if she desires. While within a plain of tall grass, brush, or similar undergrowth, a blodeuwedd may also step through such plant-life and emerge at any other point within the same field (potentially miles away). This ability functions similar to transport via plants, but a blodeuwedd can only transport herself and does not require a plant equal to her size. This ability is usable three times per day.

Wild Empathy (Ex) This works like the druid's wild empathy class feature, except a blodeuwedd has a +6 racial bonus on the check. A blodeuwedd with druid levels adds this racial modifier to her wild empathy checks.

Description

The mysterious blodeuwedds stand apart from dryads, their tree-bound sisters of the forest, instead watching over the open plains and prairies. They frequently guard the approaches to primeval, fey enclaves as well as various gateways and entry points into the First World-a task they take very seriously. Blodeuwedds hide such regions behind veils of illusion and trickery, quietly observing anyone passing through their lands, and occasionally sending mysterious messages to warn them away or to summon allies that can drive them out. Even when not standing sentinel over a point of otherworldly importance, blodeuwedds find spots of particular natural beauty, transforming such fields-usually only a few acres in size-into sites of unearthly lushness and natural wonder. A typical blodeuwedd stands a little over 5 feet tall, weighs 120 pounds, and may live up to 800 years.

Blodeuwedd Queens

Particularly old and active blodeuwedds' typically the eldest within a region that more than 10 blodeuwedds inhabit-sometimes ascend to the status of queens, gaining additional power and prestige among their own kind. They develop a greater affinity for the lands they rule and attract even more followers. The following adjustments to a standard blodeuwedd represent a young blodeuwedd queen at CR 8. More powerful varieties typically add class levels in druid or sorcerer, both of which are considered favored classes for a blodeuwedd queens.<ul><li>9 Hit Dice</li><li>+2 natural armor</li><li>+4 Strength, +6 Constitution, +6 Charisma</li><li>Additional Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): Always active - endure elements, nondetection; At will - create water, detect animals or plants; 3/day - command plants, move earth, summon nature's ally IV; 1/ day - fire seeds, plant shape II. These spell-like abilities and all others function at CL 11th.</li></ul>
