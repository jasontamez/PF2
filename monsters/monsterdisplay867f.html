Papinijuwari

This imposing one-eyed giant wears fragments of crude armor and

Special Abilities

Devour Disease (Su) As a standard action, a papinijuwari
can suck the life force out of a diseased creature within
30 feet as a ranged touch attack. An affected creature
must immediately succeed at a saving throw against one
disease affecting it or suffer that disease's effect. This
saving throw does not count against the number of saves
required to cure the disease. If it fails the saving throw, the
papinijuwari gains 30 temporary hit points.

Sense Decay (Su) A papinijuwari is under the constant effects
of deathwatch, and can detect creatures currently
infected by disease as if by the scent ability.

Shooting Star (Su) As a full-round action
that provokes attacks of opportunity,
a papinijuwari can fly at a speed of
300 feet. The papinijuwari can use this ability only outside
at night, and must be at least 500 feet above the ground to
do so. It must also hold a lit torch while doing so; the torch
need not be magical, and while held by the papinijuwari, the
torch's flame is not subject to mundane effects that would
extinguish it, such as the wind.

Description

Racing across the skies and preying on diseased humanoids
of all kinds, the merciless, cyclopean papinijuwaris are the
hated cousins of cloud giants. Even evil cloud giants regard
papinijuwaris with disdain, as their hunting practices
offend the more "refined" giants' delicate sensibilities.

Papinijuwaris are agents of death and pestilence,
feeding off of the suffering they help to spread. In some
humanoid cultures, the sight of a shooting star heralds
the arrival of the dreaded papinijuwaris, who invisibly
stalk through settlements at night, hastening the
progression of diseases.

A full-grown papinijuwari stands about 20 feet tall and
weighs nearly 6,000 pounds.
