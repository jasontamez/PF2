Clouds trail from the edges of this graceful, nearly fanciful creature in hypnotizing patterns.

One of the many families of true dragons, the following group of five includes distantly related creatures that either live in the far-flung corners of the Esoteric Planes or deal with obscure matters on the Material Plane.

Age Categories

Many of a true dragon's abilities, attacks, and other statistics improve as the dragon grows older. These increases are divided into 12 age categories-as a dragon ages, its base statistics change as noted on the Dragon Age Categories table on page 87.

Age Category: This is the age category's name.
Age in Years: This is the dragon's actual age.
CR: This column modifies the dragon's base CR.
Size: This column shows the number of size categories by which to increase the dragon's base size, depending on its age (from Tiny to Small, Small to Medium, and so on). A true dragon does not gain the standard increases to ability scores when it achieves a larger size-instead, it gains ability score increases according to its age category, as indicated on the Dragon Ability Scores table.
Hit Dice: This shows how many additional Hit Dice a dragon gains beyond its base HD as it grows. Increases to HD grant extra hit points, feats, and skill ranks as well as increase the dragon's base attack bonus and base save bonuses. A dragon has skill ranks equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per HD. A dragon's increases to ability scores for gaining HD are included in the total ability score increases (see the Dragon Ability Scores table on page 87).
Natural Armor: This shows the amount the dragon's base natural armor bonus increases by age category.
Breath Weapon: Each dragon has a breath weapon (see Combat below) that deals a base amount of damage. This multiplier increases the number of dice of damage dealt by the dragon's breath weapon. For example, a mature adult dragon with a base breath weapon that deals 2d6 points of acid damage would deal 14d6 points of acid damage (because of the x7 multiplier).

Combat

The Dragon Attacks and Speeds table on page 87 lists the attacks a dragon can make and the damage each deals (a dash indicates a dragon of that size lacks that attack). Dragons gain other abilities when they reach specific age categories.

Fly Speed: A dragon's fly speed increases as indicated, according to its size.

Bite: This is a primary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (even though it has more than one attack). A dragon's bite attack has reach as if the creature were one size category larger (+10 feet for Colossal dragons).

Claws: These primary attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon's Strength bonus.

Wings: The dragon can slam foes with its wings, even when flying. Wing attacks are secondary attacks that deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon's Strength bonus.

Tail Slap: The dragon can slap one foe each round with its tail. A tail slap is a secondary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (this is an exception to the normal secondary attack rules).

Crush (Ex): A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = the DC of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush attack each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage + 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.

Tail Sweep (Ex): This allows a Gargantuan or larger dragon to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they were four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus. Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC = the DC of the dragon's breath weapon).

Breath Weapon (Su): Using a breath weapon is a standard action. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds, even if it has more than one breath weapon. A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice. Breath weapons come in two shapes, lines and cones, the areas of which vary with the dragon's size. If a breath weapon deals damage, those caught in the area can attempt saves' typically Reflex saves but sometimes Fortitude saves-to take half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the dragon's HD + the dragon's Constitution modifier). Saves against various breath weapons use the same DC; the type of saving throw is noted in the specific breath weapons' descriptions. A dragon can use its breath weapon when it is grappling or being grappled.

Additional Dragon Rules

All esoteric dragons have the following abilities.

Dragon Senses (Ex): Dragons have darkvision 120 feet and blindsense 60 feet. They see four times as well as a human in dim light and twice as well in normal light.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A dragon's frightful presence has a range equal to 30 feet x the dragon's age category, but otherwise functions as detailed on page 293.

Psychic Magic: Esoteric dragons gain greater psychic skill as they age. An esoteric dragon's caster level for its psychic magic spell-like abilities is equal to its total HD. It has an amount of psychic energy equal to 1/2 its HD when it first gains psychic magic + 2 PE for each age category thereafter. Spells: An esoteric dragon knows and casts psychic spells as a psychic (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 60) of the level indicated in its specific description. Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type.

Damage Reduction: Dragons gain damage reduction as they age, as indicated in each dragon's specific entry. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Immunities (Ex): Every dragon is immune to sleep effects and paralysis effects. In addition, a dragon is immune to one or more additional forms of attack or energy damage no matter what its age is, as given in its specific description.

Spell Resistance (Ex): As dragons grow older, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the specific dragon descriptions. A dragon's spell resistance is equal to 11 + its Challenge Rating.
