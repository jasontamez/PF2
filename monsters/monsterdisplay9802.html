Ogrekin, Stroud Apprentice

Obese and reeking of the swamp, this ogre-tainted woman nonetheless projects an aura of animal magnetism. Her long hair drags in the mud.

Description

Born from the grotesque coupling of green hags and their ogre neighbors deep within the River Kingdoms' tumultuous wilds, the lives of the Stroud Sisters' children are as dismal as their boggy homes. Favoring their fathers' strength but still wielding their mothers' magic, these half-breeds gain what little joy they can by tormenting others, and use their natural inclination for the water to their advantage. By slinking unseen through the marsh and destroying traveling caravans with their spells, they can snatch any survivors away to horrid fates deep within the Ditches. Sometimes a Stroud apprentice lets her prey escape, only to watch the swamp wear her quarry down in a morbid game of cat and mouse that can last for days-and sometimes weeks.

Though these changelings are left to be reared among ogres, denying the call of their hag heritage is virtually impossible for them, and the Stroud Sisters deeply value their children's instinctual loyalty. Though their brood is still only a dozen members strong, the hags grow ever bolder. They encourage their offspring to travel beyond the Ditches to expand their territory, bringing treasures and victims back as gifts for their dear mothers. Rumors of dozens of roaming ogrekin have reached the courts of many nearby realms, inspiring exploratory parties to venture into the marshlands, most of whom are never heard from again.

The result of an unfortunate union between an ogre and a humanoid, the ogrekin (or half-ogre) is cursed with horrific malformations due to its tragic ancestry. Shunned by both parents, ogrekin tend to form unstable clans of their own, often resorting to inbreeding to sustain the collective. While good-natured ogrekin are not entirely unheard of, they are far and few between.


Creating an Ogrekin

"Ogrekin" is an inherited template that can be added to any Medium humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An ogrekin retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as base creature +1 (minimum 2).
Alignment: Usually evil.
Type: The creature's subtype changes to giant.
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +3.
Ability Scores: Str +6, Con +4, Int -2, Cha -2.
Special Qualities and Defenses: An ogrekin gains low-light vision. In addition, ogrekin receive two random deformities-one beneficial and one disadvantageous.

Beneficial Deformities: The ogrekin gains one of these, chosen randomly.
1: Oversized Limb: The ogrekin can wield weapons one size category larger than normal without any penalty and gains a +2 bonus to its Strength.
2: Oversized Maw: The ogrekin gains a bite attack (1d4).
3: Quick Metabolism: The ogrekin gains a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves.
4: Thick Skin: Improve natural armor bonus by +2.
5: Vestigial Limb: Vestigial third arm (can't be used to use items) grants a +4 racial bonus on grapple checks.
6: Vestigial Twin: A malformed twin's head juts out from the ogrekin, providing the ogrekin with all-around vision.

Disadvantageous Deformities: The ogrekin gains one of these, chosen randomly.
1: Deformed Hand: One hand can't wield weapons; -2 penalty on attack rolls with two-handed weapons.
2: Fragile: The ogrekin is particularly frail and gaunt. It loses its +4 racial bonus to Con.
3: Light Sensitive: The ogrekin gains light sensitivity.
4: Obese: The ogrekin takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity (minimum score of 1).
5: Stunted Legs: The ogrekin's base speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum base speed of 5 feet).
6: Weak Mind: The ogrekin's head is huge and misshapen. It gains a -2 penalty on Will saving throws.

Additional Deformities

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9elc?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Monster-Codex">Inner Sea Monster Codex pg. 47</a>

All ogrekin have distinct deformities as a result of their incessant inbreeding and the partially incompatible genetics between ogres and other humanoid races. In addition to the deformities available in Bestiary 2, ogrekin can have any of the new deformities presented below.

Beneficial Deformities

The ogrekin gains one of the following, chosen randomly.

1- Bulging Eye: The ogrekin gains darkvision 60 feet.
2-Enlarged Skull: The ogrekin takes no penalty to Intelligence from the ogrekin template.
3-Gnarled Hands: The ogrekin gains a claw attack. This attack is considered a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. If the ogrekin already possesses a claw attack, it instead gains Improved Natural Attack (claw) as a bonus feat.
4-Grotesque Ears: The ogrekin gains blindsense 10 feet and a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks.
5-Lanky: The ogrekin's natural reach increases by 5 feet.
6-Snout: The ogrekin gains the scent ability.
7-Thick Feet: The ogrekin gains a +4 racial bonus to its CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip combat maneuvers, as well as a +2 bonus to its AC against attacks made as part of a charge action.
8-Vice Grip: The ogrekin gains a +2 racial bonus on disarm and grapple combat maneuver checks and a +4 racial bonus to CMD against disarm and grapple maneuvers.
9-Warty Knuckles: The ogrekin gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.
10-Webbed Fingers: The ogrekin gains a swim speed equal to half its land speed.

Disadvantageous Deformities

The ogrekin gains one of the following, chosen randomly.

1-Atrophied Eyes: The ogrekin gains the light blindness weakness.
2-Bad Eyes: The ogrekin is partially blind. Creatures targeting the ogrekin increase their attack bonuses for flanking to +4, and the ogrekin takes a -2 penalty on all ranged attack rolls against targets more than 30 feet away.
3-Brittle Bones: The ogrekin's bones are malformed and weak. Creatures gain a +4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls to confirm critical hits against the ogrekin.
4-Deformed Feet: The ogrekin can't run and takes a -2 penalty to its CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip combat maneuvers.
5-Distractible: If the ogrekin rolls a natural 1 on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it becomes confused until the end of its next turn.
6-Flaking Skin: The ogrekin reduces the bonus to natural armor granted by the ogrekin template to +1 and gains vulnerability to nonlethal damage.
7-Massive Girth: The ogrekin is treated as being one size category larger when attempting Stealth checks.
8-Offensive Odor: Increase the Charisma penalty imposed by the ogrekin template to -4. Creatures with scent can detect the ogrekin from twice the normal distance.
9-Trusting: The ogrekin takes a -2 penalty on Will saves against mind-affecting effects and a -1 penalty on initiative checks.
10-Twisted Spine: The ogrekin takes a -4 penalty on grapple and trip combat maneuver checks. Standing up from prone requires the ogrekin to take a full-round action.

Half-Ogres

While most ogrekin are the result of an ogre mating with a Medium humanoid, some ogres breed with other giants, especially ash giants (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 126), hill giants, marsh giants (Bestiary 2 129), and trolls. Offspring of such a union are referred to as half-ogres, and are generally outcasts from both societies. Such ogrekin are typically weaker than their pureblooded giant kin, inheriting more of the ogre parent's defects than the giant parent's advantages, and still suffer from beneficial and disadvantageous deformities, the result of the inherent corruption in the ogre parent's limited gene pool.

Creating a Half-Ogre

"Half-ogre" is an inherited template that can be added to any Large humanoid with the giant subtype (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-ogre retains all of the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: HD 10 or fewer, as base creature +0; HD 11 or more, as base creature -1.
Alignment: Usually evil.
Armor Class: If the base creature's natural armor bonus is +4 or less, increase it by 1. If the base creature's natural armor bonus is 6 or greater, decrease it by 1. Otherwise, there's no change.
Ability Scores: Str or Con +2, Cha or Int -2.
Special Qualities and Defenses: A half-ogre receives two random deformities, one beneficial and one disadvantageous, as per the ogrekin template.
