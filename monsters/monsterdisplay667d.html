Special Abilities

Coat Claws (Ex) As a standard action, an ursikka can coat its
pincerlike claws with freezing, viscous saliva. This coating
lasts for 1 minute. Any creature hit by an ursikka's
coated claws or grappled by an ursikka using the
Snatch feat takes an additional 2d6 points of cold
damage (Reflex DC 22 half).
Freezing Saliva (Ex) The saliva that drips from an
ursikka's mouth is sticky as well as cold, causing
creatures to become entangled for 1d4 rounds (Reflex
DC 22 negates). While entangled, creatures take 2d6
points of cold damage each round. An entangled
creature can break free before the end of this
duration by succeeding at a DC 19 Strength
check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the
encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon
or fire damage. Using fire to remove the
saliva damages the entangled creature as
well. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Hibernation (Ex) An ursikka can enter
a prolonged state of hibernation by
surrounding itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon.
While hibernating, an ursikka doesn't need to drink or eat. The
cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to
fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the ursikka
remains unharmed in its hibernation. An ursikka must use its
attacks to break free from its cocoon.
Spit (Ex) As a standard action, an ursikka can spit a 60-foot
line of its saliva. Creatures in the area take 8d6 points of
cold damage and become entangled. A successful DC 22
Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled
condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Ursikka are vicious apex predators that rule vast arctic
territories. Held aloft by four slender legs, on which they
skitter with unsettling speed, ursikka can reach heights
of 25 feet, with a long, lean abdomen accounting for
most of their 20-foot length. Their grasping forearms
each end in a sharp pincer capable of shearing f lesh
from bone, and shaggy fur covers the majority of their
bodies. The ursikka's most unusual trait, however,
is a three-part maw that can open wide enough to
swallow humans whole. Freezing saliva drips constantly
from these gnashing mandibles, injuring and trapping
prey. With only a bestial intellect, ursikka view all smaller
creatures as food, and think nothing of invading and
devouring entire humanoid communities.
