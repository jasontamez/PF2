Description

Butterflies are delicate, brightly colored insects that feed on nectar and other sources of sugar. Moths have the same statistics as butterflies, though they tend to be active at night. The butterfly (or moth) presented here is a particularly large specimen with a wingspan of just over 6 inches, yet it is still completely harmless and awards no XP if slain.

Presented here are the base animal statistics for all of the most commonly used familiars-of course, these statistics can also be used for normal animals as well. Small animals like these use Dexterity to modify Climb and Swim checks.
