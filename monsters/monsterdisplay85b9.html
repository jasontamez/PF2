Description

Bugbears worship in divergent, sometimes contradictory ways, and no one would call their religion "organized." Most of them simply utter occasional thanks to any demon lords whose names they happen to know. A cultist who comes along with a slightly formalized religious spiel and the ability to cast potent spells can sometimes convince other bugbears to follow him into a religious fervor. Cultists revere gods of battle, particularly demon lords. Their rituals vary wildly, and often involve violent blood sacrifices. A small number of especially conceited cultists consider themselves true prophets or living gods.

This dark-furred creature raises a spiked morningstar, its tiny, milk-white eyes glittering with the thrill of the coming kill.
