Special Abilities

Freedom (Sp) Whenever a cerynitis is affected by a spell or effect that would be removed by freedom, she is instantly affected by freedom.

Sacred Grace (Ex) A cerynitis is blessed by her patron deity, allowing her to always act on the surprise round and granting her a sacred bonus to AC and initiative equal to her Charisma bonus.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex) This ability functions as the rogue class feature of the same name.

Unearthly Speed (Ex) When a creature makes a ranged or melee attack against a cerynitis, targets her with an ability, or includes her in the area of effect of an ability, the cerynitis can move up to half her speed as if she had readied an action to move. If she moves at all, this foils ranged and melee attacks; if she moves out of the area of effect, she avoids an area of effect ability; if she moves out of range of the targeted effect, she avoids a targeted ability. Once she uses this ability, a cerynitis can't use it again for 1 round. Each use of this ability counts as a move action for the purpose of triggering Lightning Stance. A cerynitis can't use unearthly speed to avoid an attack or ability if she is not aware of the attack or ability, and she cannot use this ability at all if she is rendered immobile or if she bears a rider.

Description

Cerynitises are rare golden does with magnificent metallic horns and hooves. These solitary creatures are born to ordinary deer with the blessings of a deity, typically a deity of nature or the hunt. Cerynitises are wise and placid creatures, but humanoids hunt them nonetheless for their valuable horns and pelts (worth 1,000 gp together), or for the sheer challenge of catching the uncatchable. Though heroes of nature occasionally dream of having a cerynitis mount, none have yet succeeded at gaining the service of such a prized steed. Though she is likely to run away before a conversation can begin, a cerynitis is willing to share her wisdom with those who prove they do not mean her harm.

A typical cerynitis measures 10 feet long from head to tail and weighs 350 pounds.
