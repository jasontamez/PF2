Special Abilities

Ley Swim (Su) Vishaps are fundamentally attuned to ley lines. As a full-round
action while within reach of a vishapakar standing stone
that is placed on a ley line, a vishap can swim the currents
of any ley line attached to that vishakapar at a rate of 10
miles per round (crossing to a different plane takes 10
rounds). This is a teleportation effect. The vishap can sense
the exact shape and length of the ley line, and knows
exactly where each vishapakar along the ley line is. In
addition, the vishap automatically knows the status (as per
the spell) of each living creature along the ley line's path or
attuned to the ley line. A vishap can end its ley swim only
at a vishapakar, though it can travel along other ley lines
that connect with its current ley line.

Poison (Ex) Bite or poisoned blood-contact or injury; save Fort
DC 30; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con; cure
2 consecutive saves.

Poisoned Blood (Ex) Any creature that comes into contact
with a vishap's blood is subjected to the dragon's poison.
A creature that deals melee damage to a vishap must
succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save to avoid being exposed
to the poison, and an attacker using a natural weapon is
exposed automatically.

Spells (Sp) A vishap casts spells as a 15th-level psychic.

Vishapakar Affinity (Sp, Su) A vishap automatically succeeds
at any attempt to attune itself to a ley line if it makes that
attempt while adjacent to a vishapakar. It treats the effects
of any such ley line as if the ley line were 5 caster levels
higher. By concentrating as a standard action, a vishap can
view the surroundings of a vishapakar on one of its attuned
ley lines as per greater scrying.

Description

Vishaps think of themselves as guardians of the ley
lines that connect the life forces of the Material Plane to
one another. Like all dragons, vishaps claim expansive
territories, but these territories often make little
geographical sense to others-a single vishap might
claim unconnected areas on different hemispheres of a
planet, for example, and yet multiple vishaps sometimes
coexist within mere miles of each other with no apparent
animosity. To those attuned to the occult mysteries of ley
lines, however, the vishaps' territorial borders are clear.
Each vishap claims one or more networks of ley lines,
which may stretch for thousands of miles (or even across
galaxies), and sometimes overlap with each other without
ever touching. A vishap's first priority is the integrity of its
ley line network, so any corruption of a ley line draws the
attention of the vishap that cares for it.

Vishaps claim only small physical territories in places
where their ley lines coincide with interesting geography.
In these places, vishaps make psychic contact with
intelligent creatures nearby, encouraging them to create
standing stones called vishapakars. A vishap can't place
a vishapakar on its own, but the presence of a vishapakar
on a ley line allows the vishap a great deal of control
over that ley line. Evil or less diplomatic vishaps often
travel to these desirable locations to intimidate the local
people into appeasing the dragons with standing stones.
Vishapakars can stand for thousands of years, even as the
ley lines that they once marked drift and change course,
so a vishap must return to each vishapakar periodically,
entreating (or forcing) locals to create new vishapakars
on the ley lines' new locations. At particularly ancient
locations, it is possible to map the gradual drift of ley
lines by the age of the nearby vishapakars.

Vishaps become deeply attached to their ley line
networks over their millennia-long life spans, and can
live peacefully alongside other vishaps with nearby
networks. When ley lines drift and converge, however, it
often results in a mortal duel. Sometimes this happens
as a corporeal battle in the skies of a planet, or between
the dragons while in their ethereal forms. Most
commonly, vishaps engaged in mortal combat for
control of converging ley lines meet each other
in elaborate psychic duels. These duels can last
for years, and often spill over into the Material
Plane, with each vishap subtly manipulating the
creatures and locations along the converging ley
lines in a proxy war to defeat its opponent.

Vishaps keep their treasure hoards, like their
territories, in strange places, hidden in eddies of
psychic energy along their favorite ley lines. A vishap's
hoard might be physically scattered across dozens of
planes, though to the vishap each cache is only minutes
away from the others. A vishap favors items of psychic
signif icance, so one is as likely to find a mundane
wooden spoon that belonged to a powerful occultist
or the skull of a famous psychic in a vishap's hoard
as a magical sword or mountains of gold.

Vishaps procreate only once during their lives, as
tending to their ley lines takes priority over almost any
biological imperative. When a vishap is finally ready to
mate, it commits its form wholly to the ley line network,
drifting listlessly along the psychic currents. Inevitably,
it meets with some other drifting vishap, and the two
consciousnesses merge, exploding in a spray of psychic
force. The resulting motes of ethereal energy scatter across
the universe, slowly drifting back toward each other and
forming eggs, which sometimes drift along ley lines for
millennia before hatching a young, ethereal vishap that
awakens to full consciousness upon hatching.

A fully grown vishap is 70 feet from head to tail and
weighs 60,000 pounds.
