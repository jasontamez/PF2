Robots are intelligent constructs created by advanced scientific means. They have the following traits, unless otherwise noted. <ul><li>Difficult to Create (Ex): Robots are crafted via complex methods hidden and well guarded. A robot does not have a construction entry. </li><li>Intelligent: Robots are intelligent, and thus have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice. Unless otherwise indicated for a specific robot, all robots have Intelligence scores of 10. The following are class skills for robots: Climb, Disable Device, Fly, Knowledge (all), Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. </li><li>Vulnerable to Critical Hits: Whenever a robot takes extra damage from a critical hit, it must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If the robot succeeds at the save, it is staggered for 1 round. The robot remains immune to all other sources of the stunned condition. </li><li>Vulnerable to Electricity: Robots take 150% as much damage as normal from electricity attacks.</li></ul> The following special abilities apply to some robots, but are not universal to all types of robot. <ul><li>Combined Arms (Ex): When making a full attack, a robot with the combined arms special attack can make all its melee natural weapon attacks plus its ranged integrated weapon attacks. </li><li>Force Field (Ex): A robot might have a force field that sheathes it in a thin layer of energy that grants a number of temporary hit points (typically 5 x the robot's CR). All damage dealt to a robot with an active force field is deducted from these temporary hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. A force field has fast healing equal to the robot's CR, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.
&emsp;Format: force field (55 hp, fast healing 5); Location: hp. </li><li>Integrated Weaponry (Ex): A robot that has a technological weapon built into its body treats it as a natural weapon and not a manufactured weapon, and can't make iterative attacks with it. An integrated weapon can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as <a href="spelldisplayedfd.html?ItemName=magic%20weapon">magic weapon</a> or sunder attempts), but can't be harvested for use outside of the robot's body once the robot is destroyed. A robot is always proficient with its integrated weapons. Integrated ranged weapons don't provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat. </li><li>Laser Weapons (Ex): A laser weapon emits beams of intensely focused light waves. Laser attacks resolve as touch attacks and deal fire damage. A laser can pass through force fields and force effects like a <a href="spelldisplay5dac.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20force">wall of force</a> without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.</li></ul>
