Special Abilities

Energized Maul (Su) As a swift action, an Axial monitor can add the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay10ea.html?ItemName=Axiomatic">axiomatic</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay0b68.html?ItemName=Flaming">flaming</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplayc7e5.html?ItemName=Frost">frost</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a>, or <a href="magicweaponsdisplaye500.html?ItemName=Thundering">thundering</a> weapon special ability to its slam attack for 1 round, but it cannot add more than one ability at a time.

Interrogate (Su) When an Axial monitor questions a creature that is helpless or pinned, it can compel the creature to answer its questions truthfully unless the creature succeeds at a DC 23 Will save. A creature that fails its save is affected as though subject to <a href="spelldisplayacca.html?ItemName=zone%20of%20truth">zone of truth</a>, except that the creature must answer questions if it is able and cannot refuse to answer or answer evasively. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same Axial monitor's interrogate ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Tripartite Assault (Ex) When it makes a full attack, an Axial monitor can choose to make a full attack with one weapon and secondary attacks with its tentacle and slam, or it can choose to make a single attack with each weapon it wields, including its tentacle and slam attacks, with no penalties to its attack rolls for fighting with multiple weapons.

Watchful Faces (Ex) An Axial monitor can make three additional attacks of opportunity in a round, one for each head, although it can make no more than a single attack for any given opportunity.

Description

The Eternal City of Axis lies at the center of the multiverse, holding the very fabric of reality in some semblance of order through the constant calculations of the axiomite Godmind. Yet even a city of order such as Axis, open as it is to visitors from across the planes, must deal with its own internal law and order on a daily basis. The Axial monitors are tasked with preventing disturbances of order and, when crimes do occur, investigating them to bring the perpetrators to justice.

Each Axial monitor has the same unusual form: its large, hairless head bears three faces set equidistantly around it, each expression the picture of bland serenity. These faces appear roughly humanoid but are completely smooth, without contours for a brow, nose, or mouth, as though its faces were painted on canvas. The creature's triangular torso has three shoulders, each with two powerful arms. Two pairs of its arms are humanoid, while the third set is mismatched, with one a long, undulating tentacle and the other an articulated limb of banded iron ending in a maul-like head. Below its waist, the creature's body divides into a tripod of legs, each ending in a long foot.

Axial monitors only attack those presenting a disturbance to Axis's order, whether through the commission of a crime or another civil malfeasance. They call for surrender before a fight and prefer to subdue opponents rather than slay them. Their mandate is to bring prisoners into their dispatch stations so they can be examined and interrogated, and the reasons for their disturbance identified and measured in formal reports. These reports are provided directly to the Godmind, which calculates the mathematically ideal method to counteract and prevent any such future disturbances. After incarceration and calculation, an offender is either set free or transferred to one of the city's rehabilitative prisons under escort by Axial monitors. Although they follow this same process for nearly all creatures, the Axial monitors show no mercy or leniency to proteans and always attack these embodiments of disorder with lethal force on sight.

Axial monitors are 12 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.

Ecology

Axial monitors maintain a low profile unless in pursuit of a criminal or when investigating a crime. The city is so orderly than many visitors to Axis-and indeed, some residents-never see an Axial monitor or know they exist. Their rarity engenders several mysteries about their creation and their purpose. It is unclear whether Axial monitors are created by axiomites, are created from axiomites, or are incarnations formed by Axis itself to maintain its mathematically perfect conceptions of peace and order. Axial monitors do not seem to be a distinct species because they do not procreate or age. Axial monitors have never been observed to eat, drink, or sleep, and some speculate that their fortified dispatch stations must be where the creatures rest. The only non-monitors allowed inside these dispatch stations are criminals and rare axiomite specialists, but they are restricted to chambers near a station's arched entrance. No one, except perhaps the Godmind itself, knows precisely how many Axial monitors there are, which lends some credence to the theory that they are generated directly by the Godmind or the city itself as need dictates.

Habitat and Society

Inevitables served both as the original law enforcement in the city of Axis and as its shock troops in the first war between law and chaos when the Outer Planes were young. However, as inevitables have expanded their role to enforcing the will of law across the multiverse and to combating chaos in all its incarnations, Axial monitors assumed many of the inevitables' former law-enforcement duties within the city.

Axial monitors keep the peace in Axis in as harmonious a way as possible, and are never seen outside of Axis. They do not patrol the streets of the Eternal City, as peace officers in other cities do, but are dispatched directly by the Godmind. An Axial monitor's unflappable countenance and unusual appearance-bordering between bizarre and comical-is off-putting and alien to most creatures. Few creatures expect sympathy or kinship from the strange-looking Axial monitors, and it is likely that the Godmind purposely calculated their manner and appearance for precisely this effect.
