Description

A still untainted fey in the northern stretch of the
Shudderwood, Amalya is a bastion of nature among a
perverse land, where denizens are beginning to succumb
to the Worldwound's demonic hordes. To survive, she
has formed a particularly close bond with her natural
surroundings. She's studied the earth's struggle to survive
against the Worldwound's onslaught; this scholarly
curiosity has granted her powerful spells that she uses
to protect herself, her tree, and the forest's remaining
natural creatures. Given the danger she faces daily, Amalya
is better at hiding than most dryads-however, the
prevalence of half-fiends and other unspeakably abhorrent
creatures also makes her a pragmatist of the highest order.
She allies with like-minded adventurers who can stave off
these threats more readily than others do of her kind.
