Description



Fiendish Dire Boar Servant
hp 42 (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 36, 294)
When ghouls marshal themselves into organized groups, it is ghoul commanders who shoulder the responsibility of leadership and command. In "civilized" ghoul cities and nations, ghoul commanders serve as an elite officer class, directing and commanding units of more common ghouls in military maneuvers and on excursions. While they receive their orders from ghouls higher up the chain of command, ghoul commanders are responsible for translating those orders into concrete tactics, and enjoy great autonomy on the battlefield-so long as their strategies succeed, at least.
