Special Abilities

Earth Mastery (Ex) A shaitan gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and a +2 bonus on opposed Strength-based checks if both it and its foe are touching the ground. It takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls against airborne or waterborne opponents.

Metalmorph (Su) As a standard action, a shaitan may touch a single metal object of no more than 10 pounds and transform it into any other metal for 1 day.

Stone Curse (Su) If a shaitan wins a bull rush check by 5 or more and pushes its target into a stone barrier, the target must make a DC 19 Reflex save or be forced into the barrier as if the target had cast meld into stone until the victim makes a successful DC 19 Fortitude save as a full-round action to exit the stone. The save DCs are Strength-based.

Stone Glide (Su) This functions as the earth elemental's earth glide ability, except the shaitan can move through stone, dirt, crystal, or metal.

Description

Shaitans are boastful and proud genies from the Plane of Earth with flesh of metal, gems, or stone. A shaitan stands about 11 feet tall and weighs roughly 5,000 pounds.

Some shaitans are noble. Often called pashas, they have 18 Hit Dice and gain the spell-like ability earthquake, usable once per day, as well as the ability to grant up to three wishes per day (nongenies only). A noble shaitan's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 18th. Noble shaitans are CR 13.
