Description

Orang-pendaks are a rare offshoot of the sasquatch
species that dwells in remote mountainous jungles.
Elusive and shy, they are rarely seen by other races. Given
their friendship with apes (gibbons and orangutans in
particular) and their hunched posture and shaggy fur-
ranging from tawny or reddish to dark brown or black-
they are often mistaken for those beasts at a distance.
Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and
fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar
appearance, the species are not closely related.

Within their remote holds, Orang-pendaks cluster
together into seminomadic tribes, hunting and gathering
in a region until food and game becomes scarce, then
moving on to the next area. Many tribes follow a regional
pattern to this migration, allowing parts of the jungle to
repopulate and gathering only enough substance so as
not to disrupt the land's ability to recoup the losses.

Orang-pendaks range from 3 to 5 feet tall as adults,
weighing up to 150 pounds, and they are quite strong for
their size. Orang-pendaks are largely herbivorous, but
sometimes hunt with spears, clubs, and bolas.
