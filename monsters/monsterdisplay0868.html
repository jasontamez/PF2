Grendler Red-Chains - Monsters







Grendler Red-Chains

Shards of broken manacles, links of chain, and iron flails are
imbedded in this hideous, human-sized man's ruddy flesh.
Rivulets of congealing blood run from its soaked cap down its
mangled face and neck, soaking its tangled white beard; in its
arms looms a rusty but clearly sharp scythe.

Description

It's said the latent suffering in Varisia's Hollow
Mountain-where Thassilonian slaves long ago carved
out a labyrinth of intricate corridors-not only attracted
Grendler Red-Chains but helped him grow to a size
considered monstrous for a redcap. The height of a short
man, Grendler Red-Chains stalks the mountain's tunnels
with aplomb, terrorizing adventurers and the complex's
denizens alike with his wicked scythe and spiked boots.
Perhaps because of his larger size, he heals faster than
most redcaps; he enjoys self-mutilation almost as much
as he enjoys dipping his cap in his victims' blood. Over
the years, Grendler Red-Chains has culled bits of chains
and shackles from the corpses of long-dead slaves and
embedded them into his own flesh, both to terrify his
enemies and to fortify his defenses.
