Special Abilities

Desert Dweller (Ex) A shissah feels at home in the desert and does not treat light rubble or sand as difficult terrain. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks in the desert, and it treats hot temperatures as one category less for the purposes of heat danger. Thus, a shissah does not suffer unduly in very hot conditions, treating severe heat as very hot and extreme heat as severe heat.

Desert Senses (Ex) A shissah is familiar with mirages and gains a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against mirage effects and against effects that cause the dazzled condition. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks in deserts.

Easily Trained (Ex) A shissah is unusually quick to pick up tricks and animal training. Anyone attempting to train a shissah gains a +2 bonus on her Handle Animal checks. A shissah can learn an additional 2 tricks beyond what an animal of its intelligence can normally be taught.

Description

Shissahs are smaller and seem more delicate than most horses, but their fragile appearance belies their hardiness. They can travel for weeks on minimal water rations and survive on desert scrub and even locusts if necessary. Their large, wide-set eyes, which are surrounded by a thin ring of black, hairless skin, enable them to see despite the glare of the desert sun. Their wide foreheads, tapering to a slender muzzle, indicate their great intelligence. Their high-arched tails are often taken as a sign of their fiery spirit.

Shissahs come in a wide range of colors, and they are often used to refine the lines of other breeds and lend them greater intelligence and bravery. Few leave the hands of Keleshite owners, for a shissah is no mere mount, but a fierce and loyal partner.

Shissah Companions

A shissah companion starts with slightly less natural armor than a typical horse, but it is easier to train; while it doesn't advance until 7th level (unlike a typical horse, which advances at 4th level), the superior boons it gains in the end often make the wait worthwhile.
