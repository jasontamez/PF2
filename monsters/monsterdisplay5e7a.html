Description

Auwaz couatls are a variety of couatl known for helping those who are lost find their way back to safety. They are particularly known for traveling around the oceans of Golarion to help sailors and other travelers lost at sea. Many sailors claim that they owe their lives to an auwaz couatl, though these same sailors warn that living a particularly vile life will instead draw an auwaz couatl's ire. An auwaz couatl often prefers that evil beings remain lost, and it actively works to ensure such creatures remain lost for as long as possible. A typical auwaz couatl is 8 feet long with a wingspan of 12 feet, and weighs 800 pounds.

Ecology

Auwaz couatls are the most commonly known couatls across Golarion, at least among those people who live near coasts. An auwaz couatl's scales are a light gray with subtle light blue and green markings. Their feathers are typically blue and green, with hints of light yellow reminiscent of the sun. The coloring resembles the waters of the oceans, and the exact coloring of an auwaz couatl tends to vary depending on which body of water the couatl frequents-each major sea and ocean seems to have its own distinct auwaz markings and colorations. The sound of an auwaz couatl's wings resembles that of a gentle ocean breeze. This makes it hard to detect their approach, and many sailors tend to utter short blessings whenever they encounter a calm, compliant breeze, just in case an auwaz couatl is nearby.

Each auwaz couatl knows the location of every settlement on the edge of its waters and is happy to share this knowledge with those it views favorably. Those who draw an auwaz couatl's suspicion sometimes receive inaccurate knowledge, ending up at a settlement a few hundred miles away from their intended destination. An auwaz couatl usually gives this misinformation to allow it time to follow the travelers and determine whether they are dangerous, correcting its original directions only if the travelers appear to be good-hearted. When dealing with evil travelers, an auwaz couatl usually points them toward subtle dangers such as troubled waters, reefs, and other oceanic dangers. The creature won't follow these travelers and is content with letting the ocean determine their fates.

Auwaz couatls have moderate control over the weather, calling forth winds and storms as they feel necessary. They use this power to aid the travel of those they are guiding home, summoning strong winds to make the journeys of sailing ships shorter. Similarly, if an auwaz couatl encounters a sinking ship, it uses its powers to grant survivors the ability to breathe water and personally guides these victims to safety. This power also allows an auwaz couatl to work against evil travelers, making their journeys difficult and even calling on lightning storms to strike ships when necessary.

Auwaz couatls have the shortest lives of all couatls, living only about a century at most, and most have life spans equivalent to those of humans. Due to their flighty nature, they rarely take the time to meet with others of their kind, though they do gather once every few years to reproduce, laying several eggs each. Its uncertain how auwaz couatls know the exact time to gather, though many believe they read a message in the stars left behind by their cousins, the <a href="monsterdisplayf484.html?ItemName=Mix%20Couatl">mix couatls</a>.

Habitat and Society

Auwaz couatls live roving, independent lives that allow them to travel all across Golarion. Although most auwaz couatls live near the seas and oceans of Golarion, some prefer to stay inland and help those lost in forests or mountains. An auwaz couatl typically sticks to its home in its younger years, but it eventually travels the world through its adult life before returning. Auwaz couatls tend to avoid each other and keep out of each other's affairs, except in times of peril. In these cases, an auwaz couatl uses a particular call, perceptible only to other couatls, to warn of danger. During these fraught times, auwaz couatls travel in packs, especially to protect the younger members of their kind.

As they are generally good-natured and curious, many auwaz couatls take time to speak with any travelers they find, often flying above ships and conversing with those on board. These conversations usually involve current events, as auwaz couatls prefer to keep updated so as to not send travelers to dangerous locales, but they can also include artistic and philosophical discussions. Some auwaz couatls are quite fond of humorous stories and like to spend hours telling such tales, especially if there are children among the travelers. The sight of an auwaz couatl above a ship serves as a signal to others that the ship is protected, so many ships fly kites in the shape of auwaz couatls in hopes of giving marauders pause.

Auwaz couatls are particularly fond of children, as they find kinship in their innocence. They are more than happy to comfort distressed children and guide them home. In particularly dire situations, or ones where a child may be too far from home to safely travel, an auwaz couatl will carry the child on its back and fly it to safety. An auwaz couatl typically has a different approach with children who have run away from home; the auwaz couatl takes time to speak with the child and learn her reasons for running away. In some cases, the child seeks to escape a troubled life and the auwaz couatl helps guide the child to a new home. In other cases, the auwaz couatl convinces the child to return home but encourages her to cultivate the wanderlust in her heart. Such children tend to grow into adventurers and travel the world years later.
