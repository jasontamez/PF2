Description

Along the western border of the Mwangi Expanse, across Rechiend's Plains, rumors abound of an especially old chupacabra with wings that sprout from his back. Years have added swiftness and cunning to the beast the locals call "Papa Chupar."

Elders remember tales of Papa Chupar as far as 30 years back, an unusually long time for a chupacabra to live. Some tell a folk tale about a lazy, greedy youth who preferred begging off his neighbors rather than working for an honest living. One day, the youth reluctantly agreed to herd goats in exchange for food when no one would give him a meal for free. Rather than drive the goats to the pasture, the youth let them graze in a nearby graveyard. Outraged at this insolent act, the spirits of the buried ancestors cursed the youth. He took the form of a chupacabra, doomed to forever prey on animals for sustenance, shunned and feared by his former neighbors. The locals say that only death will free the boy's spirit, but Papa Chupar is far too quick and clever to be easily slain.

Those who have spotted Papa Chupar describe a creature almost 7 feet from nose to tail, standing 5-1/2 feet tall. Gray-green hide thicker than an ordinary chupacabra's seems to draw shadows around it, and two leathery, scaled wings stretch out from the beast's spine. Papa Chupar's eyes glow crimson, and his talons and spines are a deep burgundy. The hilly terrain affords cover that Papa Chupar takes full advantage of.

Unlike most chupacabras, Papa Chupar is willing to attack adult humanoids and often targets lone travelers, or even travelers in pairs. The chupacabra is particularly clever and vicious, and studies prey for at least an hour before striking. If possible, Papa Chupar prefers to sneak into camps at night and drain blood from sleeping victims. Though a victim's panicked screams wake the whole camp, Papa Chupar easily takes to the sky, invigorated, and flies off. If a watch is set, Papa Chupar has learned to flush small animals from their nests to create a distraction, hoping to lure the guard away and leave sleeping travelers vulnerable to his attack.

Papa Chupar has a wide territory, and homesteads from Bloodcove to Nantambu take extra care guarding their herds at night.
