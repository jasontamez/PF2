Kallas Devil

Growing from the back of a horselike beast is the torso of a sea
hag with grossly elongated arms and large, clawed hands. Its
tangled web of stringy hair does not hide the disturbing fact that
the hideous creature has no skin, and is built of gore and viscera.

Special Abilities

Evil Eye (Su) Three times per day, the Kallas Devil can cast
its dire gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The
target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be staggered
as a strange nebulous distress and a gnawing sense of
impending doom plague the victim. If the Kallas Devil uses
its evil eye on someone already afflicted by this curse,
the victim must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be
overwhelmed with fright and collapse into a comatose
state for 3 days. Each day that passes, the comatose victim
must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or perish. The
evil eye is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

Description

This nuckelavee is even more hideous than
usual because its torso is that of a sea hag,
whose skinless head somehow retains a mess
of hairlike knotted seaweed that flails behind
it as the creature gallops furiously across
the land. The creature dwells in Kallas Lake
at the southern tip of the River Kingdoms and
terrorizes the nearby town of Riverton, where
humans and half-elves survive by fishing and
guiding travelers along the branches of the
Sellen. It mighty hooves also pound along the
riverbank as far west as Tymon and as far east
as the Creeperwood, bringing plague and death
to those who despoil the waters.

The influence of its hag torso drives the beast
to want to clothe itself in skin. Other nuckelavees
keep trophies of their kills, but the Kallas Devil
flays its quarry to create a patchwork cloak of flesh
that it drapes over its upper body. The husk of skin
tears easily, so the devil requires a steady supply of
victims to maintain its appearance. Some villages that
suffer under its vengeance try to appease it by staking
out criminals and other undesirables for its pleasure.
The fey terror takes these sacrif ices but shows no favor
to its supplicants.
