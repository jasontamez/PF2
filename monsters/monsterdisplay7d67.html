Special Abilities

Disease (Ex) Scarlet Tetanus: Iron feather or wing-injury; save Fort DC 23; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Dex damage and 1 Con drain. Each time a victim takes Dexterity damage from scarlet tetanus, there is a 50% chance its jaw muscles and joints stiffen, preventing speech and the use of spells with verbal components for 24 hours; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Flesh to Iron (Sp) This spell-like ability functions as flesh to stone, save that it transforms the victim into iron, not stone. A victim turned to iron cannot be restored by stone to flesh, but break enchantment, polymorph any object, and similar spells can restore such a victim.

Iron Feathers (Ex) With a flick of its wings, a rust devil can hurl a volley of four razor-sharp iron feathers at up to four targets as a standard action (make an attack roll for each feather). All targets must be within 30 feet of each other. This attack has a range increment of 40 feet, and threatens a critical hit on a result of 19-20. The rust devil's Strength modifier applies to the damage dealt by the feathers, as if the feathers were thrown weapons. The rust devil's feathers replenish instantly, allowing it to use this attack at will.

Metallic (Ex) A rust devil's iron flesh makes it susceptible to rust attacks, such as those by a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.

Slashing Wings (Ex) A rust devil's wing attacks are primary attacks (except when it wields a manufactured weapon), and threaten a critical hit on a 19-20; most rust devils enhance this range to 17-20 with the Improved Critical feat.

Vainglorious Whispers (Su) As a swift action, a rust devil can plant seeds of delusional pride in an adjacent target's mind by whispering to it. The target can resist the influence of these whispers with a successful DC 21 Will saving throw. On a failed save, the victim becomes overly confident in its abilities while in fact becoming less accomplished overall. The victim gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects but takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, caster level checks, and skill checks. The victim cannot use the withdraw action, fight defensively, cast spells defensively, take the total defense action, or use healing magic or effects on itself. It can still accept healing from other sources, but must attempt saving throws to resist the effect if allowed. This is a mind-affecting, sonic, language-dependent effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

A rust devil lives to sow the seeds of complacency, pride, and callous cynicism in the hearts of mortals. Also known as ferrugons, rust devils rarely attack first except when rising to defend buildings or other objects they have taken it upon themselves to protect. Rather than resorting to bloodshed, a rust devil instead seeks to bolster a mortal's pride and to convince him to undertake works of art, construction, or craft that are likely well beyond the mortal's skill. Nothing pleases a rust devil more than to see a mortal attempt something grand, fail spectacularly, and fall into a morass of depression, selfloathing, and jealousy for the rest of his life.

In combat, a rust devil uses walls of iron to shape the battlefield to its advantage, and prefers to remain adjacent to foes so it can make full attacks on them and whisper in their ears. Against foes who wield weapons, rust devils almost always use Greater Sunder to damage weapons and foes alike. If faced with foes of particularly striking appearances (often those with a Charisma score of 15 or higher), a rust devil is likely to use its flesh to iron spell-like ability, then cast shrink item on the resulting statue to keep it as a decoration for its lair.

A rust devil stands only 5 feet tall but weighs 900 pounds, because of its supernaturally dense metallic flesh.

Ecology

Rust devils are forged from the souls of the damned who caused pain and suffering through the application of their arts or crafts during their mortal lives. Such petitioners are often dipped repeatedly in vats of molten iron, building up layer after layer of new "flesh" that is then chiseled and forged anew by diabolic artisans.

Habitat and Society

Rust devils are most commonly found in Dis, where they see themselves as guardians and caretakers of the city's iron buildings. Indeed, ferrugons often refer to themselves as the Gardeners of Iron, and view their role more as tenders and cultivators rather than actual architects.

Bloodbond Insights

Rust devils are particularly fond of forging infernal contracts that encourage mortals to attempt hubristic and difficult feats of art or architecture. For every mortal who accepts such a contract and crafts a masterpiece, dozens fail to achieve success and spiral into self-loathing and jealousy, priming their immortal souls for damnation in hellfire. For more on infernal contracts, see page 62.

Bloodbond Insight - CR 12

XP 19,200
Devil rust devil (ferrugon)
Creation Time 1d4 weeks
Benefit The contracted mortal gains a +4 profane bonus on Craft and Profession checks, and gains the ability to use major creation once per day as a spell-like ability. When the contracted mortal crafts any magic or technological item, the cost of creating the item is reduced by 5%.
Payment The contracted mortal must allow the rust devil to harvest a single rib from his torso; the method of extraction is particularly invasive and painful, resulting in 2 points of Constitution drain. If the mortal ever allows this Constitution drain to be healed, his soul is damned to Hell upon his death.

Research

Description Infernal contracts created by rust devils incorporate complex diagrams and sketches as examples to either help explain or obfuscate the contract's contents.
Complexity 34
Specialized Skills Craft (any), Knowledge (engineering), Profession (any that produces physical goods)
kp 36
Hidden Condition (18 kp) Once per month, the rust devil can use enter image on any object created by the contracted mortal that depicts a visage of any type. While this effect is active, the rust devil can use its spell-like abilities through the image on any target within range and sight.
Termination Clause (0 kp) If the mortal harvests a replacement rib from a donor of the same race as himself and then allows this rib to be used as an additional material component during the casting of a regenerate spell cast by the creature from whom the rib was harvested, the contract is terminated.

Masters of corruption and despoilers of purity, devils seek to destroy all things good and drag mortal souls back with them to the depths of Hell.

As the most numerous fiendish occupants of Hell, the various forms of devils are well catalogued by diabolists. Most are known by two names: an evocative title given to the fiends by commoners and folklore, and an obscure, ancient designation spoken by the servants of Hell and those who would seek to deal with the damned.

Born from the foulest of mortal souls-their personalities and memories long since scoured by millennia of torment-would-be devils rise from the masses of suffering souls as lemures, revolting beings of mindless evil potentiality. Only through continued centuries of torture or by the edicts of more powerful devils do these least of devilkind rise to become deadlier fiends, graduating through a pain-wracked metamorphosis dictated by their masters or the infernal whims of Hell's semi-sentient layers. While fiendish lords wield transformation into greater or lesser forms as both prize and punishment, some devils spontaneously rise from particularly evil souls long trapped upon an infernal layer. Thus, although the various diabolical breeds possess recognizable abilities and hold generalized rankings in the great infernal hierarchy, a devil's type alone does not always correspond to a specific tenure of torment or place in the infernal chain of command.

Devils fill the nine layers of Hell, though certain fiends are more common on specific layers than others, their specialized duties or fealty to individual archdevils drawing them to one torturous domain more than others. Although the various types of devils tend to specialize in unique forms of depravity or temptation, the hierarchies of Hell are not without flexibility for uncommon individual talents. Thus, particularly watchful hamatulas might join the ranks of Phlegethon's bone devil inquisitors, while veteran barbazus might serve among the pit fiends of Nessus.

Beyond the pits of Hell, devils often travel to the Material Plane at the summons of evil spellcasters. Quick to bargain and willing to serve mortals to assure their damnation, devils ever obey the letter of their agreements, but serve the whims of Hell foremost. Thus, even the least of devilkind might come to the Material Plane intent on further corrupting souls, cleverly escaping the bonds of their contracts to indulge their own plots, or to further the unspeakable goals of the archdevils of Hell.

The Ranks of Devilkind

Diabolists speak often of the rankings of Hell, the distinctions made between devils that distinguish the foot soldiers from the commanders of Hell's armies. While such divisions mean little to most mortals-a devil being a deadly foe in any incarnation-the hierarchies and nuances of Hell's society carry distinctions vital to the survival of any who would commune with devils. What distinguishes a breed of devils above or below others is more than a matter of brawn, with several cunning types of fiend holding priority over their fundamentally stronger brethren. While a devil's station does not mean it can instantly command every other devil of inferior standing, it does imply which fiends might serve their brethren or hold influence over others.

Below these are the devil races themselves, from the lordly and malevolent pit fiends all the way down to the lowly, malformed lemure.

The Infernal Hierarchy

Listed here, from the absolute weakest devils to the lords of Hell, is the most basic hierarchy of the infernal realm's best-known denizens.

Least Devils: imps, lemures
Lesser Devils: bearded devils (barbazus), erinyes, barbed devils (hamatulas), bone devils (osyluths)
Greater Devils: horned devils (cornugons), ice devils (gelugons), pit fiends
