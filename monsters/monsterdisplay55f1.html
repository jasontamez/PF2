Special Abilities

Reflexive Strike (Ex) A styracosaurus can make three additional attacks of opportunity each round-combined with its bonus Combat Reflexes feat, this allows the dinosaur to make up to five of these attacks of opportunity per round. The dinosaur makes these attacks with its horned crest, but they are treated as normal gore attacks.

Description

The styracosaurus is a bulky dinosaur with a solid frame and a very distinctive skull-a horned frill extends back from its head, protecting its neck and serving as a highly effective natural weapon that allows it to make attacks of opportunity. It is notorious for its ill temper, savagely attacking any creature that it perceives as a threat or even as an irritant.

A styracosaurus is 18 feet long and weighs nearly 3 tons.
