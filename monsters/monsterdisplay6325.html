Description

Half-fiends are creatures heavily tainted with demonic, infernal, or other evil power.

Creating a Half-Fiend

"Half-fiend" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to a living, corporeal creature with an Int score of 4 or more. A half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: HD 4 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to outsider (native). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +1.

Defenses/Qualities: Gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to poison; acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more); and SR equal to creature's CR + 11 (maximum 35).

Speed: Unless the base creature flies better, the half-fiend flies at twice the base creature's land speed (good).

Melee: A half-fiend gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. Damage depends on its size (see pages 301-302).

Special Attacks: A half-fiend gains the following.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day as a swift action the half-fiend can smite good as the smite evil ability of a paladin of the same level as the half-fiend's Hit Dice, except affecting a good target. The smite persists until the target is dead of the half-fiend rests.

Spell-Like Abilities: A half-fiend with an Int or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day. CL equals the creature's HD (or the CL of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).

<table class="inner"><tr><td>HD</td><td>Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>1-2</td><td>Darkness 3/day</td></tr> <tr><td>3-4</td><td>Desecrate </td></tr> <tr><td>5-6</td><td>Unholy blight</td></tr> <tr><td>7-8</td><td>Poison 3/day</td></tr> <tr><td>9-10</td><td>Contagion</td></tr> <tr><td>11-12</td><td>Blasphemy</td></tr> <tr><td>13-14</td><td>Unholy aura 3/day, unhallow</td></tr> <tr><td>15-16</td><td>Horrid wilting</td></tr> <tr><td>17-18</td><td>Summon monster IX (fiends only)</td></tr> <tr><td>19-20</td><td>Destruction</td></tr></table>
Abilities: A half-fiend gains a +4 bonus on three ability scores of its choice and a +2 bonus on the other three.

Skills: A half-fiend with racial HD has skill points per racial HD equal to 6 + Int mod. Racial class skills are unchanged, and class level skill ranks are unaffected.
