Extending Jaw (Ex) A giant dragonfly nymph can extend its jaws with surprising speed. Not only does this extend the nymph's reach with its bite attack, but during the surprise round, a nymph gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls with its bite.


Description

Giant dragonflies lay clutches of eggs in swampy terrain or areas of standing water. Their young, called nymphs, voraciously eat carrion and small prey, growing and maturing rapidly until they sprout fully functional wings and become adult dragonflies.

This glittering blue dragonfly is about the size of a horse and is large enough to carry off small farm animals or people.
