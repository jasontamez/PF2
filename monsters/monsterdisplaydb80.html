Special Abilities

Blood Frenzy (Ex) When a rabisu successfully drains blood from a creature, it becomes frenzied. For 1d4 rounds after it drains blood, it acts as if affected by haste and gains fast healing 5.

Susceptible to Salt (Ex) A handful of salt burns a rabisu as a flask of acid would, causing 1d6 points of damage per use. Ground sprinkled with salt functions as difficult terrain for a rabisu. A line of salt placed across a doorway, window, or other aperture can largely prevent a rabisu from passing through that opening. It can attempt to go through the opening as a move action, but unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Fortitude save, the salt prevents it from completing the movement, and it becomes nauseated for 1 round.

Description

Despite their ghoulish appearance, rabisus are living creatures, not undead. While they can manipulate objects with their talons, they cannot wield weapons. Rabisus take great delight in the taste of blood. To these fey, this flavor can vary greatly, even between two similar creatures. Rabisus might keep particularly delicious victims prisoner for months to prolong the pleasure of savoring their blood.

A rabisu stands 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.
