Description

Within the church of the goddess of undeath, few more coveted stations exist than daughter of Urgathoa, yet no high priest can bestow the title, and no living worshiper can take the role. Rather, daughters of Urgathoa are selected by the fickle goddess herself, chosen from her most zealous and accomplished priestesses only at the moment of their deaths. Even after their transformations into things of pestilence and dead flesh, daughters of Urgathoa remain social beings who typically surround themselves with fanatical cults.
