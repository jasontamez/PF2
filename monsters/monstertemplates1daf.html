As a conduit of divine power, a cleric creature is often viewed with great respect by its community. A cleric creature's CR increases by 2 if the creature has 7 or more HD, and it increases by 3 if the creature has 13 or more HD. A cleric creature must worship a deity (which must be determined when the template is added) and its alignment must be within one step of that deity's.
