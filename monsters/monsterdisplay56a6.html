Unchosen - Monsters







Gnoll, Unchosen

A hulking monstrosity lumbers forth, its canine jaws snapping ferociously. Its matted, speckled hide and hyena-like cackle hint at its animalistic nature, yet it walks like a man, even though its grotesque proportions seem wholly unnatural. A circular patch of thickened, gray scar tissue nestles in the filthy fur in the center of its forehead.

Special Abilities

Deathwatch (Ex) The tampering with the unchosen's brain has granted the creature the ability to "scent life." As long as targets are in range of the unchosen's scent ability, it instantly knows whether each creture in the area is dead, fragile (alive and wounded with 3 or fewer hit points left), fighting off death (alive with 4 or more hit points), undead, or neither alive nor dead (such as a construct).

Ferocity (Ex) An unchosen becomes enraged if mortally wounded. It continues to fight without penalty even while disabled or dying, and as long as it has less than 0 hit points, it gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and all weapon damage rolls.

Foresighted (Su) An unchosen's trepanation has partially unlocked an almost psychic ability to sense peril. It gains a +2 insight bonus on Initiative checks and to its armor class.

Description

Unchosen stand between 10 and 12 feet tall. Masses of bloated muscle and matted fur, they possess insatiable instincts for acts of violence upon other living creatures, including their own kind. They are highly territorial as well as voracious predators, which one might infer by their thick, arrowhead-shaped teeth.

Creation

The process of unchosen creation is based on the sacred and dangerous Lamashtan ritual known as the Growing of the Third Eye. A worshiper of Lamashtu uses this ritual to drill or cut a hole into a creature's brow, just between his eyes. The trepanation is said to grant a third eye, just like that possessed by the Mother of Monsters, and indeed when done properly with the appropriate rituals, gnolls who undergo the painful ritual seem to gain strange insights.

The first unchosen was created from a gnoll named Ghartok after he was infused by raw unholy power from a stegocentipede sacred to the faith of Rovagug. Impressed with his newfound power, Ghartok (now the Carrion King) captured a mad alchemist, whom he forced to discover a method of duplicating this transformation. By combining the Growing of the Third Eye and a number of vile alchemical concoctions, the alchemist managed to duplicate most of the unchosen transformation, but the process invariably results in the destruction of the gnoll's mind. They emerge as strong and powerful as intended, but are little more than difficult-to-control beasts, nearly as dangerous to their allies as they are to their enemies. Of course, the results of the transformation embody the teachings of the Rough Beast, for he is a god of wrath and destruction, and as long as prayers to Rovagug remain a part of the transformation process, it is unlikely that any alchemist will be able to create an unchosen that retains its reason and intelligence.

The actual process is grisly and painful, and takes 2d4 hours to properly perform. At the end of this procedure, the gnoll must make a DC 15 Fortitude save. Success indicates that the procedure merely causes 2d6 points of damage and 1d12 points of Intelligence drain-if this drain reduces the gnoll's Intelligence to 0, he is killed by the procedure. If the gnoll fails the saving throw, he undergoes a 24-hour transformation into one of the hulking unchosen- during this period of change, the gnoll lies in a fevered state and is effectively helpless, but when he wakens, his transformation is complete.
