Tactics

During Combat The bombardier hurls bombs at enemies, or uses directed blast if the foes are grouped closely together. He uses unstable accelerants with the bombs that seem most likely to hit. He saves most of his alchemical items to use with the alchemical weapon ability if he gets stuck fighting in melee range. In this circumstance, he drinks his mutagen before attacking.

Special Abilities

Alternate Racial Features (Ex) The bombardier has the engineer racial trait in place of sneaky, granting him a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Knowledge (engineering) checks. He also employs the hobgoblin alternate favored class option for his alchemy levels, granting him four additional uses of his bomb ability each day. Both of these racial options can be found on page 121 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Race Guide.

Description

These alchemists focus their race's penchant for fire into more productive and efficient means of destruction than mere torches or bonfires. Instead, they hone the craft of concocting bombs, mutagens, and extracts. Though they possess the means of enhancing their physical prowess, many bombardiers forgo imbibing their mutagens prior to battle, believing that increasing one's weaknesses, even for potential gain in other areas, is a tactical mistake. When the situation calls for it, however, they drink mutagens to increase their physical stamina or ranged accuracy, preferring to decrease their perception and influence before compromising their mental faculties.
