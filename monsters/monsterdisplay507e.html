Dinosaur, Therizinosaurus

This feathered bipedal saurian looks somewhat comical-save for its outlandish sword-sized claws.

Special Abilities

Sprint (Ex) Once per hour, a therizinosaurus can move at 10 times its normal speed (400 feet) when it makes a charge.

Sweeping Strike (Ex) As a full-round action, a therizinosaurus can hunker down and make a great, sweeping attack with its claws against up to four adjacent foes. The dinosaur makes an attack roll against each target, inflicting claw damage on a successful hit.

Vicious Claws (Ex) A therizinosaurus's claws threaten a critical hit on an 18-20.

Description

At first glance, this dinosaur's massive claws may well convince observers that it is a predator, but the therizinosaurus is in fact an omnivore. Nonetheless, the therizinosaurus has a foul temper and is both easily angered and difficult to spook. With its deep-cutting claws, the therizinosaurus is more than a match for even the mightiest of predatory dinosaurs. A therizinosaurus is 35 feet long and weighs 13,000 pounds.
