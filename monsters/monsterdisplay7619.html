Special Abilities

Freeze (Ex) A hollow helm can hold itself so still it appears to be a normal suit of armor. A hollow helm that uses freeze can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight, disguised as normal armor.

Skull Cage (Ex) A hollow helm sometimes pretends to be normal armor, letting a creature try to wear it before revealing its deadly nature. If the hollow helm makes a successful combat maneuver to grapple an opponent of Medium size or smaller, the grappled creature is also blinded. Creatures that purposefully try to wear a hollow helm are automatically grappled. This blindness lasts until the hollow helm's grapple is broken. A hollow helm cannot attack a creature it is grappling. If a hollow helm is damaged while it is grappling, the creature it is grappling takes an equal amount of damage.

Description

Raised from the corpses of knights and soldiers slain by treachery rather than battle or conf licts considered crimes even in the heat of war, phantom armors appear as suits of animate armor, walking or f loating of their own accord. Most phantom armors haunt the halls and blasted battlef ields where they were slain, seeking revenge against their murderers or, should that prove impossible, confronting any living creature that might give them the opportunity to do battle once more. Dastardly necromancers have also discovered the process for binding violent spirits to suits of armor, giving rise to eerie servants that combine endless patience with cold brutality.

Phantom armors come in many shapes and sizes; some appear to be nothing more than animate helms while others resemble armored giants.

Creating Phantom Armor

Phantom armors of varying types can be created using the spell create undead, as detailed below. In addition to requiring a corpse for it to be cast upon, the spell requires that body must be wearing a suit of heavy armor. The corpse dissolves into the armor at the conclusion of the spell's casting.
