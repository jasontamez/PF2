Special Abilities

Corporeal Form (Ex) As an immediate action, the herald can take physical form, losing its incorporeal special quality and subtype and its deflection bonus to AC, but gaining a Strength score of 20 and a natural armor bonus equal to its incorporeal deflection bonus.

Eldritch Blast (Su) The herald chooses an additional effect for its eldritch blasts each round (DC 26 negates). A creature that fails its saves against both blasts in the same round suffers an increased effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Dement (Will): The creature is confused for 1 minute. Increased effect: The creature goes insane (as insanity).
Displace (Fortitude): The creature teleports (as dimension door) 5 feet in a random horizontal direction at the end of its turn each round for the next 10 rounds. Increased effect: The creature is affected by maze.
Ignite (Reflex): The creature takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Increased effect: The creature catches on fire.

Energy Channel Aura (Su) On its turn, the herald can channel energy (Will DC 26 half) to deal 2d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage to each creature in its aura. A creature struck by its incorporeal touch attack also takes this damage (no saving throw). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

In its natural, incorporeal form, Nethys's herald is a storm of magic, immediately recognizable as a creature of the arcane and divine. It rises just over 7 feet tall, and has a habit of floating a few inches above the ground instead of walking.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
