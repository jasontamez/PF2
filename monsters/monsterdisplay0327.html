Special Abilities

Aqueous (Ex) Because of nualidus' partially elemental nature, whenever a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against a nualidu, there is a 25% chance that the extra damage is negated and damage is rolled normally.

Cascade (Su) As a full-round action, a nualidu can expel a cascade of water from their body to batter an opponent within 80 feet as a ranged touch attack that deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Creatures struck by this disorienting attack must also succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or be unable to make attacks of opportunity for one round. Whether or not the target succeeds at this saving throw, the nualidu can ride this cascade of water forward, immediately appearing in the nearest unoccupied square adjacent to the target, as if using dimension door.

Drench (Ex) The nualidu's touch puts out Large or smaller nonmagical flames. The outsider can dispel magical fire they touch as per dispel magic (caster level is equal to the nualidu's Hit Dice).

Description

Though among the most capricious and mercurial of azatas, nualidus are strongly protective of natural waterways across the multiverse. They despise polluters and those who use water to cause pain and suffering, such as the captains of slave ships. This attitude remains constant, despite nualidus' tendency to make and break relationships with others in moments.

These azatas are constantly on the move, rarely staying in one place for very long. Their persistent need to travel makes it difficult for nualidus to complete any but the simplest of tasks in an amount of time most mortals would find acceptable, but nualidus have long memories. An individual nualidu might return to a location hundreds of years later to finish a job they started, even if everyone else involved long ago forgot or died of old age. Nualidus also act similarly in combat, flowing between opponents and across the terrain, only to flee if they become bored. They rely heavily on their natural powers and spell-like abilities to shove foes around the battlefield.

Nualidus are made recognizable by the elemental water making up much of their lithe, sylvan forms, which draw down into long, serpentine tails. This water constantly churns; no matter what kind of surface a nualidu travels across, their waters remain clean and fresh. A nualidu's hair color ranges from the sparkling blue of tropical waters to seafoam green, and matches that of their twinkling eyes. A typical nualidu stands a little over 5 feet tall and is quite slender, weighing only 130 pounds.

Ecology

Nualidus form from the souls of virtuous members of aquatic races, or else from the souls of moral people who spent the majority of their lives near or on water, such as kind dockworkers, sailors, and lighthouse keepers. Little remains of their mortal traits or memories upon their creation, aside from hazy memories of sunsets upon the waves and familiar ports of call, which nualidus might spend the entirety of their immortal existences trying to locate. Their bodies are clear and cool upon creation, but darken considerably with age, until their roiling forms resemble the blackest oceanic trenches.

Nualidus generally spring from the waters of Elysium, in the strongest concentrations of chaotic influence, and it is no coincidence they are extremely capricious and impermanent. From their personalities to their long tails, the aquatic outsiders resemble proteans as much as they do their fellow celestials, and whispers up and down the planes claim that they are the children of some ancient god's dalliance with a protean lord. Proteans are widely varied in their relations to the curious azatas, with many considering nualidus distant kin while others see them as a mockery of proteans' ideally chaotic forms.

Habitat and Society

When not on Elysium, nualidus travel natural waterways and oceans, experiencing the extremes of the natural world. They tolerate manufactured canals to a much lesser extent, as such courses are often polluted by the mortals who created them. If the source of the contamination seems readily apparent, a nualidu usually attempts to rectify the problem regardless of locals' needs or wishes. In most cases, though, the issue is endemic of civilization, and no nualidu can stand to remain in one place long enough to change an entire society.

A nualidu has no permanent place of residence and generally eschews shelter, preferring to rest under the stars on beaches or in underwater caves. Despite their mercurial and transient nature, these celestials are very community-oriented, forming small pods of like-minded individuals who travel together to pursue a common interest or goal. Nualidu pods fluctuate constantly as members find other interests or new members join, but when together, pods are as protective as any human family. To threaten or insult one nualidu in a group is to threaten or insult the entire pod.

More so than other azatas, nualidus relish courtly titles, and often invent grandiose new ones, accumulating a long list of honorifics as time passes. Most eventually grow bored with titles they're accrued and shed them without a second thought, only to collect new ones during their next journeys. The more bombastic and flamboyant a title, the longer it holds a nualidu's interest and remains part of their name. While their epithets tend to reference their exploits and triumphs, nualidus are no strangers to exaggeration. Some particularly pretentious titles include "the Marquis of a Thousand Waves," "the Exalted Maharajah of the Unstoppable Current," "the Jubilant Savior of the Laughing Stream," and "the Grand Caliph of Inundations, Bane of Droughts." A nualidu's titles might be both masculine and feminine, as their attitudes toward gender are as fluid as their personalities.

Nualidus despise anything they see as a perversion of their treasured water, especially human drinks such as coffee, tea, and alcohol. They look down on all who drink such abominations, considering them classless at best, and directly insulting at worst. Depending on the nualidu's mood, the outsider might either politely refuse such an offered libation or launch into a screed demonizing the substance and all the harm it has caused mortalkind. A particularly incensed nualidu may even go so far as to seek out the nearest brewery or winery and destroy it. This attitude rarely extends to naturally derived fluids, such as fruit juices and plant nectar.

Calling a Nualidu

A nualidu can be called with lesser planar ally, although it is very difficult to call the same nualidu more than once. The azatas prefer tasks that contribute in some way to the protection or cleaning of a body of water, and generally accept payment with gems or valuable stones that have been eroded by flowing water into unique and organic shapes. They also demand at least a token amount of respect from their callers, and most nualidus require their callers to treat them politely and to memorize, if not directly use, at least a handful of their myriad titles.

Azatas are a race of celestials native to the plane of Elysium, where the pursuit of freedom and goodness is paramount. Azatas are champions of these concepts, great bards, knights, and explorers who roam the planes in search of good folk in need of their help. Frequently described as the most elven or fey-like celestials, azatas nevertheless often have strange, inhuman shapes or can take elemental or eldritch forms. Most have some knightly or courtly title, such as duke, countess, or prince, apparently hereditary, perhaps from a celestial monarchy long abandoned and forgotten. Azatas do not exploit these titles to exert influence over each other, instead using them for personal identification or a bit of self-importance. They are deadly and resolute foes of evil, fearless and clever in battle.

It is not surprising that the three best-known kinds of azatas can all fly, for they rarely stay in one place for long and prefer the thrill of motion and discovery to creature comforts. Most azata "settlements" are little more than a collection of tents around a landmark, gathered over the course of a day to share news, stories, and perhaps good-natured duels, and then packed up again a few days later. Such temporary settlements are colorful and have a celebratory atmosphere, as azatas are quick to greet any of their kind as old friends. Although few can predict when and where an azata community might arise, some groups or breeds of azatas gather in cycles for traditional festivals and reunions. Such gatherings typically take place at a time of mystical consequence, such as on the evening of the lunar equinox, or during less predictable times, such as upon the wedding of two seers, and always in a place of pristine or stunning natural wonder. All azatas fundamentally know when and where the closest or next gathering of their people might occur, and while none are required or even expected to attend, all are welcome. These gatherings do not preclude more permanent azata holdings and communes, however, and the heights of Elysium endlessly ring with the songs of azata choirs.

While the stoic, homebound archons call their cousins flighty, azatas are driven by a crusading nature and feel bored when forced to stay in one place too long. This tendency also means they are unlikely to agree to serve mortals for an extended period of time, preferring to arrive, get the job done, and move on to some other quest or challenge. As much as they seek to spread the cause of freedom and joy, azatas realize that they cannot enforce such virtues throughout the multiverse. Without darkness there can be no light, and without struggle there can be no victory. Understanding this, these celestials remain removed from the majority of mortal conflicts, preferring to act as advisors in such situations rather than champions, granting goodly mortals ownership over their own triumphs. In cases where the forces of evil act overtly, however, and intrude upon mortal worlds, azatas are quick to rally to defend such realms and aid those who have no hope of defending themselves.

Azatas generally work together, but their powerful personalities and strong sense of individual freedom often see them disagreeing on how best to handle a particular situation. While both parties have the greater good at heart, these arguments can fester and grow into long-lasting grudges. In cases where a single azata is convinced his way is right, he might even enter a sort of self-imposed exile, abandoning the support of his kin so he can launch a one-azata crusade against the cruelties of the multiverse.

Most azatas originate from the untamable beauty of Elysium, created and nourished by the influx of goodly mortal souls. Like most other outsiders, they cannot reproduce with each other in the mortal fashion, and often tryst with mortals who prove charming and good spirited. Azatas dally frequently with their own kind, being quick to seek out feelings of love, joy, and companionship, but rarely feel bound or exclusive to merely one lover, regardless of its race.

Azatas speak Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal, but can speak with almost any creature because of their truespeech special ability. See creature subtypes for full details on truespeech and other shared azata traits.
