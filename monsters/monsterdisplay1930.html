The flesh of this withered woman's face stretches tightly over her skull, with one red eye bulging fat in its socket.

Special Abilities

Dreadful Ravings (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, the moon hag can howl a litany of dreadful prognostications at a creature within 30 feet. The predictions afflict the victim, gnawing away at its sanity. This is a language-dependent curse effect; if a moon (including Groetus) is visible to the victim, it takes a -2 penalty on the save against the effect.

Dreadful Ravings-curse; save Will DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Wisdom damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Lunatic Insight (Su) A moon hag adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to AC and on initiative checks. These bonuses increase by 2 when a moon (including Groetus) is visible above (this increase is not included in the statistics above).

Description

Moon hags are foul prophets that haunt the Boneyard's endless tombs, serving Groetus, the skull-faced moon hanging eternally above. These lurid hags almost universally worship Groetus, and many claim to be mouthpieces for this god of oblivion.

Moon hags are extremely knowledgeable about the secret paths and portals of the Boneyard, and they often use this knowledge to journey to the Material Plane for sinister purposes. Most moon hags use this opportunity to birth and abandon changelings, seeing even their wayward daughters as agents of Groetus's will.

Moon hag changelings are especially pale-skinned, and many are plagued by chronic anxiety, leading them to become reclusive. The daughter of a moon hag gains the moon daughter racial trait: she gains a +1 insight bonus to her AC but takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. If a moon is visible, the bonus and penalty each increase by 1.

Customizing Hag Covens

Any group of three hags can form a coven, but realistically, many types of hags will never cross paths or deign to work with one another. Blood hags are loath to form covens that are not under their control. Annis hags are likewise domineering, rarely working with more powerful hags. Storm hags usually prefer allying with other storm hags, but they will occasionally form covens with green hags or sea hags. Sea hags sometimes seek out a green hag to lead them. Mute hags-among the most powerful of mortal hags-relish the destruction of relationships, and their involvement in a coven is typically transient, lasting only as long as whatever barrier prompted them to seek sisters in the first place. Night hags and dreamthief hags are outsiders that wander the planes in search of victims. These cautious schemers do not hesitate to involve mortal hags in their machinations, readily joining covens when it proves expedient. Their immortality grants them great patience and enough time to plan contingencies so that betraying them becomes a risky proposition.

A typical hag coven can cast the spells listed in the green hag's monster entry (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 167). Blood hags, storm hags, and winter hags always grant the spells and abilities listed in their bestiary entries. To reflect the diversity of powers hags can invoke, Game Masters can customize the spell lists of covens based on their membership; each type of hag makes specific spells available to cast as coven magic.

All covens can cast the following spells, regardless of the hags that comprise them: <a href="spelldisplayc394.html?ItemName=Animate%20Dead">animate dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayedf1.html?ItemName=Baleful%20Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4414.html?ItemName=Bestow%20Curse">bestow curse</a>, <a href="spelldisplay3517.html?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya33d.html?ItemName=Commune">commune</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf711.html?ItemName=Dream">dream</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya816.html?ItemName=Forcecage">forcecage</a>, <a href="spelldisplay218d.html?ItemName=Mind%20Blank">mind blank</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7555.html?ItemName=Reincarnate">reincarnate</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya200.html?ItemName=Speak%20with%20Dead">speak with dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplay1ac4.html?ItemName=Veil">veil</a>, <a href="spelldisplay42e8.html?ItemName=Vision">vision</a>

If dryads, nymphs, and sprites represent the grace and beauty of unspoiled nature, then surely the annis hag, green hag, and sea hag embody its savage, destructive side. Though not fey themselves, hags appear to be somehow tied to nature, even if no more than as a distorted reflection of it. Hags are foul, wicked creatures, warped with cruelty and evil. Uniformly female and invariably repulsive, these misshapen crones plot dark deeds over bubbling cauldrons, either singly or in sinister triads known as covens.
