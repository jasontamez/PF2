Angustiden - Monsters







Shark, Angustiden

This majestic beast glides through the water with murderous intent. Its thick-toothed maw is wide enough for a human to stand in, and its body stretches back more than 20 feet.

Special Abilities

Powerful Jaws (Ex) The teeth of the angustiden are so sharp and tough that they make light work of almost any material. When the angustiden makes a successful grapple attempt following the use of its grab ability, it automatically makes a sunder attempt against the armor worn by the creature grappled as a free action. Each round the grapple is maintained it makes another sunder attempt against its victim's armor.

Description

The angustiden is a gargantuan hunter of the deep sea. The size and ferocity of this behemoth are matched only by those of the megalodon, and it counts even the great white shark among its prey. Its foot-long, dense, and jagged teeth tear through anything they choose to clamp down on, and very few creatures manage to leave such an embrace with all of their body parts.
