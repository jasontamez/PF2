Tactics

During Combat The hunter prefers to charge into melee to make use of his rhino hide charge bonus. If he has an advantage in the battle, he uses nonlethal attacks to capture prey alive, because live captives are more fun for him and his family. He sets his wolf companion on any spellcasters who are bothering him. If he thinks he might be slain, he mercilessly carves through his foes, focusing on killing any humans first.

A common practice among depraved ogre hunters who catch humanoid prey is to sever the victim's hand, foot, or entire limb, cauterize the wound, and then force the creature to watch while the ogre or his hungry wolf companion devours the amputated body part; when the captive has no limbs left, it's kicked around like a toy and finally roasted on a spit.

This lumbering giant's beady eyes are devoid of wit or kindness, and its puffy face features a wide mouth with ill-fitting teeth.
