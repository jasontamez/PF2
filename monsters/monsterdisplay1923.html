Munavri

Jade armor covers this lean albino humanoid, and her pale eyes have an eerie gleam.

Special Abilities

Advanced Object Reading (Su) A munavri can instantly learn how to use almost any device. Once per day, she can select one weapon, suit of armor, or spell trigger item on which she has cast object reading. For a number of minutes equal to her character level, she is considered proficient with that item or can make use of the spell trigger device as if she were a spellcaster of the appropriate class.

Description

These pale humanoids, who hail from the distant shores of strange subterranean oceans, have long warred against the encroaching urdefhans (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 276). Munavris pilot violet-sailed, intricately carved ivory ships across the inky black depths of underground oceans and are adept at lightless naval battles. They sometimes find allies among the dark folk, but such pacts are far from universal and are marked by distrust.
