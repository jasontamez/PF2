When explorers find tombs housing the mummified remains of important and powerful beings, they often find those mummies accompanied by animals-ones that the interred found significant or that represented their ideals in life. Some of these mummified animals were created and placed in the tombs as guardians. Below are common examples of mummified animals, as well as the mummified animal template.
