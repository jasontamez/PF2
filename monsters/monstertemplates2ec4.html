Creatures with the fungoid simple template appear as they did in life, save that their flesh is pallid and moist and mushrooms and mold cake their bodies. This template can be applied to any living, non-plant creature. A fungoid creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: The creature's type changes to plant, and it gains all of the traits of the <a href="monstertypes918f.html?ItemName=Plant">plant</a> type. The creature gains telepathy with a range of 100 feet with other fungoid creatures. Its alignment changes to chaotic evil.

Fungal Creature Template: Optionally, you can use the <a href="monstertemplates47c8.html?ItemName=Fungal%20Creature">fungal creature template</a> to represent creatures transformed by a fungus queen. In this case, the fungal creature's alignment changes to chaotic evil.
