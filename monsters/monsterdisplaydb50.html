Nightmare

This eerie horse-like creature's skin is an inky blackness. Fire spurts from its hair and nostrils, and its hooves spray sparks.

Special Abilities

Smoke (Su) In battle, a nightmare exhales smoke that chokes and blinds foes, filling a 15-foot cone each round as a free action. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened until 1d6 minutes after leaving the area. This smoke acts as obscuring mist for the purposes of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Nightmares are flaming harbingers of death. They allow only the most evil of creatures to ride them, and are never mere mounts, but rather willing partners in destruction.

The cauchemar is a more dangerous variant of the nightmare, particularly valued for its ability to enter the Ethereal Plane with its rider in addition to being able to use plane shift to invade other realities.
