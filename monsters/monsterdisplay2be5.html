Kuru

Disturbing tribal tattoos cover this red-eyed humanoid's face, and his jagged teeth appear to have been filed down to points.

Special Abilities

Blood Courage (Ex) Once per day when a kuru makes a saving throw against a fear effect, he can roll the saving throw twice and take the better result. He must decide to use this ability before the saving throw is attempted.

Cannibalistic Vitality (Ex) When a kuru hits a living creature with its bite attack, he gains 1 temporary hit point by ingesting the target's blood. This ability does not work on creatures that do not have blood.

Description

Kuru are savage natives of the Shackles, dreadfully transformed by their loathsome "goddess," the Blood Queen. While most kuru live in small tribal villages in or around Ghol-Gan ruins, some choose to abandon their cultic faith and seek adventure beyond the islands from which they hail, though such individuals are extremely rare.
