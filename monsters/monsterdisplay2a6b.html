Description

Moas are large, flightless birds that, with their necks
outstretched, stand nearly as tall as ogres. They roam
the grasslands feeding
on the thick grasses
and shrubs that are
mostly inedible to
smaller birds and
mammals. While
these birds are
gigantic, they are
rather docile and
skittish, preferring
to flee than fight.
They can become
aggressive when faced
with predators or perceived
threats to their young or food
sources. In these cases, the larger birds of
a colony or group move forward to protect
the young and weak moas of the flock.
These larger moas leap into
the air and lash out with both
of their broad, sharp talons to
inf lict grievous wounds.

A full-grown moa can weigh
as much as 500 lbs.
