Special Abilities

Air Mastery (Ex) Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against the herald.

Drench (Ex) The herald's touch puts out Huge or smaller nonmagical flames. The herald can dispel magical fire it touches as dispel magic (caster level 19th).

Energy Ray (Ex) The herald can shoot rays of cold or electricity up to 100 feet. These can threaten a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19, or 20.

Vortex (Su) The herald can create a whirlpool at will as a standard action. This ability functions identically to its whirlwind special attack, but can only form underwater and cannot leave the water.

Water Mastery (Ex) The herald gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (Unlike a water elemental, the herald does not have a penalty if it or its opponent is touching the ground.)

Description

Gozreh's herald, Personification of Fury, is a living elemental storm of air and water. It may once have been an actual storm given independent life and intelligence, but it does not remember anything before awakening in the service of Gozreh. Its powers allow it to shift itself fully into air or water or even to assume the form of a beast, though it is most comfortable in its dual-material elemental shape. As a living storm, the herald can provide life-sustaining water, whisk others to safety, save mortals from drowning, or rain down watery death upon the enemies of Gozreh. It is comfortable doing any of these things, and has no objection to taking lives' even innocent lives, if this serves the will of Gozreh. With Gozreh's permission, it sometimes acts as an intermediary between rival elemental forces.

The Herald of Gozreh rises to nearly 25 feet in height, and its changeable form usually weighs approximately 1 ton.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
