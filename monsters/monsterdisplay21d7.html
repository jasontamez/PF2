Lilitu - Monsters







Demon, Lilitu

While this seductive woman has goat horns, goat hooves, and a serpentine tail, her eyeless face is her most disturbing feature.

Special Abilities

Branding (Su) Each time a lilitu damages a living creature with her tail slap, the wound leaves an angry and permanent red brand. The creature struck becomes staggered for 1 round from the pain. A successful DC 26 Will save negates the staggered condition and reduces the duration of the brand from permanent to 1 hour. The save DC is Charisma-based. Removing brands is difficult-each casting of restoration, dispel chaos, or dispel evil removes one brand. Heal removes 1d4+4 brands. Greater restoration removes a number of brands equal to the spell's caster level. Miracle and wish can each remove all brands at once. The number of brands a creature gains in this manner has a cumulative series of effects, as listed below.

1-3 Brands: The lilitu can affect the branded creature with its create husk, husk link, and profane pact abilities.

4-6 Brands: The branded creature takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. The branded creature's aura now radiates chaos and evil.

7-9 Brands: The branded creature's Wisdom score is reduced by 4. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect.

10 or More Brands: The penalties to the creature's Will saves and Wisdom score that are listed above double. In addition, the branded creature automatically fails all Will saves made against a lilitu's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A chaotic evil creature is immune to this effect.

Create Husk (Su) Once per day as a swift action, when a lilitu deals enough damage with a weapon, spell, or spell-like ability to kill a branded Small or Medium humanoid within 30 feet, she can instead opt to transform that slain humanoid into a husk. The targeted creature can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to negate this effect, allowing it to die normally. A humanoid transformed into a husk withers away into an immobile and desiccated corpse, but does not actually die-in this state, the creature remains aware of its surroundings but can take no actions at all. A husk is essentially treated as an object with hardness 15 and 60 hit points; it weighs 10% of the original creature's weight. If a husk is destroyed, the effect ends and the body dies. This is a curse effect- removing this curse restores the victim to life at a number of negative hit points equal to the creature's Constitution - 1; a husk restored to life in this way has 1 round to stabilize or be healed before it dies. A lilitu can maintain a number of husks simultaneously equal to her Charisma bonus (8 husks for the typical lilitu); if she creates more husks than she can maintain, a previously created husk (chosen by the lilitu) is released and immediately dies. Lilitus hide their husk collections in very safe places. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Husk Link (Su) By spending a minute in blasphemous contact with a husk she created, a lilitu can establish a supernatural link to that husk. As long as she and that husk remain on the same plane, divination spells reveal the linked husk's alignment to be the same as the lilitu's alignment (chaotic evil). The link allows a lilitu to use her change shape ability to assume a husk's original form, gaining a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate that person. If a lilitu with an active husk link takes enough damage to be slain, the husk takes the killing blow's damage instead and is destroyed, instantly severing the active husk link; if the lilitu is disguised in the husk's original form, she instantly reverts to her true form.

Profane Grace (Su) A lilitu gains a +4 profane bonus to AC and on Initiative checks and Reflex saves.

Profane Pact (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a lilitu can forge a profane pact with a willing humanoid creature bearing at least one lilitu brand by touching the creature for 1 full round. A single creature can have no more than one profane pact with a lilitu at any time. This functions identically to a succubus's profane gift ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 68), save that it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the humanoid's choice and it does not grant a telepathic link to the target.

Profane Wishcraft (Su) A creature that accepts a wish from a lilitu immediately becomes chaotic evil unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Will save. A creature that becomes chaotic evil in this way gains the benefits of a good hope spell for 24 hours, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 days (these spell effects function at CL 17th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Swift Claws (Ex) When a lilitu makes a full attack, she can attack twice with each of her claws, for a total of four attacks in that round.

Description

Lilitus are subversive and hidden horrors, demons who work subtly in their constant quest to destroy and devastate. Whereas most demons prefer to rend and destroy, the lilitu is more akin to the succubus-she prefers to do her work in humanoid form to infect society with sin from within. Lilitus enjoy few things more than leading mortals into all manner of sinful acts, in the hope that when the mortal perishes, its soul will fuel the Abyss. Despite some superficial similarities to succubi, lilitus are not solely concerned with the sin of lust. The exact nature of sin that a lilitu tempts a mortal into committing varies, for these demons are adept at reading mortal desires and secrets, quickly discerning which sins a specific target can be convinced to perform.

Lilitus have numerous tools at their disposal for the encouragement of sin, but they much prefer their humanoid victims to commit sins of their own free will. As such, lilitus generally use their abilities to deceive and beguile mortals rather than forcing them to execute heinous acts. A son convinced to kill for his mother (the disguised lilitu) to rectify a grave injustice elicits far more delight than compelling a mind-controlled humanoid to do such a deed.

In her true form, a lilitu appears as an eyeless, horned, snake-tailed-but otherwise beautiful-human woman. Despite her lack of eyes, a lilitu can see with ease. A lilitu forms from the soul of a mortal who lured others of its kind to commit sins.

Lilitus are more likely than other demons to devote their work to a specific demon lord, yet they do not generally view such devotion as true servitude. It's simply convenient to have a specific demigod in mind when seeking to corrupt a mortal's faith and to convince such fallen souls to shift their own allegiance from a prior deity to the lilitu's chosen demon lord. When a lilitu chooses to ally herself with a demon lord, she takes on certain physical characteristics that reflect that demon lord's personality or appearance. For example, a lilitu that serves Dagon, the demon lord of deformity, sea monsters, and the sea might bear scaly skin like that of a fish, webbed fingers and toes, and finlike ridges on her head instead of the more typical goat's horns. A lilitu that serves Pazuzu, on the other hand, might have vestigial feathery wings on her back and bird's talons instead of hooves for feet. These appearance changes are cosmetic only and never impact the lilitu's options for natural attacks. Of course, the demon's ability to change shape or assume the form of a captured husk allows the demon to disguise her true form at will. Lilitus who serve specific demon lords in this manner often have class levels. A lilitu typically focuses on class roles such as bards, rogues, swashbucklers, or any other agility- and deception-based classes.

Lilitus typically stand 6 to 6-1/2 feet tall and weigh 130 to 150 pounds.

Demons exist for one reason-to destroy. Where their more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape them into reflections of their own evil, demons seek only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy-for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon's depredations and flee to his just reward in the afterlife. It is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels a demon's lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.

Demons are the most prolific and among the most destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across the multiverse as the Abyss. Before the first fledgling deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully formed, the Abyss was infested with life.

Known to many scholars as "proto-demons," these wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, because of the influence of sinful mortal souls upon the Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the daemonic keepers of Abaddon and the cruel whims of fate and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the demonic hordes grows-a single soul can fuel the manifestation of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes and roles of the newly formed fiends.

The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the Maelstrom itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. Some flop on land while others flap in air or sea. Some are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work to the same goal-pain and suffering for mortal life in all its forms.

Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most demons find ways to twist their summoners' demands so that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks free of his control.

The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic sires to gift them with horrific children are common enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in support of that which would bring destruction to all.
