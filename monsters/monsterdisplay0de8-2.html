Description

A koto-furunishi is a tsukumogami that forms from
a koto, also known as a long zither. Benevolent but shy,
koto-furunishi enjoy playing beautiful music for others,
especially attentive and caring owners, but never when
they are being observed. Their penchant for doing so often
leads to confusion as to the identity of the mysterious
musician. If mistreated, a koto-furunishi never retaliates
against its owner, but instead leaves its home to join a
band of other tsukumogami who will appreciate its music
more than its former owner.

When an object reaches the 100-year anniversary of its crafting, sometimes it forms an amalgam with a <a href="monsterfamilies9402.html?ItemName=Kami">kami</a>, creating a creature known as a tsukumogami. Tsukumogami run the gamut in personality, outlook, and function. Objects that are well kept and cared for often form curious and helpful tsukumogami. Most commonly, tsukumogami are mischievous and frightening but not actually malign. Tsukumogami formed from objects that have been abandoned, neglected, or misused are dangerous both to the humans around and to themselves, as their uncontrolled rage might eventually transform them into <a href="monsterfamilies4db8.html?ItemName=Oni">oni</a>.


Creating a Tsukumogami

Tsukumogami is an acquired template that can be added to any <%MONSTER%Animated Object">animated object</a> (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A tsukumogami retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR + 2.

Alignment: Any.

Type: The creature's type changes to outsider (kami, native). Tsukumogami have good Reflex and Will saves, so increase the base creature's Reflex and Will saves to 2 + 1/2 its Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier.

Armor Class: A tsukumogami's natural armor bonus increases by 2.

Hit Dice: Retain the base creature's construct bonus hit points from size (if any). As outsiders, tsukumogami gain bonus hit points from high Constitution scores.

Spell-Like Abilities: Tsukumogami gain spell-like abilities based on their size, usable at will. The caster level is equal to the tsukumogami's Hit Dice.

Special Qualities and Defensive Abilities: Because it grows additional features such as a tongue, arms, or legs, a tsukumogami gains the additional attack animated object quality without spending Construction Points, and all its attacks increase their damage dice by one step. A tsukumogami can gain 10 bonus hit points as an additional option costing 1 CP. It gains the freeze special quality. As kami, tsukumogami gain immunity to petrification and polymorph effects; resist acid 10, electricity 10, and fire 10; telepathy 100 feet; fast healing 5; merge with ward; and ward. Though a tsukumogami loses its construct type, it keeps its hardness, low-light vision, and all its construct immunities. It can still be affected by spells that affect objects or constructs. A tsukumogami is always merged with its ward, and unlike most kami, it forms an amalgam with its ward, so it can move and communicate while merged.

Ability Scores: A tsukumogami has a 15 Intelligence, 17 Wisdom, and 14 Charisma. A Medium tsukumogami receives a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Dexterity, and a Constitution score of 19. These ability scores are adjusted for size.

Skills: A tsukumogami has a number of skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier. Its racial class skills are the base outsider class skills plus Disguise, Knowledge (history), Perform (any one), and Sleight of Hand.
