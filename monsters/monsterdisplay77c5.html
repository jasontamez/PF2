mouthed intestines below his five spidery legs.

Special Abilities

Boiling Spray (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Chavazvug can expel blasts of boiling bile, blood, and other bodily fluids from his dozens of seeping, dangling intestinal extrusions. This spray of boiling fluid strikes all creatures in a 60-foot burst centered on Chavazvug. A creature struck takes 10d10 points of fire damage and 10d10 points of acid damage from this spray of toxic fluids (Reflex DC 34 half). Any creature that takes any damage at all from this boiling spray (regardless of whether it succeeded at the Reflex save) must also succeed at DC 34 Fortitude save or become nauseated by the foul fluids for one round. This nausea effect is a poison effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Horrific Appearance (Su) A creature that succumbs to Chavazvug's horrific appearance feels its temperature rise swiftly, as if suddenly beset by a powerful fever. A creature that succeeds at a DC 28 Will save suffers no other effect from the qlippoth lord's horrific appearance, but one that fails gains a fiery red or orange tinge to its flesh. An affected creature takes a permanent -4 penalty on saving throws against fire effects and gains vulnerability to fire. All forms of fire resistance the creature benefits from function at half capacity (fire resistance 30 effectively functions as fire resistance 15, for example). All forms of immunity to fire that the creature has or later gains are suppressed, but in this case, the creature does not take any other penalty from this horrific appearance. If a creature has the fire subtype, it loses that subtype as long as it is affected by this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.

Rejuvenation (Ex) If Chavazvug is slain, his mind is catapulted back to one of the many boiling lakes of bile located in his Abyssal sanctum, where a new body grows around the qlippoth lord over the course of 1d10 days. During this period, Chavazvug is technically alive, but immobile and unable to take any actions other than float in the lake. If this new body is slain before the 1d10 days required to completely regrow have passed, Chavazvug is slain forever (although it should be noted that these boiling lakes of bile are rife with dangerous qlippoth and other monstrosities that are quite capable of defending and protecting Chavazvug's body). This rejuvenation ability replaces the rejuvenation ability that most qlippoth lords have (see page 231); Chavazvug is easier to track down and permanently slay, but his rejuvenation ability functions anywhere in the multiverse.

Searing Flesh (Ex) Any creature that strikes Chavazvug with a melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage from sprays of boiling matter and the mere proximity of the qlippoth lord's superheated body. A creature that strikes Chavazvug with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature that is grappling or grappled by Chavazvug takes 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of the creature's turn.

Slaughter Demon (Ex) Chavazvug gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against demons, and deals x3 damage on a confirmed critical hit against a demon (including tieflings of demonic descent). Whenever Chavazvug slays a demon, he gains the effects of death knell for 1 hour.

Tainted Resurrection (Sp) When Chavazvug resurrects a creature with his resurrection spell-like ability, the creature restored to life becomes corrupted and its alignment shifts one step closer to chaotic evil. The creature takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of all qlippoth (this penalty is permanent, but can be removed if the creature dies and is resurrected in some way other than via Chavazvug). A creature resurrected by Chavazvug gains the possessed creature corruption template (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures 250).

Description

Chavazvug appears as a towering mound of greasy, slithering intestines and internal organs held aloft by five long, slender legs that taper to razor-sharp points. Twitching coils and ropes of entrails dangle below the shuddering bulk, and the entire thing steams and glows with heat. Known as the Crawling Inferno, the very touch of this immense qlippoth lord can set flesh alight and his presence can cause living creatures normally immune to fire to burn alive. Chavazvug stands 50 feet high and weighs 20,000 pounds.

Unlike other qlippoth lords, Chavazvug has chosen to focus on battling demons themselves rather than the sinful souls that spawn them. This makes Chavazvug the least antagonistic of the known qlippoth lords to mortal worshipers, yet the qlippoth lord remains uncaring in the long term for the health and prosperity of "lesser beings" that worship him.

Chavazvug's Abyssal sanctum is a vast, crater strewn wasteland in an immense underground cavern deep in the Abyss. Many of these craters are filled with bile and seepage, boiling hot lakes in which strange creatures roil and froth. New craters form constantly as portions of the ceiling miles above fall and plummet to impact the floor. In time, the constantly collapsing ceiling may well cause subsidence in other demonic realms far above, or even break through into the Astral Plane, at which point cultists of Chavazvug hold that their god will rise in power to become a deity.

Chavazug's Cult

Chavazvug is known as the Crawling
Inferno to his worshipers, who venerate
the qlippoth lord as a patron of fiery
consumption and monstrous recursion.
For the typical worshiper of Chavazvug, nothing could be
closer to perfection than perishing from an unexpected
bout of spontaneous combustion, only to have some form
of horrific monster spawn from the steaming ashes left
behind by the supplicant's fiery doom. These worshipers
believe such a fate is a reward for service, and never seek
to trigger such combustion on their own. Worshipers of
Chavazvug tend to be solitary lunatics, arsonists, and sadists
who delight in burning helpless victims as much as they do
in the choking scent of seared flesh or the hypnotic glow
of a fiery conflagration consuming a building or woodland.
Chavazvug's sacred sites are the burnt-out husks of
buildings-particularly buildings where demonic worship
once took place.

Chavazvug's symbol is a burning tentacled rune, and
his favored weapon is the heavy flail. He grants access to
the domains of Chaos, Evil, Fire, and Repose, and to the
subdomains of Ash, Entropy, Smoke,
and Souls.

The creatures known as qlippoth (the singular and plural forms are the same) are as mysterious as they are horrifying, as one might expect of the first form of life imagined by reality. These monsters hail from a time when morality did not exist, when gods and mortals were unknown, when, perhaps, time itself had not yet begun to unfurl. Certainly, the qlippoth were old when the first proteans brought order to chaos and discovered the endless tunnels of the Abyss running through the underworld of the Outer Planes. What the race's goals and desires may have been in that unimaginably distant past is unknown, and more to the point, cannot be known to minds that have the current reality as their only point of reference. Just as reality changes what it touches, so did the introduction of the qlippoth to the reality of the Outer Planes change them. Enemies of all they encounter, they warred on any who would dare encroach upon their domains. And when no enemies dared approach, the qlippoth took their wars to others instead, boiling up out of the Abyss in seemingly endless armies.

But as vast and potent as the qlippoth may be, there are those among them that eclipse the power of them all- unique and powerful qlippoth lords that rule the deepest and darkest Abyssal depths. The number of qlippoth lords active today represents only a small fraction of those that existed at the dawn of creation. As the eons wore on, the qlippoth lords were opposed by nearly all who learned of their existence. Demon lords, archdevils, empyreal lords, and the deities themselves have taken offense at the blasphemy of the qlippoth lords, and have destroyed many of the more powerful among them. Those who remain are either shadows of the qlippoth lords' one-time glory or are so adept at hiding their true natures that none have yet glimpsed even hints of their forms.

The bulk of qlippoth lords range in strength from CR 21 to 25. More powerful creatures akin to the Horsemen or archdevils in stature may still exist in the deepest parts of the Abyss, but for now, these theoretical qlippoth demigods remain mysteries. Certainly, any active qlippoth lords are potent enough to threaten and endanger the bulk of mortal life when they choose to turn their attention to the Material Plane.

Some qlippoth have chosen to abandon their roots and accept the demonic as the new order of the Abyss. Qlippoth lords who accept sin and allow themselves to be transformed often gain a significant boost in power that catapults them out of this lower tier directly into the ranks of demon lords, but only at the cost of forever losing any tenuous alliances they may have had with the first lords of the Abyss. These former qlippoth lords are seen as the worst kind of traitors by the qlippoth and their masters, but for these qlippoth, the trade-off is more than worth it, as the power they now wield as demon lords is formidable. Demon lords who began existence as qlippoth lords include primeval entities like <a href="deitydisplaya05d.html?ItemName=Dagon">Dagon</a> and <a href="deitydisplay3054.html?ItemName=Jubilex">Jubilex</a>, but are hardly limited to these alone.

The four qlippoth lords presented on the following pages have interests in multiple Material Plane worlds. Others, such as the Polymorph Plague Yamasoth, the Warmonger Queen Shiggarreb, and the Enigma Clot Aonaurious, have focused their wrath on specific worlds or have yet to fully emerge from the deepest recesses of the Abyss to turn their attentions to the worlds beyond, and are not detailed in this book.


Qlippoth Lord Sanctums

Although the qlippoth lords are powerful, their strength does not equal that of their most hated enemies, the demon lords. But in their deepest, hidden lairs in the most remote corners of the Abyss, qlippoth lords are much more potent threats. As long as they remain in these domains (or can at least retreat there in times of need), they are well protected from retribution. These lairs are known as sanctums, and while methods of reaching and entering them are occult and obscure, a sanctum can be vast in size.

Within its sanctum, a qlippoth lord gains the following additional powers (with the exception of the mythic ability, the statistics presented on the following pages do not include these abilities). <ul><li>Mythic: A qlippoth lord functions as a <a href="rules0baf.html?Name=Mythic%20Monsters&amp;Category=Mythic%20Rules">10th-rank mythic creature</a>, including having the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). It can expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic version of any spell-like ability denoted with a superscript "M," just as if the ability were a mythic spell.</li> <li>Rejuvenation: The mind of a qlippoth lord that is slain in its sanctum merges with a qlippoth of the lord's choosing, selected from any living qlippoth within the lord's sanctum. This functions as per <a href="spelldisplayf8af.html?ItemName=mind%20swap,%20major">major mind swap</a>, except there is no save to avoid its effect and the typical qlippoth immunity to mind-affecting effects offers no protection. After 1d100 years, the qlippoth transforms into a new incarnation of its previous body as a qlippoth lord, but if slain before this transformation, the qlippoth lord is forever dead.</li> <li>A qlippoth lord can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: <a href="spelldisplay1d83.html?ItemName=astral%20projection">astral projection</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf8a0.html?ItemName=binding">binding</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf22f.html?ItemName=demand">demand</a>, <a href="spelldisplay5dd5.html?ItemName=discern%20location">discern location</a>, <a href="spelldisplayfd7c.html?ItemName=fabricate">fabricate</a>, <a href="spelldisplay36ee.html?ItemName=major%20creation">major creation</a>, <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> (limited to physical effects that manipulate the sanctum or to effects that are relevant to the qlippoth lord's interests), and <a href="spelldisplayd28c.html?ItemName=polymorph%20any%20object">polymorph any object</a> (when used on objects or creatures that are native to the sanctum, the polymorph duration factor increases by 6).</li></ul>
