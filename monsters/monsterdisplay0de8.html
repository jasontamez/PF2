Special Abilities

Bountiful Basket (Su) A fastachee carries a basket full of corn. Once per minute as a standard action, a fastachee can refill its basket with 2d6+12 ears of corn.

Plant Projection (Su) At will as a full-round action, a fastachee can project its senses through every non-creature plant within a radius of 1 mile per HD simultaneously. While projecting its senses in this way, the fastachee is flat-footed and can take no other actions. Alternatively, a fastachee can project its senses through a single ear of corn within 1 mile per HD as a free action. It continues projecting in this way for 1 round. The fastachee can treat either the corn plant it's projecting through or its own body as the origin point for any of its spells or spell-like abilities.

Sow Corn (Su) As a standard action, a fastachee can plant an ear of corn in the ground to cause a stand of 1d6 corn stalks to grow to full height and maturity in the span of 1 minute.

Spells A fastachee can cast spells as an 11th-level druid, and can spontaneously swap out any prepared druid spell for the summon nature's ally spell of the same level. A fastachee also gains access to all spells and powers of the healing domain as an 11th-level cleric.

Description

Fastachees are mysterious, wise, and generous fey who foster the growth of nearby plants. Many communities who interact with them revere them as bringers of food and medicine, as well as protectors of crops. These fey have a particularly strong connection to corn; they regularly project their senses through corn plants to monitor the health of the field and search the local area for threats. They prefer to avoid direct confrontation if possible, using their ability to originate their spells from corn plants to harass those they wish to chase away.
