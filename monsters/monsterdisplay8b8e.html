Tactics

Before Combat Before combat, the monarch casts false life, mage armor, and nondetection on herself.
During Combat A ghoul monarch avoids direct confrontation unless she can fight using dominate person or magic jar. The ghoul monarch starts combat by casting quickened grease and hungry earth, trapping as many spellcasters as she can in the effect. If the monarch has minions, she focuses on disabling and keeping enemies off guard rather than using direct damage spells. She targets powerful spellcasters with suffocation or black tentacles.
Morale A ghoul monarch flees to a safe haven or attempts to flee by burrowing underground at the first sign she is in serious danger.
Base Statistics Without false life, mage armor, and nondetection, the monarch's statistics are AC 19, touch 17, flat-footed 13; hp 161; Defensive Abilities channel resistance +2.
