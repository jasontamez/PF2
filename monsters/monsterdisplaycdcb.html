Special Abilities

Atomizer (Ex) As a full-round action once every 3 rounds, a juggernaut robot can fire a ray from its eye as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, the ray deals 15d6 points of damage. When used against an object, the atomizer disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. A creature or object that succeeds at a DC 21 Fortitude save instead takes only 5d6 points of damage. Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this attack is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected. The save DC is Intelligence-based.

Charge Fist (Ex) A juggernaut robot can charge its oversized fists with electricity as a free action, causing its slam attacks to deal 1d6 points of electricity damage. On a critical hit, a charged strike explodes with electric energy, dealing an additional 1d10 points of electricity damage. This electricity doesn't harm the juggernaut.

Combined Arms (Ex) When taking a full-attack action, a juggernaut robot can attack with its melee and ranged integrated weapons simultaneously.

Electromagnetic Pulse (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a juggernaut robot can unleash an electromagnetic pulse in a 20- foot radius that bypasses any active force fields (or similar effects) and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage to any robots or creatures with cybernetic implants. This effect doesn't harm the juggernaut robot itself or other living creatures. Creatures affected by this attack that succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save take only half the normal amount of damage. Any technological item within this radius is drained of 1d6 charges unless the item succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. The save DCs are Intelligence-based.

Force Field (Ex) A juggernaut robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 75 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a juggernaut with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the juggernaut is immune to critical hits. A juggernaut's force field has fast healing 10, but once these bonus hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.

Integrated Heavy Lasers (Ex) A juggernaut robot has a heavy laser rifle built into each of its arms. Each weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 4d10 points of fire damage. Each can fire once per round in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment. Roll to confirm each attack roll that threatens a critical hit separately.

Targeting Array (Ex) Juggernaut robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible. In addition, because of their complex array of sensors, juggernauts suffer no miss chance if a target has concealment, and reduce the miss chance from total concealment to 20%.

Vicious Trample (Ex) A juggernaut robot's massive steel feet deal 6d6+19 points of damage on a successful trample attack.

Description

Easily the rarest of all robots in Numeria, these metallic monstrosities wreak havoc upon those who trespass upon the remnants of the strange vessel that crashed into Golarion's crust eons ago. The original reasons behind the creation of such titanic constructs remains a mystery. However, the Technic League quickly surmised that these metal giants excelled at rendering other Numerian technology inert, which may give clues to the constructs' purpose. Wrought from a strange metallic alloy similar to iron and containing bizarre electronics and delicate sensors, the juggernaut rises to a height of 50 feet and weighs well over 100 tons.

Ecology

To all but a select few, the juggernaut's inner workings are an inscrutable tangle of wires, circuits, and strange metallic widgets. Its crude humanoid silhouette, complete with dangling simian-like forearms, belies its alien visage: a sleek dome with a single, unblinking ovoid eye, behind which lies a dazzling array of multihued sensors. Thick cords twist over the robot's forearms before feeding into cannon-like barrels that pulse with energy. Oversized fists crackle with lightning and explode with thunderous force upon impact. However terrible these weapons are, nothing in the juggernaut's arsenal is feared more than the ray of death that its central orb emits-a sickly hued beam that reduces all materials to a fine green dust. Luckily, this devastating attack is heralded by a series of swirling lights and high-pitched whines that mimic a colossal teapot about to explode.

Habitat and Society

These goliaths serve as sentinels to the larger shards of their shattered starship. Occasionally mistaken for enormous statuary or tributes left behind from a forgotten age, these humongous robots lie inert until the location they guard is breached. At that point, they come to life amid the loud whir of alien machinery, the stench of ozone, and the terrified screams of the intruders. Luckily, the sites these brutes guard often lie deep within Silver Mount, out of reach of all but the most determined scavengers.

Strangely, these massive constructs seem to have a close, almost paternalistic, relationship towards the more common gearsmen of Numeria. Most attempts by the Technic League to get a juggernaut to attack a functioning gearsman prove ineffective, and much like their smaller counterparts, juggernauts respond to both threats and censure with inscrutable silence.

Known Juggernaut Robots

Though the Technic League has spent decades excavating technological wonders from the wreckage of the spacecraft that crashed to Golarion so long ago, only a few of the juggernauts that have been reclaimed still have any semblance of functionality. Descriptions of the most intensively studied specimens follow.

The Living Monument: Straddling a deep crater and polished to a blinding sheen, this robot is worshiped by an indigenous tribe of Kellid warriors. Having calculated that the Kellids harbor no desire to unearth the cosmic shard that it has guarded for millennia, this juggernaut impassively tolerates the veneration it receives. The fact that its Kellid worshipers zealously oppose the Technic League's attempts to access the juggernaut causes the automaton to regard them as lesser guardians, almost as though they were gearsmen.

Specimen One: Unearthed deep beneath Silver Mount, this juggernaut was found inert within a colossal chamber. The debased arcanists of the Technic League disassembled the dormant hulk and catalogued its every wire, circuit, and cog. When they finished, they began the long, arduous process of reassembly. Unfortunately, their efforts were only partially successful. Now, only the juggernaut's massive robotic head remains "alive," forever calculating how it might escape from this pathetic existence amid a labyrinth of frayed wires, pitted alien alloys, and strange flickering bulbs.

Products of technology advanced far beyond even those of the gunsmiths of Alkenstar, robots represent constructs animated by engineering and advanced science rather than magic. The people of Golarion think of robots as "automatons" or "metal men"-their proper nomenclature is known to only a few.

The first robots arrived untold years ago, when a ship from beyond the stars smashed into Golarion. The metal vessel entered the atmosphere in a blaze of fire and broke apart, scattering fragments across the plains of Numeria. Over the following centuries, several varieties of robots emerged or were recovered from some of these ruins. A few still follow the alien dictates of their original programming, while others run amok, their directives corrupted or forgotten. Perhaps the best-known robots are the fabled gearsmen, a veritable army of humanoid robots found stored and awaiting orders in a massive hold in Silver Mount.

The means of commanding robots vary from model to model, a source of endless frustration for Numerian artificers. Some obey orders from any humanoid, some bond to a specific master until her death, and others yield only to the command of brooches or rods recovered from Silver Mount. Still others submit after mechanical surgery, or not all. A surprisingly large fraction of uncontrolled robots already speak Common or Hallit. Most models exhibit considerable linguistic talents, and the robots train each other in their new home's languages. Despite comprehending Numerian languages, most robots rarely speak save for terse acknowledgments and orders.

The Robot Subtype

"Robot" is a special subtype that can be applied to any construct without changing its CR. Robots share some features with clockwork constructs (The Inner Sea World Guide 256), and as with clockworks, you can simply remove the robot subtype and its traits to transform it into a typical construct animated by magic. A construct cannot possess both the robot and the clockwork subtypes. All robots gain the following traits, unless noted otherwise. <ul><li>Intelligent: Robots are intelligent, and thus have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice. Unless otherwise indicated for a specific robot, all robots have Intelligence scores of 10. The following are class skills for robots: Climb, Disable Device, Fly, Knowledge (all), Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive.</li><li>Vulnerable to Critical Hits: Whenever a robot takes extra damage from a critical hit, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. If it makes a successful saving throw, it is staggered for 1 round. The robot remains immune to other sources of the stunned condition.</li><li>Vulnerable to Electricity: Robots take 150% as much damage as normal from electricity attacks, unless they are immune to electricity via other special defenses.</li><li>Difficult to Create: Robots are crafted via complex methods hidden and well guarded in Numerian ruins or other technological bastions. While the Technic League has developed magical solutions to some of these requirements, actual details on creating robots are beyond the scope of this book.</li></ul>

Numerian Technology

Miraculous and deadly treasures lie in wait in Numerian dungeons, and the robots that dwell there often utilize these technological arms and tools themselves. A robot's weapons and defenses are fueled by its central energy core, and unless otherwise indicated, a robot's weapons and defenses have infinite ammunition and power.

Force Fields: A force field sheathes a robot in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants a number of bonus hit points that varies according to the robot (typically 5 x the robot's CR). All damage dealt to a robot with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. A force field has fast healing equal to the robot's CR, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.

Integrated Weaponry: A robot that has a technological weapon (such as a laser rifle or chain gun) built into its body treats such weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons attacks, and cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. Integrated weaponry can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but as a general rule cannot be harvested for use outside of the robot's body once the robot is destroyed. A robot is always proficient with its integrated weapons. Integrated ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat.

Laser Weapons: These weapons emit beams of intensely focused light waves that resolve as touch attacks and deal fire damage. A laser can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.

Plasma Weapons: These weapons emit bursts of superheated, electrically charged gas known as plasma. A plasma weapon's attacks resolve as touch attacks. Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is electricity damage.

Products of advanced scientific technology, the constructs called robots are animated by engineering and advanced science rather than magic. Most people refer to robots as "automatons" or "metal men"; their proper nomenclature is known to only a few. Unlike most constructs, robots are capable of independent thought. However, they still must obey the programming instilled in them at their creation. Any robot whose creator hard-coded limitations into its programming can never be truly autonomous.

Robots almost always arise from cultures that possess technology that is leaps and bounds ahead of other civilizations, though sometimes they appear due to cultural diffusion from such a society. A wrecked spacecraft, a portal through time, or a group of robots mass-producing others of their kind could all bring robots into a world. Robots that appear from another place or time might still follow the alien dictates of their original programming, or could run amok, their directives corrupted or forgotten. Whatever the case, these robots possess technology that is beyond the means of almost anyone to reproduce, and they represent a stark contrast to other constructs, as they have nothing to do with magic.

Some spellcasters, despite lacking any real grasp on the technological principles required to create robots, have managed to create their own robots by cobbling together spare parts and broken machines, filling in the gaps and completing the design with a mixture of magic and barely understood fragments of science. These inferior designs usually lack the inexhaustible power supplies, advanced intellects, and self-repair systems found in the original robots, and the magic used in their creation can potentially render them more susceptible to techniques that work against other sorts of constructs.

Robots serve a wide range of purposes, from warfare and defense to peaceful tasks like excavation, farming, and maintenance. Small villages that find robots and somehow manage to command them will often put them to work quietly tending fields or constructing buildings all day long. Armies and warlords collect the more dangerous varieties of robots, but even the more ordinary varieties can be deadly. Most robots sport alloyed skin as hard as steel, meaning that even the lowliest worker robot presents a potent threat when altered for battle. Furthermore, since most cultures lack a means to reliably repair or understand how to command robots, even the most benign one might malfunction, or even reach a point in its programming where it changes its activity and refuses to follow orders, leading to untold death and destruction among the its former temporary masters.

The means of commanding robots vary from model to model, which can be a source of endless frustration for any who seek to control them. Some obey orders from any humanoid, some bond to a specific master until her death, and others only yield to the command of technological brooches or control rods. Still others submit after mechanical surgery or rebuilding, or not at all. Many must be given extremely precise instructions, for they are unable to process metaphors or other figures of speech, and may interpret them in unanticipated ways, much to the chagrin of those who would command them. A surprisingly large proportion of uncontrolled robots already speak Common, as most models exhibit considerable linguistics talent, and the robots train each other in their new home's languages. Though they comprehend language, most robots rarely speak save for terse acknowledgements of orders. Their speech typically excludes words they deem unnecessary with their mechanical efficiency, leading to strange disjointed statements that convey the requisite information without emotion, although some robots programmed to interact well with humans are able to speak in a more fluid and less disconcerting manner.

Constructing a robot requires no magic, but does involve advanced and extraordinarily rare materials and technological expertise. Because almost no one possesses the skills and materials to complete the process of constructing a robot, these entries omit the construction sections provided for most constructs. A GM can add the robot subtype to a different type of construct, such as an animated object or homunculus, to create new types of robots. Typically, this doesn't alter the construct's CR. A character can't create a robot from or add the robot subtype to a construct that has already been created; adding the <a href="monstersubtypes338d.html?ItemName=Robot">robot subtype</a> to an existing creature is purely a means for the GM to simulate additional robots beyond those provided here.
