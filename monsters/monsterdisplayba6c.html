Description

Larger, more aggressive, and far more deadly than its lesser cousins, the dire bear (known to barbarian tribes variously as the cave bear or the short-faced bear) is a primeval menace indeed. This behemoth avoids more civilized reaches of the world, preferring to dwell in remote wilderness locations. A dire bear is a rare and terrifying sight-especially to those not used to normal bears.

Unlike most bears, a dire bear is short-tempered and swift to anger when confronted with intruders in its territory. Like a grizzly, a dire bear attempts to subdue or kill with its claws. However, a dire bear is far more likely (and willing) to begin biting a grabbed foe.
