Special Abilities

Divine Trigger (Su) Thalachos can activate any divine spell from a spell trigger item as if he were a 15th-level caster.

Protective Aura (Su) In addition to the normal effects of an angel's protective aura, Thalachos's aura grants the benefits of the endure elements spell.

Stun (Su) If Thalachos strikes a creature twice in the same round with his scimitars (whether two strikes with one scimitar or one strike with each), that creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.

Description

Sunlord Thalachos is Sarenrae's favorite angel, serving as her liaison to the mortal world, the hosts of astral devas, and the ranks of other celestial rulers. He is the champion of the Dawnflower and her favorite weapon against the spawn of Rovagug. The herald stands 8 feet tall and weighs 350 pounds.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
