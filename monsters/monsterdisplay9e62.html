Special Abilities

Psychogenic Secretions (Su) A xulgath's stench is far more potent than that of its troglodyte cousins. Although a xulgath's oily secretions are completely odorless, they cause any creatures (other than xulgaths) that come within 30 feet of a xulgath to immediately recall the most repugnant odor they have ever smelled. This is a mind-affecting effect, but it bypasses a vermin's immunity to mind-affecting effects. The stench assaults the mind of its victims; even if a creature succeeds at its saving throw to resist being sickened by the xulgath's stench, it takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws to resist the xulgath's psychic magic. A xulgath's nonhostile psychic powers, including its mindlink spell and ability to communicate telepathically, are also limited by the range of its stench, as its strange secretions are what allows it to form a bond between its own mind and the minds of others.

Description

Xulgaths are the proud remnants of Golarion's oncemighty troglodyte empires. While their kin have become degenerate cave dwellers, xulgaths live in cities along the lakes of Deep Tolguth. Though not the original inhabitants of these strange cities, the xulgaths zealously guard their homes from intruders. They are particularly fanatical in the defense of their central temple, a 900-foot-tall ziggurat built upon an island directly beneath Deep Tolguth's false sun. Outsiders claim that a connection exists between the sun and the temple, and attribute the xulgaths' intelligence and powers to this mysterious link.

Xulgaths use the great beasts of Deep Tolguth as mounts and guardians, and the surrounding tribes of primitive humanoids as a source of food and slaves. Xulgaths never take troglodyte slaves, preferring instead to slaughter their miserable kin on sight. They are patient and cruel, and believe it is only a matter of time before their dark gods arise and help them reclaim their fallen empire.

A typical xulgath stands nearly 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.
