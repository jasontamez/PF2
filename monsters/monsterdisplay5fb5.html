Special Abilities

Blasphemous Embrace (Ex) If the Voice of the Damned grapples a foe, it can, as a swift action, cause its pages to flense the grappled creature. The pages deal the Voice of the Damned's swarm damage. If a creature takes any of this damage, it is subject to the swarm's distraction ability and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round. The Voice can have only one embraced target at a time, but it doesn't have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the Voice moves more than 5 feet from the pages or dismisses them (a free action), the pages are rendered inanimate. Any severe or stronger wind effect or any area attack that would damage a swarm ends the embrace.

Consume (Su) If the Voice of the Damned begins its turn with an opponent in its blasphemous embrace, it can attempt a new combat maneuver check as though attempting to pin the opponent. If it succeeds, its foe takes swarm damage and vanishes into a nightmare realm within the Voice of the Damned. The target must be of Large size or smaller. The Voice of the Damned can't consume a creature that has the good subtype or that is affected by holy aura. A consumed creature takes 8d6 points of damage each round as it drifts within the Voice of the Damned's accumulated heresies. Nonevil creatures must also succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw each round or be affected as per the spell insanity, though any creature that is deafened or affected by silence or a similar effect is immune to the insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Each round on its turn, a consumed creature can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check as a full-round action. If the subject succeeds at this check on two consecutive turns, it escapes, emerging into a space adjacent to the Voice of the Damned. The Voice of the Damned cannot attempt to consume an escaped creature again until 24 hours have passed. A consumed creature can also escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Voice of the Damned is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all consumed creatures if a creature inside casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature (either inside or out) targets the Voice of the Damned with atonement, freedom, or holy word. The Voice of the Damned can expel any consumed creature as a move action, causing the victim to appear in any square adjacent to it.

Discorporate (Su) The Voice of the Damned can collapse into a cyclone of pages as a free action. All its carried, held, and worn items fall to the ground, and its Strength score drops to 1. The Voice functions as a swarm of Diminutive creatures while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (though its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the Voice maintains its defensive abilities. It loses its claw, slam, and wing natural attacks, but it can make a swarm attack and use its spell-like abilities. The Voice of the Damned can reform into its true form as a full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.

Malevolence (Su) As an immediate action, the Voice of the Damned can attempt to merge its body with a creature it has consumed. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 25th), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 32 Will saving throw. If the creature fails, the Voice of the Damned vanishes and the possessed creature reappears in its space (along with any other creatures the Voice had consumed). A creature that successfully saves is immune to the Voice's malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Master of Symbols (Su) The Voice of the Damned can speak, read, and write all languages, as per the spell tongues. It casts any spell with the word "symbol" in its name as though its casting time were a standard action, and once per day it can cast symbol of death as a swift action. Additionally, it does not need a surface on which to inscribe symbols-they merely float in the air for their duration.

Tenacious (Ex) The Voice gains a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD.

Wracking Gaze (Su) The Voice of the Damned has a gaze attack with a range of 50 feet that deals 8d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage. A creature that succeeds at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage but not the physical damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

No physical tome, no matter how magical, could ever hope to contain every facet of the multiverse's endless capacity for evil. Even if it could, the moment of the work's completion would also be the moment it became outdated. Realizing this, Tabris employed an audacious solution. He sacrificed a vestige of himself and locked it in the library-cathedrals hidden within the book's pages. These shades of Heaven's scribe were the embodiments of all he had learned of chaos, evil, good, and law, so they were perfectly suited to judge and record new developments across the planes.

Yet this act, while fulfilling Tabris's charge to record all there is to know in the multiverse, also ensured his exile from Heaven. The celestial choirs simply could not accept their brother's decision to corrupt a piece of himself to create the entity they dubbed the Voice of the Damned, which serves as the Book of the Damned's hidden caretaker. When the Book of the Damned vanished from Heaven's Great Library, many took it as proof that the Voice might be even more dangerous than they-d imagined. And in the eons since, the Voice's knowledge, obsession, and power have only grown.

The Voice of the Damned is a unique entity bound to the Book of the Damned's demiplane. It can never bodily leave that demiplane (except via its malevolence ability), and it always knows the location of every piece of the Book of the Damned. It seeks to guard the book, its repository, and the Unspeakable Word at the demiplane's center. As long as the Unspeakable Word is active, the Voice of the Damned cannot be slain for long; it resurrects 24 hours later. It can be permanently killed only if the Book of the Damned itself is destroyed.
