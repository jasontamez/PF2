Description

Revered members of the tribe, rattlers are the keepers of tradition and leaders of the sacred dances. They are the ones who remember the ancient songs of lizardfolk glory and use them to train the youth, educating each new generation in the practices and secrets that have kept their people safe in their swamps for millennia.

Though called rattlers, these lizardfolk are as much storytellers as musicians, propagating the oral traditions of their people. As a result, they are valued as much for their wisdom as for their ability to bolster the tribe's hunters and warriors in combat-though this latter responsibility admittedly defines the role in which most other humanoid races encounter them. Though a rattler might or might not be the leader of a tribe, she is often asked to sit in judgment over internal conflicts, to act as an ambassador to other tribes, or to advise a tribe's chieftains and elders so that their decisions reflect the wisdom of the past.

Lizardfolk rattlers are often tribal elders, but when youths show a propensity for bardic magic or a particular passion for the old stories and shamanistic rituals, a tribe's existing rattlers might choose to take them in and train them as the rattlers of the next generation. This practice is crucial, as it can take most of a lifetime to learn all the stories, and a tribe never wants to risk losing ties to their history because of the sudden death of the tribe's rattler to old age or in battle.
