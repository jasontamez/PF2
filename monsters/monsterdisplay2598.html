Special Abilities

Argent Armor (Ex) A destroyed argent warden can be worn as armor, provided the final blow that destroyed it did not deal more than 10 points of damage and was not an effect that disintegrates or otherwise destroys physical remains. Such a suit of armor functions as Medium +1 full plate armor for a creature that is good-aligned. Non-good creatures treat the armor as nonmagical but masterwork full plate.

Divine Grace (Su) An argent warden gains a bonus equal to its Charisma modifier (typically +3) on all saving throws.

Hellspurning Aura (Su) An argent warden imbues all weapons within 30 feet with its silvery essence. All weapons (including natural weapons) in this area are treated as if they were magic and silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

Description

In Heaven's war against Hell, the argent wardens are always present. Each a suit of armor given life in celestial forges, the argent wardens are constructed to oppose diabolism.

Construction

The suit of full plate armor that makes up the argent warden's body must be of masterwork quality.
