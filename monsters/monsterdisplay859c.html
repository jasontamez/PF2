Description

Some bugbears have an appetite for the flesh of sapient creatures, though they prefer consuming others over eating their own kind. They often keep groups of captives for weeks, killing and consuming them one at a time.

This dark-furred creature raises a spiked morningstar, its tiny, milk-white eyes glittering with the thrill of the coming kill.
