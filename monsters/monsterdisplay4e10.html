Special Abilities

Devour Soul (Su) By making a touch attack as a standard action, a devourer can deal 12d6+18 points of damage as if using a slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer's chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell's level (for sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its stats in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained-these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Spell Deflection (Su) If any of the following spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its spell resistance, they instead affect a devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.

Description

Devourers are the undead remnants of fiends and evil spellcasters who became lost beyond the farthest reaches of the multiverse. Returning with warped bodies, alien sentience, and a hunger for life, devourers threaten all souls with a terrifying, tormented annihilation. These withered corpses stand 10 feet tall but weigh a mere 200 pounds.

Variants

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8l3g">Undead Revisited pg. 13</a>
When a devourer manifests, it undergoes a dramatic transformation-one more invasive and overwhelming than those most undead transformations involve. The devourer's body and mind are reshaped and reformed by the alien influences that created it, and what remains of the source is often so fragmentary so as to constitute little more than a characteristic turn of phrase or a dreamlike memory of a life spent elsewhere.

Sometimes, however, a devourer retains a bit more of its previous personality-when this occurs, the remnants often take the form of unusual spell-like abilities. This might be a single ability-a trade of <a href="spelldisplay5433.html?ItemName=contagion">contagion</a> for <a href="spelldisplay6c8d.html?ItemName=bestow%20curse">bestow curse</a>, for example-but if the original creature was a powerful devil, daemon, or demon, these variant spell- like abilities can be quite different.

Former Devils: A devourer formed from a powerful devil sometimes has a suite of spell-like abilities that focuses more on the deception and control of living creatures. These devourers are always lawful evil. Replace the standard devourer spell-like abilities with the following at-will spell-like abilities: <a href="spelldisplay3b5b.html?ItemName=alter%20self">alter self</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya05c.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20I">beast shape I</a>, <a href="spelldisplaye96b.html?ItemName=charm%20monster">charm monster</a>, <a href="spelldisplay0d65.html?ItemName=charm%20person">charm person</a>, <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a>, <a href="spelldisplay749c.html?ItemName=invisibility">invisibility</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4b7e.html?ItemName=geas,%20lesser">lesser geas</a>, <a href="spelldisplay579d.html?ItemName=planar%20ally,%20lesser">lesser planar ally</a>, <a href="spelldisplayc8ce.html?ItemName=suggestion,%20mass">mass suggestion</a>, <a href="spelldisplay96f7.html?ItemName=scrying">scrying</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7688.html?ItemName=secret%20page">secret page</a>, <a href="spelldisplaybe5c.html?ItemName=suggestion">suggestion</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay4922.html?ItemName=summon%20monster%207">summon monster VII</a>.

Former Daemons: A devourer formed from a powerful daemon sometimes has a suite of spell-like abilities that focuses more on the destruction of living creatures and spreading fear and horror. These devourers are always neutral evil.

Former Demons: A devourer formed from a powerful demon sometimes has a suite of spell-like abilities that focuses more on destruction and devastation. These devourers are always chaotic evil.
