Leaping Charge (Ex) A velociraptor can jump while charging, allowing it to ignore difficult terrain when it charges. When a velociraptor makes a charge in this way, it deals double damage with its talons.

Description

A smaller cousin of the deinonychus, the velociraptor is a swift, cunning pack hunter. It has no fear of Medium or even Large creatures. Its leaping charge attack grants it a significant advantage against foes in thick underbrush.

A velociraptor is around 1-1/2 feet tall and 7 feet long, and weighs 35 pounds.
