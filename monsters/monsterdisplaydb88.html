Giant assassin bugs are an example of a large and varied class of hunting insects that live throughout Golarion. Assassin bugs partially bury themselves in the sand or hide among clusters of thorny bushes found near oases, waiting for the next palatable creature to approach. When prey arrives, the insects burst out of hiding and pierce their prey with their elongated mouthparts, injecting a potent toxin that paralyzes victims. Once prey is safely paralyzed, assassin bugs feed by siphoning the victim's fluids. Even if these bites don't kill their prey, they are extremely painful and cause swelling in the area. Giant assassin bugs lay eggs in places shaded from the sun at all times, such as shallow caves or the crevices between rocks, preferably in a place where food is readily available for the hatching young. The soft-bodied young that hatch resemble their mature counterparts in all ways but size, and are fully ready to hunt the moment they emerge, though they typically seek much smaller prey. An adult assassin bug is typically 4 feet long, and weighs 65 pounds.
