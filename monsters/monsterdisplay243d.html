The Prince in Chains - Monsters







Herald, The Prince in Chains

This horrid thing looks like a skinless wolf and stands taller than a house. Its oozing muscle and tissues twitch and quiver as terrible lupine maws form and melt away into its fleshless body. These fanged gashes struggle forth from the beast's gigantic mass, but are restrained by layers of heavy, rusted chains that dangle and lash, constrict and loosen seemingly of their own insidious accord. Around the hellish wolf, the world is flogged by chains and barbed tendrils, flensing all things that come near.

Special Abilities

Chainstorm (Ex) The area within 15 feet of the Prince in Chains is constantly assaulted with lashing chains and tendrils spontaneously grown from its tormented form. This area is treated as if constantly under the effects of the spell entangle, forcing any creature that enters the area to make a DC 25 Reflex save or be restrained. This save is Constitution-based. In addition, any creature in this area takes 1d12 points of damage upon entering and every round thereafter, regardless of whether or not they make their save. If the Prince in Chains moves more than 10 feet away from an entangled creature, it is released.

Exaction (Su) The Prince in Chains is treated as having fast healing 10 any round it deals damage, regardless of how much damage it deals in that round after. It recovers no hit points on rounds it does not deal damage.

Howl of Despair (Su) The Prince in Chains can loose a howl of immortal agony once every 1d4 rounds. All non-evil creatures within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 22 Will save or take 6d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, all within 10 feet who fail their saves are affected as per the spell insanity. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

No Breath (Ex) The Prince in Chains does not breathe and is immune to inhaled toxins and diseases.

Pass Without Trace (Su) The Prince in Chains is constantly affected by the spell pass without trace.

Trip (Ex) If the Prince in Chains hits with its bite attack it can attempt to trip the opponent (+5 check modifier) as a free action without making a touch attack or provoking an attack of opportunity. If the trip attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the Prince in Chains.

Vicious (Ex) Any time the Prince in Chains confirms a critical hit, in addition to increased damage it also deals 2 points of Constitution damage.

Description

The Prince in Chains is the herald of Zon-Kuthon, a living embodiment of the suffering and loss the Midnight Lord seeks to sow across the world. If the Dark Prince is an artist on the canvas of f lesh and the f ine gradations of pain are his pigments, the Prince in Chains is his dark masterpiece. The favor of the Midnight Lord has stripped the f lesh from the spiritwolf -s body and replaced it with haphazard layers of metal, leather, and the necrotic f lesh of other beings. Its tongue has been embedded with dozens of barbed hooks and razors to make its bite far more terrible and damaging. Zon-Kuthon himself gouged out the Prince in Chains's eyes to make them receptacles of his own dark will, in which it's said mortals can see the fathomless dark dreams of the god of pain himself.

The Prince in Chains stands 18 feet tall and-bound in irons forged in the depths of Xovaikain-weighs nearly 3 tons. None have ever seen the beast without his shroud of chains, the torturous bonds having become impossibly knotted with his grotesque tendrils and a fundamental part of his body.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
