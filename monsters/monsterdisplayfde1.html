Azlanti Chariot Beetle - Monsters







Azlanti Chariot Beetle

A giant beetle that looks capable of biting a full-grown horse in half suddenly bursts from the earth. As mud, dirt, and rocks cascade off its back, the thing's carapace shimmers with purple and white lights that trap the eye and dull the mind.

Special Abilities

Hypnotic Carapace (Su) Once the glimmering jeweled carapace of an azlanti chariot beetle rained arcane fire down on foes and turned aside enemy magic as easily as a tower shield does a sling stone. Now, though, these weakly shimmering magical lights only daze those within 30 feet who look upon them (Dc 15 Will save negates). The save is charisma based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Immure (Ex) The beetles are obsessed with the burial of all things. Iif the beetle successfully archives a pin against a grabbed opponent, it buries them in the earth. From that point on, the beetle no longer needs to make grapple checks to maintain the pin (although the creature may still attempt to escape the pin on his turn as normal) and is not considered grappled. the creature that is buried must begin holding his breath as soon as he is buried and may suffocate.

Description

These mighty beetles once served the Azlanti war machine. They darkened the skies on their now-withered vestigial wings with a dozen war wizards on their back. These powerful specimens possessed strange abilities that allowed them to deflect magic with ease and hurl down eldritch fire to reduce enemies to ash. After thousands of years without purpose and their masters long dead, these beetles have degenerated to barely remarkable vermin, whose once army-blasting carapace now merely sparkles weakly to befuddle the minds of those nearby. They bury nearly every creature they meet, sending their victims to join their Azlanti masters below the ground.

Environment: Azlanti chariot beetles are drawn by some lingering compulsion to the places where the Azlanti once lived, perhaps drawing energy from the magical power that still lingers in such places. They seldom stray too far from these sites.
