Aeons are a race of neutral outsiders who roam the planes maintaining the balance of reality. Aeons have the following traits. <ul><li>Immunity to cold, poison, and critical hits. </li><li>Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10. </li><li>Envisaging (Su): Aeons communicate wordlessly, almost incomprehensibly. Caring little for the wants and desires of other creatures, they have no need to engage in exchanges of dialogue. Instead, aeons mentally scan beings for their thoughts and intentions, and then retaliate with flashes of psychic projections that emit a single concept in response to whatever the other being was thinking. The flash is usually a combination of a visual and aural stimulation, which displays how the aeon perceives future events might work out. For instance, an aeon seeking to raze a city communicates this concept to non-aeons by sending them a vivid image of the city crumbling to ash. An aeon's envisaging functions as a nonverbal form of telepathy. Aeons cannot read the thoughts of any creature immune to mind-affecting effects. </li><li>Extension of All (Ex): Through an aeon's connection to the multiverse, it gains access to strange and abstruse knowledge that filters through all existence. Much of the knowledge is timeless, comprising events long past, present, and potentially even those yet to come. Aeons gain a racial bonus equal to 1/2 their racial Hit Dice on all Knowledge checks. This same connection also binds them to other aeons. As a result, they can communicate with each other freely over great distances as if using telepathy. This ability also works across planes, albeit less effectively, allowing the communication of vague impressions or feelings, not specific details or sights. Due to the vast scope of the aeon race's multiplanar concerns, though, even the most dire reports of a single aeon rarely inspire dramatic or immediate action. </li><li>Void Form (Su): Though aeons aren't incorporeal, their forms are only a semi-tangible manifestation of something greater. An aeon's void form grants it a deflection bonus equal to 1/4 its Hit Dice (rounded down).</li></ul></td>

A behemoth is a neutral Colossal magical beast of great strength and power. Behemoths possess the following traits unless otherwise noted. <ul><li>Blindsense 60 feet. </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, aging, bleed, disease, energy drain, fire, mind-affecting effects, negative levels, paralysis, permanent wounds, petrification, poison, and polymorph. Some behemoths possess additional immunities. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex) No form of attack can suppress a behemoth's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If a behemoth fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported away as a means to save a region, but the only way to truly kill a behemoth is to use <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> to negate its regeneration (see below). </li><li>DR 15/epic. </li><li>SR equal to 11 + the behemoth's CR. </li><li>Behemoths understand Aklo, but cannot speak. </li><li>Behemoths eat, but do not breathe or sleep. </li><li>Ruinous (Su) A behemoth's natural attacks penetrate damage reduction as if they were epic and magic, and ignore up to 20 points of hardness on objects struck. As a swift action, whenever it strikes a creature or object with a spell effect in place, it can attempt to dispel one randomly determined spell effect on that creature as if with a <a href="spelldisplay0568.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic,%20greater">greater dispel magic</a> (CL 20th). </li><li>Unstoppable (Ex) If a behemoth starts its turn suffering from any or all of the following conditions, it recovers from them at the end of its turn: blind, confused, dazed, deafened, dazzled, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, slowed, staggered, and stunned. </li><li>Vulnerable to Miracles and Wishes (Su) A spell effect created by a <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell is particularly effective against a behemoth. A spellcaster gains a +6 bonus on its caster level check to penetrate a behemoth's SR with a <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell, and the behemoth suffers a -6 penalty on saves against these spells. A <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> or a <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> spell can negate a behemoth's regeneration, but only for 1d4 rounds per casting.</li></ul></td>

<td><a href="monstersubtypes0c82.html?ItemName=Blight">Blight</a>

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oge?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Bestiary-6-Hardcover">Bestiary 6 pg. 302</a>
A blight is an evil and intelligent ooze that infects entire ecosystems. Unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry, blights have the following traits. <ul><li>Immunity to acid, in addition to typical ooze immunities. </li><li>Favored Terrain (Ex): A blight favors a specific type of terrain. Within its favored terrain, a blight gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. A blight in its favored terrain leaves no trail and cannot be tracked (although it can choose to leave a trail). Outside of its favored terrain, a blight loses access to its domain of evil, rejuvenation, spell-like abilities, and telepathy; it also gains the staggered condition. </li><li>Cursed Domain (Su): Blights are living epicenters for domains of evil (Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures 159). Once per year, a blight may infuse an area of its favored terrain, transforming it into a domain of evil with a radius of 5 miles (this effect does not extend beyond the natural border of the terrain). The epicenter of the domain can be identified via <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a>, for it radiates an aura of overwhelming evil in a 10-foot-radius. The epicenter of a blight's domain may be targeted by a <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> effect to temporarily lift this affliction. The DC to remove a blight's cursed domain is equal to 10 + 1/2 the blight's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier. If successful, the <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> effect suppresses the domain of evil for 1 hour per caster level, during which time the associated blight becomes sickened. The cursed domains of multiple blights can overlap, but the effects do not stack-this simply makes it more difficult to remove the curse effect since there are multiple epicenters. Since all blights have at least 10 Hit Dice, these domains of evil always become strongly evil-aligned. A blight's cursed domain has open borders, and creatures can freely enter and leave. Unlike the typical domains of evil, animals are not particularly unsettled by a blight's domain of evil. While magic and time are not affected in this cursed domain, each blight infuses the domain with a specific hazard, as detailed in the blight's entry. </li><li>Rejuvenation (Su): If a blight is slain within its cursed terrain, a new blight of the same type spontaneously forms in 1d10 days at the epicenter of the blight's cursed domain unless the blight's corpse is targeted with a <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> spell (DC = 10 + the blight's Hit Dice). </li><li>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): Once a blight establishes a cursed domain, it gains the ability to use a small suite of spell-like abilities to issue commands to plants and animals within its domain. Once per day, a blight with a cursed domain can use the following spell-like abilities, once per day each, while within its domain: <a href="spelldisplay1784.html?ItemName=blight">blight</a>, <a href="spelldisplay74b7.html?ItemName=command%20plants">command plants</a>, <a href="spelldisplay649a.html?ItemName=dominate%20monster">dominate monster</a> (animals and magical beasts only), <a href="spelldisplay38ae.html?ItemName=curse%20terrain,%20greater">greater curse terrain</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay362b.html?ItemName=hallucinatory%20terrain">hallucinatory terrain</a>. In addition, each type of blight gains an additional spell-like ability unique to its terrain, as indicated in the blight's stat block. A blight's caster level for these spell-like abilities always equals its CR. </li><li>Telepathy (Su): Blights can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature within their domain. </li><li>Vision (Ex): Unlike most oozes, blights have eyes and can see normally. In addition, all blights have blindsight to a range of 120 feet.</li></ul></td>

This subtype is usually applied to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature had a chaotic alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were chaotic-aligned (see <a href="umr276b.html?ItemName=Damage%20Reduction">Damage Reduction</a>).</td>

Clockworks are constructs created through a fusion of magic and technology. A clockwork has the following traits unless otherwise noted. <ul><li>Difficult to Create (Ex): The time and gp cost required to create a clockwork is 150% of normal. Construction requirements in individual clockwork monster entries are already increased. </li><li>Swift Reactions (Ex): Clockwork constructs generally react much more swiftly than other constructs.

Colossi are mythic constructs of Gargantuan size or larger. Unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry, colossi have the following traits. <ul><li>Alternate Form (Ex): Colossi have the ability to transform themselves into some other shape. This transformation is nonmagical, and is not revealed by <a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a> or similar magic. </li><li>Mythic Creation (Ex): A colossus can be created only by a creator with a mythic tier or rank equal to or greater than that of the colossus it is attempting to create. </li><li>Mythic Quickening (Sp): As a swift action, a colossus can expend one use of mythic power to cast or activate one of its spell-like abilities as a free action. </li><li>Mythic Resilience (Ex): A colossus can expend one use of mythic power as swift action to double its damage resistance for 1 round. </li><li>Pinning Stomp (Ex): When a colossus is in its normal form, as a swift action it can make a single melee attack at its highest base attack against a target three or more size categories smaller than the colossus. This attack deals an amount of damage equal to twice that of its slam attack + 1-1/2 times the colossus's Strength bonus. If the colossus hits with this attack, it can attempt a grapple check as a free action. This grapple doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the grapple is successful, the target is pinned and takes an amount of damage equal to that of the colossus's slam attack each round at the start of the colossus's turn until either the pinned creature frees itself or the colossus moves out of the pinned creature's space. The colossus doesn't need to attempt grapple checks to continue the pin, nor can it attempt a check to move, further damage, or tie up the grappled creature. A colossus can have at most two creatures pinned with this attack at one time. </li><li>Selective Antimagic Aura (Su): A colossus exudes a constant <a href="spelldisplay8db6.html?ItemName=antimagic%20field">antimagic field</a>, as the spell, with a radius equal to its reach. Typically, this field ignores specified schools of magic or spell descriptors. A colossus's own spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities are not affected by this aura.</li></ul></td>

This subtype is applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have it when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a Transitive Plane (the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or the Plane of Shadow).</td>

A Great Old One is a powerful, alien entity. All Great Old Ones are chaotic, and most of them are also evil. They can be any creature type, but most are aberrations or magical beasts. Great Old Ones have the following traits. <ul><li>A Great Old One's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and mythic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Although Great Old Ones grant spells to their worshipers, they don't seem to be interested in their worshipers beyond their own inscrutable ends-a Great Old One is just as likely to destroy one of its cultists as it is to destroy a nonbeliever. A Great Old One grants access to four domains and four subdomains, and its cults have a favored weapon; the exact details vary for each Great Old One. </li><li>Immortality (Ex): A Great Old One does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, nor does it age. A Great Old One that is slain does not truly die-rather, it is forced into an extended period of dormancy that can last years, centuries, or longer. Exact details of this vary and are described in individual creature entries. Methods to permanently slay a Great Old One might exist, but such methods have yet to be learned by mortals. </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, aging, cold, death effects, disease, energy drain, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, and petrification. </li><li>Insanity (Ex): Any creature that attempts to interact directly with a Great Old One's thoughts (such as via <a href="spelldisplaybf89.html?ItemName=detect%20thoughts">detect thoughts</a> or telepathy) must succeed at a Will save or be driven permanently insane. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Great Old One's Hit Dice + the Great Old One's Charisma modifier. This duplicates the effect of the <a href="spelldisplay5be0.html?ItemName=insanity">insanity</a> spell, or the <a href="rules6d29.html?Name=Sanity%20and%20Madness&amp;Category=Advanced%20Topics">insanity rules</a> (in which case the save DC is also the ongoing insanity DC). A Great Old One using its telepathy to communicate doesn't activate this ability unless it spends a standard action to focus its mind on one opponent. This is a mind-affecting effect. </li><li>Mythic (Su): A Great Old One has mythic power (10/day, surge +1d12) and counts as a 10th-rank mythic creature. A Great Old One can use any of its spell-like abilities as the mythic versions of those spells (if a mythic version of that spell exists), expending mythic power as normal. It can also expend mythic power to use the augmented versions of these spell-like abilities. </li><li>Otherworldly Insight (Ex): All Great Old Ones gain a +10 insight bonus on initiative checks and to AC. </li><li>Unspeakable Presence (Su): A Great Old One's aura inflicts intense mental anguish and torment upon all creatures within 300 feet who can see and hear the Great Old One. The exact effects caused by a Great Old One's unspeakable presence vary by type.

Unlike other aberrations, a hive creature doesn't have darkvision.</li><li>Blindsense 60 feet.</li><li>Blindsight 10 feet.</li><li>Corrosive Blood (Ex): A hive creature's blood is highly caustic. Every time the hive creature is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes acid damage according to the table below (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the hive creature has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.

This acid damages whatever surface it is on, and if it deals enough damage to destroy the surface, the acid falls down to any subsequent floor below and continues to deal damage.

These Colossal creatures inhabit the most desolate places of a world. They are often associated with elemental subtypes, and while they are only barely smarter than the typical beast, many feature personality traits that allow for rudimentary alliances or rivalries with other kaiju. Regardless, all kaiju have great capacity for devastation. A kaiju has the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>A kaiju's natural attacks count as epic and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Damage reduction 20/epic. </li><li>Darkvision 600 feet. </li><li>Fast healing 30. </li><li>Ferocity (Ex): Kaiju have the ferocity universal monster ability. </li><li>Hurl Foe (Ex): When a kaiju damages a Huge or smaller foe with one of its natural attacks, it can try to hurl the foe as part of that attack by attempting a combat maneuver check. On a successful check, the foe is knocked back 10 feet in a direction of the kaiju's choice and falls prone. The distance the foe is hurled increases by 10 feet for every 5 points by which the kaiju's check exceeds the foe's CMD. If an obstacle stops the hurled creature before it travels the whole distance, the hurled foe and the obstacle struck each take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of distance remaining and the foe is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. </li><li>Immunity to ability damage, ability drain, death effects, disease, energy drain, and fear. </li><li>Massive (Ex): Because kaiju are so massive, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to a kaiju's movement, though settlements or areas of forest are considered difficult terrain to a kaiju. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by a kaiju, and vice versa. A kaiju can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. A kaiju gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb a kaiju-this generally requires a successful DC 30 check, and unlike the normal rules about kaiju and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on a kaiju's body provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster. </li><li>Recovery (Ex): Whenever a kaiju fails a saving throw against any mind-affecting, paralysis, petrification, polymorph, or immobilizing effect (including <a href="spelldisplayf8a0.html?ItemName=binding">binding</a> and <a href="spelldisplaydf0e.html?ItemName=temporal%20stasis">temporal stasis</a>, but not including <a href="spelldisplay14fa.html?ItemName=imprisonment">imprisonment</a>), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect. Doing so does not requires an action. A kaiju can attempt a new save to end the effect as often as it wishes, but can attempt to remove only one such effect per round. Once per year, if a kaiju takes an amount of damage that would normally kill it by reducing its hit points to a negative amount equal to its Constitution score, the damage instead heals the kaiju of twice the amount of damage-but this healing leaves the kaiju disoriented and demoralized. At this point, the creature becomes nauseated and seeks only to return to its lair. Any amount of damage dealt to it by an external source before it reaches its lair, though, immediately negates the nauseated effect and allows the kaiju to end its retreat and attack. </li><li>Resistance 30 to acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative energy, and sonic.</li></ul></td>

Kami are a race of native outsiders who serve to protect what they refer to as "wards"-animals, plants, objects, and even locations-from being harmed or dishonored. All kami are outsiders with the native subtype. A kami has the following traits unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry. <ul><li>Immune to bleed, mind-affecting effects, petrification, and polymorph effects. </li><li>Resist acid 10, electricity 10, fire 10 </li><li>Telepathy. </li><li>Although they are native outsiders, kami do not eat, drink, or breathe. </li><li>Fast Healing (Ex): As long as a kami is within 120 feet of its ward, it gains fast healing. The amount of fast healing it gains depends on the type of kami. </li><li>Merge with Ward (Su): As a standard action, a kami can merge its body and mind with its ward. When merged, the kami can observe the surrounding region with its senses as if it were using its own body, as well as via any senses its ward might have. It has no control over its ward, nor can it communicate or otherwise take any action other than to emerge from its ward as a standard action. A kami must be adjacent to its ward to merge with or emerge from it. If its ward is a creature, plant, or object, the kami can emerge mounted on the creature provided the kami's body is at least one size category smaller than the creature. If its ward is a location, the kami may emerge at any point within that location. </li><li>Ward (Su): A kami has a specific ward-a creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower (usually an animal or vermin), a plant (not a plant creature), an object, or a location. The type of ward is listed in parentheses in the kami's stat block. Several of a kami's abilities function only when it is either merged with its ward or within 120 feet of it. If a kami's ward is portable and travels with the kami to another plane, the kami does not gain the extraplanar subtype on that other plane as long as its ward remains within 120 feet. If a ward is destroyed while a kami is merged with it, the kami dies (no save). If a ward is destroyed while a kami is not merged with it, the kami loses its merge with ward ability and its fast healing, and becomes permanently sickened.</li></ul></td>

This subtype is usually applied to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned Outer Planes. Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on alignment affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature had a lawful alignment, no matter what its alignment actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual alignment. A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were lawful-aligned (see <a href="umr276b.html?ItemName=Damage%20Reduction">Damage Reduction</a>).</td>

Undead within this radius (including the nightshade) gain a +2 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls and saving throws, as well as +2 hit points per die, and the save DC of channeled negative energy is increased by +6 (these adjustments are included for the nightshades in their entries). This aura can be negated by <a href="spelldisplaye385.html?ItemName=dispel%20evil">dispel evil</a>, but a nightshade can reactivate it on its turn as a free action. A desecrating aura suppresses and is suppressed by <a href="spelldisplay5b97.html?ItemName=consecrate">consecrate</a> or <a href="spelldisplaye3ec.html?ItemName=hallow">hallow</a>; both effects are negated within any overlapping area of effect. </li><li>Channel Energy (Su) A nightshade can <a href="classdisplay1daf.html?ItemName=Cleric">channel negative energy as cleric</a> of a level equal to its base CR. It can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + its Charisma modifier. </li><li>Darksense (Ex) Nightshades gain <a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a> in dim light and darkness. Regardless of light conditions, they can detect living creatures and their health within 60 feet, as blindsense with <a href="spelldisplay273d.html?ItemName=deathwatch">deathwatch</a> continuously active. <a href="spelldisplaydb45.html?ItemName=Mind%20blank">Mind blank</a> and <a href="spelldisplay32e1-2.html?ItemName=nondetection">nondetection</a> prevent the latter effect but not the nightshade's <a href="spelldisplay8ea3.html?ItemName=true%20seeing">true seeing</a>. </li><li>Light Aversion (Ex) A nightshade in bright light becomes sickened-the penalties from this condition are doubled when the nightshade is in natural sunlight. </li><li>Summon (Sp) Nightshades can summon undead creatures. They can be summoned only within areas of darkness, and summoned undead cannot create spawn. The exact type and number of undead they can summon vary according to the nightshade in question, as detailed in each nightshade's entry.</li></ul></td>

This grants it a 50% chance to ignore additional damage caused by critical hits and sneak attacks, and grants it immunity to polymorph effects (unless the protean is a willing target).

Robots are intelligent constructs created by advanced scientific means. They have the following traits, unless otherwise noted. <ul><li>Difficult to Create (Ex): Robots are crafted via complex methods hidden and well guarded. A robot does not have a construction entry. </li><li>Intelligent: Robots are intelligent, and thus have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice. Unless otherwise indicated for a specific robot, all robots have Intelligence scores of 10. The following are class skills for robots: Climb, Disable Device, Fly, Knowledge (all), Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. </li><li>Vulnerable to Critical Hits: Whenever a robot takes extra damage from a critical hit, it must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If the robot succeeds at the save, it is staggered for 1 round. The robot remains immune to all other sources of the stunned condition. </li><li>Vulnerable to Electricity: Robots take 150% as much damage as normal from electricity attacks.</li></ul> The following special abilities apply to some robots, but are not universal to all types of robot. <ul><li>Combined Arms (Ex): When making a full attack, a robot with the combined arms special attack can make all its melee natural weapon attacks plus its ranged integrated weapon attacks. </li><li>Force Field (Ex): A robot might have a force field that sheathes it in a thin layer of energy that grants a number of temporary hit points (typically 5 x the robot's CR). All damage dealt to a robot with an active force field is deducted from these temporary hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. A force field has fast healing equal to the robot's CR, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and doesn't reactivate for 24 hours.
&emsp;Format: force field (55 hp, fast healing 5); Location: hp. </li><li>Integrated Weaponry (Ex): A robot that has a technological weapon built into its body treats it as a natural weapon and not a manufactured weapon, and can't make iterative attacks with it. An integrated weapon can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as <a href="spelldisplayedfd.html?ItemName=magic%20weapon">magic weapon</a> or sunder attempts), but can't be harvested for use outside of the robot's body once the robot is destroyed. A robot is always proficient with its integrated weapons. Integrated ranged weapons don't provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat. </li><li>Laser Weapons (Ex): A laser weapon emits beams of intensely focused light waves. Laser attacks resolve as touch attacks and deal fire damage. A laser can pass through force fields and force effects like a <a href="spelldisplay5dac.html?ItemName=wall%20of%20force">wall of force</a> without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.</li></ul></td>

Such a sahkil has SR equal to 11 + its CR. </li><li>Except where otherwise noted, sahkils speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal. </li><li>Telepathy. </li><li>Easy to Call (Ex): Sahkils count as having 4 fewer Hit Dice (minimum 2) for purposes of spells or effects that call outsiders, such as <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a>.

All sahkils are immune to their own look of fear and that of other sahkils. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an opponent's space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.

A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.

Swarm Traits: A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 hit points or less causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and they cannot grapple an opponent.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <a href="spelldisplay2b8a.html?ItemName=disintegrate">disintegrate</a>), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms) if the swarm has an Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as splash weapons and many evocation spells.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a <a href="spelldisplayba00.html?ItemName=gust%20of%20wind">gust of wind</a> spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit points exceed its nonlethal damage.

Swarm Attack: Creatures with the swarm subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or cover. A swarm's statistics block has "swarm" in the Melee entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Swarm HD</td><td>Swarm Base Damage</td></tr> <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6</td></tr> <tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6</td></tr> <tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6</td></tr> <tr><td>16-20</td><td>4d6</td></tr> <tr><td>21 or more</td><td>5d6</td></tr> </table>

A swarm's attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarm's description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attack's damage to 0, being incorporeal, or other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, blood drain, poison, or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.

Swarms do not threaten creatures, and do not make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.

Swarms possess the <a href="umrfdc9.html?ItemName=Distraction">distraction</a> universal monster rule. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Will save.</td>

A troop is a collection of creatures that acts as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but as part of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A troop attempts saving throws as a single creature.

A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shapeable, though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures.

The exact number of a troop's component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures.

Troop Traits: A troop is not subject to flanking, but it is subject to critical hits and sneak attacks if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 hit points or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop. Until that point, however, any damage taken by the troop does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attacks. A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, a troop cannot be subject to a bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, drag, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuver, unless it's affected by area effects that include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent.

A troop is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <a href="spelldisplay2b8a.html?ItemName=disintegrate">disintegrate</a> and multiple-target spells such as <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a>), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>). A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage, it disperses and does not reform until its hit points exceed the nonlethal damage it has taken.

Troop Attack: Creatures with the troop subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. A troop's stat block has "troop" in its Melee entry with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below, plus its Strength modifier.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Troop HD</td><td>Troop Base Damage</td></tr> <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>16-20</td><td>4d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>21+</td><td>5d6 + Str mod</td></tr> </table>

Unless stated otherwise, a troop's attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a troop attack's damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the troop's attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage or deal more damage than their Hit Dice would normally suggest. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and resolve attacks of opportunity by dealing automatic troop damage to any foe in reach who provokes such an attack of opportunity. Troops are still limited to making one such attack per round unless the text states otherwise.

Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a successful caster level check (DC = 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.

Looting Troops: Although troops are composed of a number of individual creatures, the chaos and destruction of battle means that not all of these creatures' equipment survives the rigors of combat. As a result, parties who wish to claim usable gear or treasure from slain foes treat a troop as a single creature for the purposes of looting, and should be able to recover gear worth a total value equal to the troop's expected treasure value (as determined by the troop's CR).</td>

It never gains the extraplanar subtype. </li><li>Speak with Nature (Sp): Wild hunt creatures have <a href="spelldisplayf324.html?ItemName=know%20direction">know direction</a>, <a href="spelldisplay8821.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20animals">speak with animals</a>, and <a href="spelldisplay3ee7.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20plants">speak with plants</a> as constant spell-like abilities, and can cast <a href="spelldisplayea0c.html?ItemName=stone%20tell">stone tell</a> as a spell-like ability 3 times per day. </li><li>Wild Gaze (Su): All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save against the gaze of a member of the wild hunt instinctively recognize their power. Humanoids and monstrous humanoids stand frozen in awe, becoming paralyzed. Magical beasts and animals become frightened, and all other creatures become confused. These effects last for 1 round, and multiple failed saving throws against multiple members of the wild hunt in a single round do not cause this duration to stack. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this special attack is immune to the wild gaze from any member of the wild hunt for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. </li><li>Wild Grace (Su): Wild hunt creatures add their Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to their AC. </li><li>Wild Hunt Link (Su): Members of the wild hunt can communicate telepathically across great distances and share abilities with each other. As long as a member of the hunt is not more than 500 feet away from the nearest other member of its hunt, it can participate in the wild hunt link. Each wild hunt creature shares a different set of abilities with other creatures in the link. A lone member of the wild hunt does not gain the benefit of any abilities it grants via its wild hunt link, and identical abilities granted by multiple wild hunt fey do not stack.</li></ul>
