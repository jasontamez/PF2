Special Abilities

Gale Breath (Su) Every 1d4 rounds as a fullround
action, a ved can draw in a mighty
breath and expel it outward in a 30-foot cone.
Targets within the first 10-foot segment of this
cone must succeed at a DC 18 Strength check or be
knocked prone. Those who succeed at this check
and all other targets in the cone treat the effects
of the gale breath as a gust of wind spell. The DC
is Constitution-based.

Description

Brutish and rather stupid, veds are clannish and
shun even lightly populated areas, preferring
cold hills and mountains. Occasionally, a gang of
veds (often an adult leading two or three
adolescents) carries out raids on remote
mining camps or other establishments
in the hills, claiming the lives of a half dozen
people or so and collecting whatever baubles,
food, and useful raw materials they
find. They rarely strike against larger
settlements, and don't pursue sentient
creatures that flee their attacks.

Clans of veds usually consist of a few mated pairs, their
offspring, and one or two aged specimens that are left to
die if they become unable to pull their own weight. Veds
consider training their young a responsibility of every
adult member of the clan.

Veds enjoy simple sports that emphasize strength and
athleticism, particularly variations on tag or catch. The most
popular game veds play, called simply "topple," involves
stacking a pile of stones or logs and taking turns attempting
to blow it over. They make larger and larger stacks until one
of the competitors fails to blow it down. Even in sport, veds
are brutal, and tend to deliver a quick beating to the loser of
any game. They are pragmatic, however, and avoid injuries
that will slow the loser down.

Veds are omnivores; they prefer raw meat, but aren't
averse to consuming tree bark for nourishment. Though
they have no compunctions about killing sentient
creatures, they rarely eat them. They simply leave the
bodies to rot or-for particularly sadistic or desperate
veds-use the corpses as bait for catching wild game.

Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the veds is their
enormous lung capacity, which they are able to use
aggressively. These giants can expel air from their lungs
in a mighty blast, extinguishing small fires and knocking
prone any who stand before them. The veds then descend
on their victims, pummeling their prey viciously with
their simple but effective clubs.
