Acquired/Inherited Template Both
Simple Template No
Usable with Summons Yes

"Half-fiend" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to a living, corporeal creature with an Int score of 4 or more. A half-fiend uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: HD 4 or less, as base creature + 1; HD 5 to 10, as base creature + 2; HD 11 or more, as base creature + 3.

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to outsider (native). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.

Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +1.

Defenses/Qualities: Gains darkvision 60 feet; immunity to poison; acid, cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10; DR 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more); and SR equal to creature's CR + 11 (maximum 35).

Speed: Unless the base creature flies better, the half-fiend flies at twice the base creature's land speed (good).

Melee: A half-fiend gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. Damage depends on its size (see pages 301-302).

Special Attacks: A half-fiend gains the following.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day as a swift action the half-fiend can smite good as the smite evil ability of a paladin of the same level as the half-fiend's Hit Dice, except affecting a good target. The smite persists until the target is dead of the half-fiend rests.

Spell-Like Abilities: A half-fiend with an Int or Wis score of 8 or higher has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities set by its HD. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable 1/day. CL equals the creature's HD (or the CL of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher).

<table class="inner"><tr><td>HD</td><td>Abilities</td></tr> <tr><td>1-2</td><td>Darkness 3/day</td></tr> <tr><td>3-4</td><td>Desecrate </td></tr> <tr><td>5-6</td><td>Unholy blight</td></tr> <tr><td>7-8</td><td>Poison 3/day</td></tr> <tr><td>9-10</td><td>Contagion</td></tr> <tr><td>11-12</td><td>Blasphemy</td></tr> <tr><td>13-14</td><td>Unholy aura 3/day, unhallow</td></tr> <tr><td>15-16</td><td>Horrid wilting</td></tr> <tr><td>17-18</td><td>Summon monster IX (fiends only)</td></tr> <tr><td>19-20</td><td>Destruction</td></tr></table>
Abilities: A half-fiend gains a +4 bonus on three ability scores of its choice and a +2 bonus on the other three.

Skills: A half-fiend with racial HD has skill points per racial HD equal to 6 + Int mod. Racial class skills are unchanged, and class level skill ranks are unaffected.




Half Demons

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 3</a>
The versatile half-fiend template can be applied to any living, corporeal creature. While demons themselves do not rely upon reproduction to keep up their numbers, most demons can impregnate mortal creatures or, in some cases, can become pregnant with half-mortal offspring themselves. (See the individual chapters for specific information on this topic.) Of course, other methods can generate half-fiends as well-exposure to fecund Abyssal magic and energy, powerful ancient curses, and certain vile and blasphemous rituals may create half-fiend creatures-but demons in particular among the fiendish races are particularly and horrifically compatible with mortal humanoids. When a demon breeds with a mortal humanoid, the resulting birth is often a specific sub-category of half-fiend-a half-demon. Certain rituals can ensure that the resulting child is a half-demon rather than a half-fiend: such rituals are common in certain demon-worshiping cults, and some demons seek to sire or birth such children for their own sinister purposes.

A half-demon's statistics are generated as if they were half-fiends, save for some modifications dependent on the type of its demonic parentage. The majority of half-demons are chaotic evil. Each of the following chapters presents adjustments to the half-fiend template when generating a specific half-demon; you can use these 10 examples to generate new half-demon templates for demons not detailed in this book. If an element of the half-fiend template is not mentioned in a particular half-demon sidebar, that element is not adjusted.

Almost all half-demons are half-humanoids. It's exceptionally rare for a non-humanoid to gain this template-most such situations result in a typical half-fiend. While tieflings-humanoids with a smattering of fiendish blood-may trace their lineage back to such a union, true half-demons are far rarer and more powerful than their watered-down descendants.



Half-Babau

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 6</a>
A half-babau is skeletally thin, often with pointed ears and a single horn-like growth curling up from its skull. Its skin tone tends to be dark red, and the creature's jaws are filled with sharp, jagged teeth. They often become mass murderers, serial killers, or simply sadistic mercenaries or soldiers.

Speed: A half-babau does not gain a fly speed.

Acidic Blood (Su) A creature that attacks a half-babau with a piercing or slashing natural attack takes 1d4 points of acid damage.

Sneak Attack Expert (Ex): A half-babau instinctively knows how to strike foes to maximize pain and agony and gains sneak attack +1d6. This ability stacks with sneak attack gained from other sources.

Abilities:A half-babau gains Str +4, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +2, and Cha +2.



Half-Balor

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 12</a>
A half-balor is a hulking, muscular figure that generally stands a foot or two taller than the base creature's normal height. Half-balors possess great horns, hoofed feet, horned scales, and massive wings, and as their anger flares or as they attack, bursts of fire pulse from their frames to blast their foes. Half-balors typically rise to positions of power-they are often generals, rulers, or archvillains of the highest magnitude.

CR: A half-balor's CR is 1 higher than a half-fiend of its Hit Dice would normally be.

Natural Armor: Improves by 3.

Defensive Abilities: A half balor is immune to fire, and adds good to the qualities needed to bypass its damage reduction.

Melee: A half-balor deals +1d6 fire damage with every attack.

Alternate Spell-Like Abilities: Replace <a href="spelldisplaye72f.html?ItemName=desecrate">desecrate</a> with <a href="spelldisplayd694.html?ItemName=scorching%20ray">scorching ray</a> 3/day.

Half-Glabrezu

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 19</a>
A half-glabrezu is among the most hideous and ferocious-looking of all half-demons, for these creatures inherit their demonic parent's additional pincer arms while retaining their own arms. These pincer arms extend from the half-glabrezu's shoulders. The half-demons also have numerous horns, saurian legs that bend in three places, and patches of scaly green ridges on the shoulders and back. Despite their brutish appearances, half-glabrezus often take on roles as military, political, and even spiritual advisors who work to undermine the status quo.

Speed: A half-glabrezu does not gain a fly speed.

Melee: A half-glabrezu gains two pincer attacks and a bite attack. <a href="umr988d.html?ItemName=Natural%20Attacks">Damage depends on its size</a>. The two pincer attacks do not replace the half-glabrezu's arms, leaving those arms free to function normally, but these arms do not gain claw attacks of their own.

Half-Hezrou

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 24</a>
A half-hezrou is a bulky, rubbery-skinned beast. Among the most hideous of the half-demons, a half-hezrou tends toward obesity, further increasing its bulk with massive crusty scales or plates that constantly grow from its shoulders and back, only to flake away to be replaced by new scales. Its face tends to have protruding eyes, hanging jowls, and wide jaws, while its hands and feet are webbed. Half-hezrous are often loners, and are often involved with shady alchemical pursuits or the drug trade, or simply serve as guardians for swamp-dwelling masters.

Natural Armor: Improves by 2.

Speed: A half-hezrou does not gain a fly speed, but it does gain a swim speed equal to its base speed unless it has a faster swim speed already.

Stench (Ex): A half-hezrou exudes a foul stink of body odor mixed with swamp rot and worse. This grants the <a href="umreacf.html?ItemName=Stench">stench</a> universal monster rule, but only to a range of 10 feet. The sickened condition caused by this stench lasts for 1 minute.

Alternate Spell-Like Abilities: Replace <a href="spelldisplaye72f.html?ItemName=desecrate">desecrate</a> with <a href="spelldisplay1973.html?ItemName=gaseous%20form">gaseous form</a>.

Half-Invidiak

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 30</a>
A half-invidiak is the rarest of the half-demons, for it is only under highly specific circumstances that an invidiak can spread its legacy into the bloodline of a mortal family, due to its characteristic lack of a physical body. Half-invidiaks have dark gray skin, red eyes, fangs, and sharp talons. They tend to be painfully thin in appearance, with large shadowy wings that, despite their ghostly nature, provide excellent flight capability. A half-invidiak's envy is exceptional, and this drives it to obsessive lengths to one-up and exceed the triumphs of those with which it associates. It excels in roles where it can be served by large groups, such as cult leader or general of an army.

Speed: A half-invidiak's fly speed has perfect maneuverability.

Ghostly Form (Su): A half-invidiak can become incorporeal (along with gear it carries, up to its light encumbrance limit) for a number of rounds each day equal to its Hit Dice as a swift action. Returning to material form is a free action. The rounds per day spent incorporeal need not be consecutive. This ability cannot be activated in areas of bright light, nor can an incorporeal half-invidiak enter such an area.

Alternate Spell-Like Abilities: Replace <a href="spelldisplaye72f.html?ItemName=desecrate">desecrate</a> with <a href="spelldisplay14e2.html?ItemName=blur">blur</a>.

Half-Marilith

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 36</a>
A half-marilith has the lower body of a great serpent and four arms. Her eyes are pale (giving the appearance of having no pupils), and a short row of horns runs along the top of her head down her back. The half-marilith is a dangerous foe, and her confidence and pride make her more so, as she rarely admits defeat. Her role is typically that of a commander of an army, although she also excels as an assassin.

CR: A half-marilith's CR is +1 higher than a half-fiend of its Hit Dice would normally be.

Natural Armor: Improves by 2.

Speed: A half-marilith does not gain a fly speed.

Melee: A half-marilith gains a tail slap attack. Damage depends on her size. This tail slap attack has the <a href="umr3185.html?ItemName=Grab">grab</a> and <a href="umrd5f5.html?ItemName=Constrict">constrict</a> abilities (constriction damage equals the damage normally caused by the tail slap, but always applies the half-marilith's full Strength bonus to damage caused). She also gains two additional arms, each of which can wield weapons with ease.

Multiweapon Mastery (Ex): A half-marilith never takes penalties to her attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.

Alternate Spell-Like Abilities: Replace <a href="spelldisplaye72f.html?ItemName=desecrate">desecrate</a> with fly.

Half-Nabasu

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 42</a>
A half-nabasu has thick fur on its shoulders and back of the same color as its hair (which tends toward dark colors). It has large batlike ears and wings, a fanged mouth, and taloned fingers. Yet the half-nabasu's eyes are perhaps its most frightening feature: sunken red orbs that often glow when the creature is hungry-and half-nabasus are always hungry. A half-nabasu's favored meal is the flesh of those who share its non-demonic heritage. It is a loner and a predator, a thief and thug at best, but more often feared as a serial killer or sadist.

Resist Death: A half-nabasu is immune to death effects.

Consume Flesh (Su): Once per day, a half-nabasu can entirely consume the body of a creature of the same race as the half-nabasu's non-demonic parent-doing so takes the half-nabasu 10 minutes of grisly work, but grants the half-nabasu a +2 profane bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls, as well as to its AC. In addition, the act grants the half-nabasu 2 temporary hit points per Hit Dice. These effects last for 1 hour per Hit Dice.

Alternate Spell-Like Abilities: Replace <a href="spelldisplaye72f.html?ItemName=desecrate">desecrate</a> with <a href="spelldisplay672f.html?ItemName=silence">silence</a>.

Half-Nalfeshnee

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 48</a>
A half-nalfeshnee is a towering foe; it generally stands a foot or two taller than is typical for its non-demonic parent (this increase in height does not increase the half-demon's actual size category). The creature's visage is hideously porcine, with jutting lower teeth and tiny, beady eyes. Small, feathered wings protrude from its back, while its overly large hands end in sharp nails. Patches of bristly fur sit on its arms, back, and legs. Most half-nalfeshnees seek material wealth over all else, and they can often be found ruling powerful merchant guilds or thieves' guilds.

Speed: A half-nalfeshnee's fly speed is equal to its base speed, and has clumsy maneuverability.

Unholy Flash (Su): Once per day as a free action, a half-nalfeshnee can infuse its aura with a writhing mass of nauseating colors. One round later, at the start of the half-nalfeshnee's turn, this aura bursts in a 20-foot radius. Any non-demon creature caught in this area must succeed on a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the half-demon's HD + the half-demon's Cha modifier) or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds.

Alternate Spell-Like Abilities: Replace <a href="spelldisplay50b2.html?ItemName=poison">poison</a> 3/day with <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> 3/day.

Abilities:A half-nalfeshnee gains Str +6, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +2, and Cha +4.



Half-Succubus

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 54</a>
A half-succubus is the most humanoid-appearing of all the half-demons, yet she is still immediately recognizable for what she is unless she takes pains to disguise herself. She typically appears nearly identical in appearance to a full succubus, and can easily be mistaken for a full demon. A half-succubus revels in roles that allow her to satisfy her overwhelming lust-many run brothels or work as prostitutes, but the most dangerous are those who have managed to control their lusts and work as assassins or spies.

Passion (Su): A half-succubus drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion-unwilling victims must be grappled before the half-succubus can use this ability. The passion bestows one negative level. A half=succubus can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Hit Dice. The save DC to remove one of these negative levels is equal to 10 + the half-succubus's HD + her Cha modifier.

Change Shape (Su): A half-succubus can use this ability to assume the form of any humanoid creature of her size, as if using alter self, once per day.

Half-Vrock

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8yvo?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Demons-Revisited">Demons Revisited pg. 60</a>
A half-vrock has a hideous face that resembles the hooked visage of a vulture. Instead of hair, it has oily black feathers, which cover its large wings as well. Its hands end in sharp talons and it has a long, thin tail. Half-vrocks often serve as mercenaries or soldiers, pursuits in which their tendency to react to any perceived slight with violence is an advantage more often than not.

Spores (Ex): A half-vrock is covered with a fine layer of spores. As a free action, it can infest a creature it hits with a melee attack with these spores; the vrock must wait a minute before using its spores again. A creature targeted by a half-vrock's spores becomes sickened by the pain caused by the spores for 2d4 rounds as they raise hideous welts on the victim's flesh. This is a disease effect.

Shriek (Su): Once per day, a half-vrock can utter a shrill screech. All creatures except demons within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the half-vrock's HD + the half-vrock's Con modifier) or be staggered for 1 round.
