Nulmind - Monsters







Nulmind

This thick ribbon of fungus somewhat resembles a caterpillar. Its folds pulse with an eerie, golden incandescence.

Special Abilities

Devour Magic (Ex) When a creature
casts a spell within 30 feet of a
nulmind, the nulmind gains
1 PE. If the spell was a
psychic spell, the
nulmind instead gains
a number of PE equal to
the level of the spell.

Mind Drain Aura (Su) Any
creature within 30 feet of a nulmind must succeed at a DC 23
Will save each round or take 1d3 points of Intelligence damage.
A nulmind can control all creatures within its aura that have an
amount of Intelligence damage greater than their Intelligence
scores as if those creatures were dominated (this suppresses
the usual coma that results from such damage).

Mind Spores (Sp) A creature hit by a nulmind's spores takes
damage as if it failed its saving throw against mind thrust I.

Description

The tremendously dangerous nulmind is a fungal creature
believed by many sages to have extraterrestrial origins. It
is drawn to areas of innate magical power or populated
by spellcasters, feasting off the magic in the area while
slowly wearing down the inhabitants' mental faculties
with mind-numbing thoughts and images. Users of
psychic magic prove to be favored targets, as their mental
energy is especially empowering to the fungi. A creature
that succumbs to a nulmind's mind drain aura might
eventually become enslaved to the fungus's alien will,
the nulmind using such unfortunate creatures to draw in
further prey. A creature enslaved in this way is incapable
of seeing to even its own basic needs, becoming a simple
extension of the nulmind's need to feed.

Left unchecked, a nulmind rapidly depletes the local
wildlife, as its mindless servants starve to death. Animal
life provides very little sustenance for the creature, and
a nulmind inevitably works to find richer sources of
intelligence and spell power to devour. This sometimes
leads the fungus to communities on the border of its forest
or to gravitate toward woodland-bound druidic circles.
Because of this, druid enclaves often actively
hunt and destroy these creatures before they
can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem.
Despite the fungi's plantlike nature, most
druidic communities view nulminds as
anathema to the natural order.

Nulminds are fortunately rare, with
no documented culture or organization.
These creatures rarely work well in
concert, as each is ultimately selfish
and sees only to its own needs, draining
even its fellows without hesitation. Despite
their insatiability, nulminds seem to
lack a taste for the mental energy of fey
creatures. While the fungi still defend
themselves against fey creatures,
they go out of their way to avoid
areas where such creatures live.

A nulmind moves by
compressing and shifting its
body, creeping slowly like a
caterpillar. A nulmind is about
3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.
