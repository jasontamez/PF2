Description

The following template can be used to create unique vampire spawn with class levels.

Creating a Vampire Spawn

"Vampire spawn" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 4 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A vampire spawn uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as the base creature + 1.
Alignment: Any evil.
Type: The creature's type changes to undead. Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.
Senses: A vampire spawn gains darkvision to 60 feet.
Armor Class: Natural armor increases to +4, unless the base creature's natural armor is already +4 or higher.
Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vampire spawn use their Cha modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Con).
Defensive Abilities: A vampire spawn gains channel resistance +2, DR 5/silver, resistance 10 against cold and electricity, and fast healing 2.
Weaknesses: A vampire spawn has the same weaknesses of the vampire that created it.

Resurrection Vulnerability (Su): A raise dead or similar spell cast on a vampire spawn destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

Melee: A vampire spawn gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends on the vampire spawn's size (see Bestiary 301).
Special Attacks: A vampire spawn gains a vampire's blood drain and dominate special attacks. The vampire who created the spawn can influence a spawn's dominated creature as if she had dominated it herself.

Energy Drain (Su): A creature hit by a vampire spawn's slam (or other natural weapon) gains 1 negative level. This ability only triggers only once per round.

Special Qualities: A vampire spawn gains the gaseous form, shadowless, and spider climb abilities of a vampire.
Ability Scores: Cha +2.
Skills: Spawn gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks.
Feats: Spawn gain Skill Focus (Perception) as a bonus feat.
