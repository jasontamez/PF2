Tactics

Before Combat The ancient gravedigger prepares for combat by quaffing potions of greater magic fang and mage armor. He uses earth glide and crystal sight to observe foes fighting his underlings before he attacks.
During Combat The ancient gravedigger prefers to fight at range, relying on summoned creatures, flame strike, and spiritual weapon to deal damage while he uses earth glide and crystal sight to take cover from the fray. If he must enter melee, the gravedigger fights viciously.
