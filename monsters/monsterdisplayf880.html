Special Abilities

Hallucination (Su) A living creature that starts her turn within
60 feet of a lotus tree or eats its fruit hallucinates pleasantly
as per synesthesia (DC 30 Will negates) for 4d6 hours. The
hallucinations include a humanoid figure of shifting colors
that conveys the tree's telepathy and thoughtsense across
any range, allowing the hallucinating creature to act as
the tree's proxy. Suppressing or resuming the aura is a free
action. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Hope Theft (Sp) As a swift action at unlimited range, a lotus tree
can permanently charm a hallucinating creature (as per mass
charm monster but with no save bonus for hostility) unless it
succeeds at a DC 29 Will save. Affected victims forget all longterm
goals, desiring only more hallucinations, and grant the
tree temporary PE equal to half their Hit Dice and 5 times that
amount in temporary hit points for 1 day. Regardless of the
save, the target automatically is affected as per mindwipe.

Description

Lotus trees grow in ancient forests and paradisiacal islands,
feeding on the fantasies of sentient beings. Some lotus trees
are curious and wise; others hoard secrets while claiming
they provide refuge from reality. Intentionally or not, lotus
trees attract those seeking wisdom or dreamy escape.
