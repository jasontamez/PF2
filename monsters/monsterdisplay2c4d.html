Special Abilities

Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a wight becomes a wight itself in only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

Description

Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre-a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy.

As undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they are sometimes found underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers unless they were originally swimming creatures such as aquatic elves or merfolk. Underwater wights prefer low-ceilinged caves where their limited swimming isn't as much of a liability.

The wight presented here is a typical example of its kind, but sometimes when a wight creates spawn from particularly unusual humanoids, the resulting wights are quite different in power, such as the following three variants.

Brute Wight (CR 5): Giants that are killed by wights become hunchbacked, simple-minded undead. Brute wights are giant advanced wights, but cannot create spawn of their own.

Cairn Wight (CR 4): Some societies deliberately create these specialized wights to serve as guardians for barrows or other burial sites. A cairn wight is an advanced wight that fights with a weapon, typically a sword, that channels its energy drain attack and affects creatures damaged by the weapon as if they had been struck by the wight's slam attack.

Frost Wight (CR 4): Wights created in cold environments sometimes become pale undead with blue-white eyes and ice in their hair. Frost wights have the cold subtype and their slam attacks deal 1d6 cold damage in addition to the normal effects. A creature touching a frost wight with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 cold damage.

Variants

Wights arise in many ways, and their particular origins often influence the abilities they possess.

Dust Wight (+1 CR): Just as wights that rise from the dead in frozen environments can become infused with the dangerous qualities of their harsh environs, dust wights carry in their desiccated, crumbling frames the scorching punishment of the searing desert. These wights are typically found in desert tombs or ruins, and have fiery orange eyes and very little flesh save for leathery scraps clinging to their bones. A dust wight gains DR 5/ bludgeoning, and when it hits a foe with its slam attack, causes the creature struck to become dehydrated if this victim fails a Fortitude save (same DC as the wight's energy drain attack). A dehydrated foe becomes fatigued (or exhausted if already fatigued).

Mist Wight (+1 CR): A mist wight can exhale black breath at will as a standard action, creating a 10-foot cube of thick mist that acts as <a href="spelldisplay1e86.html?ItemName=Obscuring%20mist">obscuring mist</a>. This tainted air causes living creatures to become fatigued as long as they remain within the mist and for 1 round thereafter. The cloud of mist remains in place for 1 round per HD possessed by the mist wight. Once per day, a mist wight can infuse its breath with the choking stench of the grave, creating an effect identical to a <a href="spelldisplay1ff3.html?ItemName=Stinking%20cloud">stinking cloud</a> (Fortitude DC 14 negates; the save DC is Charisma-based). Mist wights can sense the subtle intake of breath in creatures around them, and they gain blindsense 60 feet against living creatures who aren't holding their breath.

Accursed Treasure

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpy8l3g">Undead Revisited pg. 55</a>
A wight's treasure can become infused with its dark spirit, creating a gnawing, obsessive greed that saps the spirit and life of any creature that claims it. A character that possesses accursed wight treasure gains a number of negative levels equal to the total gp value of the stolen treasure divided by 10,000 (minimum of one negative level). These negative levels remain as long as the creature retains ownership of the treasure (even if this treasure is not carried)-they disappear as soon as the stolen treasure is destroyed, stolen, freely given away, or returned to the wight's lair. If the treasure is merely sold, the negative levels become permanent negative levels that can then be removed via means like <a href="spelldisplay8e95.html?ItemName=Restoration">restoration</a>.

A creature whose negative levels equal its Hit Dice perishes and rises as a wight. If the wight whose treasure it stole still exists, it becomes a wight spawn bound to that wight. If not, it becomes a free-willed wight. Removing these negative levels does not end the curse, but <a href="spelldisplayd486.html?ItemName=Remove%20Curse">remove curse</a> or <a href="spelldisplayf177.html?ItemName=Break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> does, with a caster level check against a DC equal to the wight's energy drain save DC. A wight's treasure does not confer negative levels while in the area of a <a href="spelldisplay5191.html?ItemName=Hallow">hallow</a> spel
