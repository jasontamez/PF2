Special Abilities

Empyrean Insights (Ex) Empyreans have insight into the way creatures act, and it serves them well in battle. Empyreans gain an insight bonus to their Armor Class equal to their Charisma bonuses.

Heed No Call (Ex) Empyreans are ancient beyond measure and directly serve the gods. They are immune to all calling spells, unless they choose to allow themselves to be called.

Lucent Arms (Ex) An empyrean infuses its weapons with its own inner light. Any weapon an empyrean wields gains the holy and merciful special abilities. The empyrean can suppress the merciful special ability on command as normal. An empyrean needs no ammunition for its bow (or for any other ranged weapon it may possess), as it can simply fire arrows of light. An empyrean's weapons count as having the brilliant energy special ability whenever it would be beneficial to the empyrean.

Lucent Body (Ex) Each empyrean is formed of the ancient essence of good. Its lucent body melds perfectly with its armor and clothing, forming a single whole. An empyrean gains a sacred bonus to its Armor Class equal to the total armor bonus of its infused armor (typically +14 from infused +5 full plate), but it suffers no restrictions or penalties for wearing armor. An empyrean can never gain an armor bonus or natural armor bonus to its Armor Class through any means.

Spells Empyreans can cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.

Description

Empyreans are a race of ancient angels created by the gods before the dawn of mortalkind. Among the angelic hosts, empyreans serve outside of the usual chain of command. Standing 15 feet tall and clad in the trappings of mortality, which wrap their brilliant forms in a shape mortals and other angels can easily understand, empyreans are physical embodiments of the good energy of a deity or deific being, and they answer only to that higher power.

While other angels arise from an amalgam of good souls or the soul of an ascended mortal, the birth of a new empyrean is a momentous event, for it occurs only if another empyrean is slain. To fill the void, the remaining empyreans temporarily become receptive to the energy of good deities other than their original progenitors, which can eventually cause an empyrean to split in two. The offspring empyrean shares many of the memories and personality traits of the original, but its power is influenced by the deity who sparked its creation.

Empyreans serve as secret agents for deities-operatives who can be trusted to perform sensitive tasks, especially those that require a long view. Unlike solars, who often become slayers of great evils, empyreans rarely pick fights, but when they do, they prefer to use their deities' favorite weapons.



Empyrean Paragons

Empyrean paragons stand among the most powerful servants of good deities, and a given deity can have at most one paragon. Empyrean paragons vary from CR 23 to CR 30. Each paragon possesses a unique ability tied to its deity. The following are a few examples of such powers.

Paragon of the Dawn (Ex): The paragon glows like the sun, shining light in a radius of up to 1 mile. This light automatically shines through and dispels all effects with the darkness descriptor, and counts as true sunlight for all purposes (including harming undead that are vulnerable to sunlight).

Paragon of the Rose (Su): The paragon is surrounded by rose petals and songbirds. It gains a 30-foot aura that has the effects of euphoric tranquility and that affects creatures for as long as they remain in the aura and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that succeeds at its Will save ends the effect completely, but if the effect expires naturally, the creature can accept the effects of an atonement spell to change its alignment to neutral good. Either way, the creature is immune to this ability's effects for 24 hours.

Paragon of the Shield (Ex): The paragon's protective aura is extraordinarily powerful. It acts as a globe of invulnerability instead of a lesser globe of invulnerability, and all allies within the aura except the paragon take half damage from all attacks.

Paragon of the Sword (Sp, Su): The paragon's blade is fueled by honor. The paragon is lawful good and gains bestow grace of the champion as a constant spell-like ability, except the paragon counts as a 20th-level paladin for the purposes of lay on hands and smite evil and gains the number of daily uses of each that it would as a 20th-level paladin.

Angels are a race of celestials, beings who live on the good-aligned outer planes.

Angels can be of any good alignment. Lawful angels hail from Heaven, neutral angels from Nirvana, and chaotic angels from Elysium, though the majority serve one good deity or another and call their patron's realm their home. Most mortals assume that angels never lie, cheat, or steal, are impeccably honorable in all their dealings, and are the most trustworthy and diplomatic of all the celestials; while this is generally true, there are exceptions, especially as some angels serve good-aligned trickster gods and other chaotic entities.

The original and most powerful angels predate the mortal races. They were among the first creations of the gods of good, and those that survive to this day are among the more powerful non-divine beings in the multiverse. While new angels are still periodically created by the gods, most modern angels were once good mortals, their souls transforming into something greater upon reaching their destination in the planes. Often an angel's true form is reminiscent of its mortal self, only taller, brighter, and more powerful. The relationship between good mortal soul and angel is common knowledge, and many mortal religions assume that all members of the faith in good standing become angels of some type in the afterlife. Others confuse the issue by conflating famous mortals (such as saints and martyrs) with preexisting angels that have similar names, or suggesting that angels take human form to perform great deeds as mortals, returning to the heavens when their duties are over.

All angels are blessed with extraordinary beauty, though their actual appearances vary widely. Their natural shapechanging ability means they may appear to mortals as male or female, depending on their personal preference or the will of their deity. As they are spiritual creatures given a physical form rather than creatures of flesh born of other creatures, their gender is mutable; some angels always use a male form, some strictly a female one, and others use either or both, or prefer an androgynous or sexless shape.

Technically, the word "angel" refers to several types of humanoid angels-solars, planetars, and devas (of which the astral deva is the most common; other types exist as well)-though many mortals use the term loosely and apply it to any celestial, whether an angel, one of the guardian archons, fey-like azatas, beast-like agathions, or any other creature of the good planes. The angels do not take affront at this, as they have more important things to deal with than mortal nomenclature.

Angels speak Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal, though they can communicate with almost any creature because of their truespeech ability. All angels possess a number of similar traits. Most angels also have additional powers beyond these traits, depending on the role their deity assigns them. For example, an angelic guardian of volcanoes might have the fire subtype, or the protector of a sunken city might be aquatic, amphibious, and able to use her wings to swim.

Fallen Angels

Many religions include stories of angels rebelling against a creator or becoming corrupt and evil. Sadly, this is indeed possible, though thankfully rare, and only the proudest or weakest-willed angels succumb to this fate. Fallen angels are exiles of the good realms, hunted by their former brethren and easy targets for fiends as well. The fallen lose some of the grace and light of their untainted kin, though many are said to still be tragically beautiful. Rarer still are those fallen angels strong and clever enough to join the legions of Hell, and who are often transformed into some type of devil, or those who become demons of the Abyss and carve out a niche in that horrible realm or come to serve a greater demon.

Angelic Choirs

Whereas there are evil and cruel counterparts for all the other good races, the legions of fiends do not possess a clear analogue for the race of angels. Many scholars have debated the reasons for this strange lack of symmetry among the good and evil outsiders, and while most have come to believe that this is simply an example of good's inherent willingness to rise above specific alignments for everyone's benefit, the exact reason may never be known.

Since angels can be of any good alignment, they represent the needs and desires of all three major good outsider races. While some angels devote their energies to all three, most have a particular favorite among the races in keeping with that angel's particular alignment. While their true forms never vary between alignments, angels will often use their change shape ability to appear more like an archon, agathion, or azata as the situation and the angel's personality demands.

Angels are further subdivided into their own specific hierarchy known as the Triad of Choirs. The bulk of the angel race consists of the devas-these are the most common angels, and numerous different specialties exist, with the astral deva presented here merely the best known. Devas of the third choir have two wings. The second choir consists solely of the four-winged planetars, while the rulers of the angelic race are the six-winged solars. These are the mightiest of all angels, and the most powerful of them can directly oppose even the will of a demigod if the situation calls for it.

Angel Subtype

Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned outer planes. An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision.</li><li>Immunity to acid, cold, and petrification.</li><li>Resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.</li><li>+4 racial bonus on saves against poison.</li><li>Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals angel's HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel's statistics block.</li><li>Truespeech (Su) All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.</li></ul>
