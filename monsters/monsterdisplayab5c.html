wings create an iridescent glow as it buzzes through the air.

Special Abilities

Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round
for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.
Static Discharge (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as part of
a move action that's taken to fly at least 10 feet, a
warmonger wasp's wings can discharge a bolt of electricity
to a range of up to 60 feet. The bolt explodes upon
reaching its target, creating a 20-foot-radius burst that
deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 15 half).
The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Like the more powerful retriever, the warmonger wasp is a construct built
from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of
the Abyss itself. Partially organic and partially metallic,
warmonger wasps serve demonic armies as air support
in large battles. Their electricity-based explosions work
well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as
electrical attacks have no effect on demons. Warmonger
wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the
procedure of crafting these constructs is beyond the ken
of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do
their bidding. Warmonger wasps are only intelligent
enough to understand simple commands, and even then
they generally understand only commands universally
associated with battlefield conditions.

A warmonger wasp is about 10 feet long, has a 20-foot
wingspan, and weighs 1,200 pounds.

Conjuring a Warmonger Wasp

Although a warmonger wasp is not an outsider, it may
nonetheless be conjured by either a planar ally or planar
binding spell. The spellcaster must take care
when doing so, however, using specially
prepared incenses, the secretions of rare
and violent insects, and complex
diagrams drawn with expensive
phosphorescent inks, lest the
wasp attack the spellcaster upon
the spell's completion. These
components cost 15,000 gp
and replace the usual costs
associated with casting
either spell (including
the required Charisma
check to browbeat the
creature into servitude
with planar binding,
as well as planar ally's
requirement to pay the
conjured creature).

Massacre Wasp

Warmonger wasps grow organically from protoplasmic
flesh and chaos, so it's no surprise that, unlike many
constructs, each warmonger wasp has a uniquely terrible
appearance, and the wasps warp, twist, and mutate over
time. While in most cases, significant mutations prove
crippling and ultimately cause the wasp's death, in rare
cases, the mutated wasp reaches a new state of evolution and
becomes a massacre wasp: a more powerful version of the
warmonger wasp that is capable of strategizing and leading
other warmonger wasps in battlefield maneuvers. Massacre
wasps usually have the advanced or giant simple template
as well as either 6 evolution points' worth of summoner
eidolon evolutions or other monster abilities of a similar
power level and scope. Massacre wasps' static discharge
works once per round instead of once every 1d4 rounds.
