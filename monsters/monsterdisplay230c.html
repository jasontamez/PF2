Special Abilities

Chaos Aura (Su) A vescavor queen is an embodiment of chaos.
Its aura is a font of anarchic energy that grants fast healing
2 to the vescavor queen, as well as to any vescavor swarm
within 10 feet of the queen. A vescavor queen can activate
or suppress this ability as a free action.
Gibber (Su) Like their broods, vescavor queens yammer the
endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of
a vescavor queen must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be
confused for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves can't
be affected by the same vescavor queen's gibbering for 24
hours. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
Spit Acid (Ex) As a standard action, a vescavor queen can
make a ranged touch attack to spit acid at a foe within
30 feet. A target hit by this glob of acid takes 5d6 points
of acid damage. In addition, the spit of a vescavor queen
contains some of its pheromones. Any target that takes
damage from this attack acts as a beacon for vescavor
swarms; the damaged creature takes a -8 penalty on
Stealth checks against the vescavor queen and swarms it
controls, and likely becomes the swarm's next target.
Swarm Mother (Su) A vescavor queen can mentally
control up to 20 Hit Dice of vescavor swarms through
a combination of pheromones and supernatural
manipulation. To control a vescavor swarm, the vescavor
queen must be able to see it and must be within 120 feet
of it. Attempting to control a vescavor swarm is a standard
action, and the swarm can attempt to resist this attempt
with a DC 17 Will save. If the swarm fails this save, the
vescavor queen can issue a simple mental command as a
swift action, such as "fight," "come here," "go there," or
"stay still." Vescavor swarms affected by this ability act
normally unless a vescavor queen is actively controlling
them, but never attack the vescavor queen. The save DC
is Charisma-based. In addition, whether or not it controls
the swarm, a vescavor queen is immune to a vescavor
swarm's swarm attacks and supernatural special abilities.
A vescavor queen can release a vescavor swarm from its
control as a free action. If a vescavor queen is killed, any
vescavor swarms under its control disperse.

Description

Appearing as an amalgam of twisted, unnatural insects,
a vescavor queen is a hideous sight to behold, even among
the terrifying denizens of the Abyss. Not only is a queen's
bite stronger than that of its spawn, but the queen can
also spit acid at opponents, and its arms end in scything
claws poised to rend through flesh and armor. Vescavor
swarms instinctively obey a queen, eagerly seeking out
those foes marked by the queen's attacks. A vescavor
queen measures roughly 10 feet from head to tail, and
weighs nearly 500 pounds' more when carrying a brood.
