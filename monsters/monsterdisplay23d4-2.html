Ningyo - Monsters







<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Ningyo

This hideous sea monstrosity combines the most ferocious features of simian and carp, its fish-like tail sprouting a grotesquely primitive humanoid torso, head, and limbs. Although little more than 2 feet long, the nasty thing gibbers wildly as it gnashes its curling fangs and swipes at prey with webbed claws.

Special Abilities

Group Grapplers (Ex) Ningyos excel at swarming over foes, dragging them down to drown or tearing them to bits with their tiny claws and jaws. Ningyos gain a +2 bonus on checks to aid other ningyos. In addition, when a ningyo aids another ningyo in a grapple, it adds +2 on its ally's grapple check and increases the amount of damage dealt by the grapple by +2. These bonuses on grapple checks and grapple damage stack when multiple ningyos aid in a grapple, up to a maximum of five ningyos.

Nocturnal Undeath (Su) The body of a ningyo never rests peacefully. One hour after dusk, an intact ningyo corpse reanimates, becoming an undead creature (its statistics changing from a ningyo to an undead ningyo). At dawn, the undead ningyo returns to a state of true death until the next night. Undead-affecting effects like channel energy and detect undead have no effect on a ningyo corpse during the day. An undead ningyo always knows when the dawn is coming and uses the 15 minutes before daybreak to shelter itself as best it can. A ningyo missing any significant part of its body-a limb or more-does not animate at night, though it will if the missing body part is ever placed back in contact with its body. A ningyo corpse that is burned or torn apart to an extent that its pieces never meet again does not rise as an undead.

Poison Flesh (Ex) Any creature that uses a bite attack against a ningyo, swallows a ningyo whole, or otherwise consumes part of a ningyo exposes itself to the creature's toxic flesh.

Ningyo Flesh: Ingested; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1 minutes; effect 1d2 Int damage; cure 2 saves.

Description

The bane of fishermen and divers, ningyos lurk in tropical waters, gorging themselves on fish and attacking anything they can sink their tiny fangs into. Nasty little things, these primitive, miniature mer-monsters are bogeymen of the sea, often attacking seagoers, ships, and fishing tackle out of both blind ravenousness and blunt stupidity. With little more organization or society than a school of sharks, these cannibalistic half-simian, half-fish terrors swarm by night and can easily drag those caught on moonlit waters down to drown amid a sea of tiny claws and needling teeth.

Yet for all their animal ferocity, ningyos are most notorious for their unquiet deaths. Said by natives to be too mean and stupid to die, a slain ningyo always returns to life by night, obliviously adopting old habits or dragging itself forth from the water to find its killer. By day, though, undead ningyos turn back into normal corpses, sometimes washing up on shore as gruesome and fascinating-but potentially deadly-curiosities. While the knowledgeable burn the eerie corpses they find along the coast, more than one foolhardy beachcomber has collected such an oddity, only to later awake in terror, the tiny withered claws and broken teeth of his weird curio savaging him in the dark.

Ningyos measure approximately 2 to 2-1/2 feet long from head to tail, and weigh 6 to 9 pounds.
