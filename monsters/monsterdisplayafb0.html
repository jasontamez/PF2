Yangethe

This six-eyed horror is vaguely shaped like a dead tree, but one with claws and tentacles and spidery legs.

Special Abilities

Feeding Tentacles (Su) As a
standard action, a yangethe
can use its mouth tentacles to
feed on a helpless creature or a
creature it is currently grappling. In this
case, if the yangethe hits with a melee touch attack, the
feeding tentacles wrap around the target's body and riddle
it with thousands of tiny filaments that siphon away the
victim's emotions. This attack deals 1d4 points of Charisma
drain. The yangethe heals 5 points of damage for every point
of Charisma it drains in this manner. As long as a creature
continues to suffer any of this Charisma drain, each time it
attempts to sleep, it is affected by a nightmare spell (CL 10th,
DC 20) and has terrifying dreams wherein the experience of
being fed upon by the yangethe takes on greater and greater
levels of horror. All effects from the feeding tentacles are
mind-affecting effects.

Psychic Blast (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a
yangethe can emit a blast of psychic energy from its mind in
a 30-foot-radius burst centered on itself. All creatures in this
area take 6d6 points of nonlethal damage from the intense
pain and are confused for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 18 Will
save halves the damage and negates the confusion. This is a
mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

One of the countless creatures bred and engineered by
eldritch horrors from beyond the stars, yangethes have, over
the eons, developed keen intellects and desires of their own.
Unless slain by violence, a yangethe is immortal.
