Vampiric creatures have been transformed into vampires, and they don't have to be humanoids. At your discretion, a vampiric creature might have the create spawn ability and could create spawn of its own creature type in addition to humanoid spawn. Non-humanoid vampiric creatures likely have unusual "coffins" that befit their nature.
