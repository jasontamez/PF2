Special Abilities

Dilating Strike (Ex) A time dimensional's attacks slow the flow of local time around its target. A creature hit by a time dimensional's slam attack must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected by slow for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not it succeeds at the saving throw, a creature cannot be affected again by this ability for 1 minute. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Omniobservant (Ex) A time dimensional has nearly perfect information about the passage of time in its vicinity. It always acts in the surprise round and its initiative roll is automatically a natural 20.

Temporal Dilation (Ex) The area around a time dimensional slows the temporal passage of projectiles and spells. Creatures in this aura have concealment against ranged attacks. A time dimensional can dismiss or resume this aura as a free action.

Time Mastery (Ex) As a living embodiment of time, a time dimensional is free from the typical constraints of time's flow. It is immune to <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a>, <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a>, and <a href="spelldisplaydf0e.html?ItemName=temporal%20stasis">temporal stasis</a> and can use any actions remaining on its turn after using <a href="spelldisplay9665.html?ItemName=">dimension door</a>. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of a time dimensional casts <a href="spelldisplay9665.html?ItemName=">time stop</a>, the time dimensional can act normally as if it had cast <a href="spelldisplaye421.html?ItemName=time%20stop">time stop</a> itself for the same effective duration. As neither the time dimensional nor the caster is frozen in time with respect to the other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though neither can affect frozen creatures for the duration of the <a href="spelldisplaye421.html?ItemName=time%20stop">time stop</a>. This ability functions even if the time dimensional is flat-footed or unaware of its opponent.

Timestream Knowledge (Ex) A time dimensional shares its own knowledge from all points in its personal timeline. This knowledge grants it a +5 insight bonus to AC and all-around vision. It treats all skills as class skills, gains a +10 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks, and can attempt any Knowledge check untrained.

Description

When an event or individual threatens the nature of causality or the flow of time, a portion of the Dimension of Time breaks away from the dimension's substance to act as a correcting agent. These beings do not name themselves, but they are called time dimensionals by extraplanar scholars. Time dimensionals travel across the Great Beyond to confront and neutralize threats to the timestream. In some cases, this involves the removal of a disruptive individual or item, while in other cases it simply means delaying events long enough for the flow of time to correct itself. In the event of egregious disruptions, several time dimensionals may work together in perfect synchronicity to preserve the timestream.

The very existence of time dimensionals can disrupt the flow of normal time, so the Dimension of Time dispatches a time dimensional for only the exact duration required; furthermore, a time dimensional uses only the minimum amount of force necessary to fulfill its duties. As the exact nature of time is fickle and never completely known, those who devote their lives to the study of time are unsure as to which events trigger a time dimensional's appearance and which do not. Time dimensionals have appeared during seemingly mundane events, such as the report of a dozen time dimensionals appearing to a group of miners in Brevoy in the summer of 4284 ar. More confounding are events that appear to be an obvious call to time dimensionals, such as the appearance of the legendary Scepter of Ages, but that the dimensionals seem to ignore.

A time dimensional can manipulate the flow of time as it affects nearby matter, with effects such as locking other creatures out of time's progression or aging an item so quickly it is effectively disintegrated. It has even greater control over its own temporal positioning, allowing it to move quickly around a battlefield and obtain comprehensive knowledge of where its enemies will strike. There are reports of exceptionally rare time dimensionals with greater abilities'such as the ability to erase a creature from time entirely-though the Dimension of Time dispatches such dimensionals only to deal with the most calamitous of situations.

A time dimensional typically stands at 12 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds.

Ecology

As time dimensionals are incredibly rare creatures, much of the information about them is no more than speculation. Many conflate time dimensionals with elementals, but the nature of a time dimensional is very different. Elementals are formed from the raw matter serving as the principal building blocks of the Elemental Planes (although this matter exists throughout the Material Plane and, indeed, across the Great Beyond). A time dimensional, however, is a living portion of the Dimension of Time itself, which implies a measure of inherent sapience in that plane that the Elemental Planes lack.

A time dimensional has a nearly perfect knowledge of its own past and future, obtained by its constant connection to the Dimension of Time. Whether this connection means that a time dimensional is an extension of that demiplane, like the arm of a creature, or merely in constant mental communion with it, as if part of a hive mind, remains a subject of conjecture.

Time dimensionals are too powerful for most mortal magic to conjure, and their true names were erased from mortal knowledge in some impossibly ancient time. A <a href="spelldisplay756d.html?ItemName=gate">gate</a> spell could, in theory, beckon one of these creatures to serve, but even then the act of drawing a time dimensional out of the demiplane of Time might be enough to pull more of their kind to investigate- and likely punish-the conjurer. Those who persist in attempting to summon or bind time dimensionals often earn their ire, or else draw the attention of dangerous creatures such as <a href="monsterdisplay48b5.html?ItemName=Hound%20of%20Tindalos">hounds of Tindalos</a>.

Habitat and Society

As time dimensionals exist only at the will of the Dimension of Time, they have no definite society and do not congregate in groups outside of the Dimension of Time unless dispatched on a specific mission. Whether these creatures have formed a society of their own in the Dimension of Time is unknown, as that plane is nearly impossible to access or study.

Some speculate that there is, in fact, only a single time dimensional, and appearances of multiple ones arise from sightings of the same creature crossing and recrossing its own temporal path, meeting later or earlier incarnations of itself. In this theory, the Dimension of Time created the first and only time dimensional at the birth of time and dispatches the same one to deal with all temporal disruptions, and therefore rumors of time dimensionals with more powerful abilities are sightings of an older or advanced version of the same creature. Too much research into this model appears to be dangerous, however, as chronomancers and temporal scholars who investigate the most advanced time dimensionals often disappear entirely. The esoteric calculations these scholars leave behind hint that, after a certain point, the single time dimensional becomes so powerful that it breaks free of the Dimension of Time and pursues its own independent agenda, with indescribably catastrophic results for the multiverse.
