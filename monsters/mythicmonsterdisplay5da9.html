Special Abilities

Detect Thoughts (Su) A rakshasa can detect thoughts as the spell (CL 18th). It can suppress or resume this ability as a free action. When a rakshasa uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent 3 rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount of information possible. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 20 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Modify Memory (Sp) A mythic rakshasa can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to modify the memory of a creature whose mind it is reading, as the modify memory spell (CL 18th). The creature can resist with a successful DC 20 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Telepathic Dodge (Su) A mythic rakshasa gains an insight bonus to its AC against creatures whose minds it can read. It doesn't need to use its detect thoughts ability to gain this bonus. The rakshasa doesn't gain this bonus against creatures that are mindless or whose minds can't be read (such as from a mind blank spell).

Description

A mythic rakshasa is a natural mind reader and uses its abilities to tempt great heroes into failure and ruin-all toward to ultimate goal of seeding an entire civilization's destruction.
