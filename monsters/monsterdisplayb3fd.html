Wooden Protector - Monsters







Wooden Protector

Except for its head, this humanoid-shaped creature is composed entirely of twisting wooden vines, which thicken at its lower half to give it the appearance of wearing robes. Its head looks like a wooden full mask in the rough shape of an owl's face, with actual owl feathers rising like a crown. The creature wields a thick staff or long club made of twisting vines. Both a crystal at the head of its weapon and the creature's own wide eyes glow bright green.

Special Abilities

Create Weapon (Ex) A wooden protector can, as a free action, use its body to fashion any simple or martial weapon composed almost entirely of wood (such as bows, quarterstaffs, and spears). Weapons created in this way cannot be sundered or disarmed. If the weapon created requires ammunition (such as bows), the wooden protector takes 1 point of damage each time the weapon is fired. This damage can be regenerated as normal. Created weapons can be reabsorbed as a free action or used to create a new weapon.

Grasp of Wood (Su) As a standard action, a wooden protector can focus its gaze on a single target within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 17 Reflex save or be encased in a web of wooden branches. Those who fail are entangled and cannot move, but can escape with a successful DC 17 Strength or Escape Artist check. The branches last for 1d6 rounds before becoming brittle and breaking. The DC is Strength-based.

Natural Movement (Ex) A wooden protector may move through any sort of undergrowth at its normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. This ability extends to magically manipulated undergrowth such as entangle and wall of thorns.

Regeneration (Su) Fire deals lethal damage to a wooden protector.

Description

Undying guardians of forests, wooden protectors form when druids call upon nature to defend itself, when the druids' own personal power cannot hope to defend the wilds from what opposes them. As tireless defenders, wooden protectors frequently outlive their callers, but never stray far from where they were created.
