Special Abilities

Dismantling Gaze (Su) Once per round as a swift action, a yarahkut can concentrate its gaze on any item within 100 feet and damage that item. Attended items must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or lose half their hit points and gain the broken condition. Items that already possess the broken condition and fail this save are destroyed. Items that successfully save against this effect are immune to that yarahkut's dismantling gaze for 24 hours. Unattended non-magical items don't receive a saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Malfunctioning Aura (Su) A yarahkut radiates a disruptive aura that is harmful to ranged weapons within 100 feet. Mechanical projectile weapons'such as crossbows, firearms, siege weapons, and many technological weapons-have a 20% chance of not firing on each attack made within the aura's area. If a weapon in this aura has a misfire value, its misfire value increases by 2.

Wings (Ex) A yarahkut's wings are primary attacks.

Description

Yarahkuts are inevitables (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 161) tasked with preventing magic and technology throughout the cosmos from falling into the wrong hands. Their mandate is to track objects that could disrupt the development of cultures that are not yet ready to wield such power. In most cases, yarahkuts monitor the movement of advanced technologies and magical items from lost civilizations, ensuring they aren't introduced to regions where they could have a disruptive impact.

Noted for their intricate brass wings, yarahkuts have superb control of these appendages and are able to use them as effective weapons. Three identical faces surround a yarahkut's head, staring impassively in separate directions with glowing golden eyes. Of its two sets of arms, one set bears claws for combat, while the remaining set is more humanoid and is used to manipulate objects-including those items it confiscates. A yarahkut stands 11 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.

Ecology

These inevitables scour the planes for those in possession of items beyond their ability to control-or more accurately, beyond what the yarahkuts believe they can control-and ensure that such items do not remain in unsafe hands for long. Each yarahkut has jurisdiction over a specific territory and monitors its region for such trespasses, tracking any new piece of technology or major magical item that enters its assigned area. If an item is determined to be a threat, the yarahkut pursues its retrieval or destruction without reservation.

A yarahkut's distinctive wings are for more than just flight; the inevitable has remarkable control over these mechanical appendages. The wings are just as sharp and dangerous as its razorlike claws, and double as weapons in combat. The grace with which yarahkuts use their wings awes members of many primitive cultures, who often mistake these inevitables for celestials. Only those familiar with the nature of yarahkuts understand that their wings are weapons first, and a mode of transportation second.

Compared to most other types of inevitable, yarahkuts take extra care to avoid being destroyed on their missions. While all inevitables know that if they're destroyed, replacements will simply emerge from the forges of Axis to continue their work, yarahkuts understand that their destruction would extend the time that signif icantly advanced items are allowed to contaminate their assigned territories. Bereft of any form of innate teleportation or planar travel, yarahkuts are willing to retreat from combat if it means surviving in order to gather reinforcements or formulate a new plan.

Yarahkuts are supported in their task by a wide array of abilities; those who study these inevitables learn to fear their dismantling gazes in particular. Just by scrutinizing an item, a yarahkut is capable of disassembling it in a manner of moments, to the dismay of those who wield dangerous items against the inevitable. Yarahkuts also exude an aura that tampers with nearby mechanical items. This aura causes mechanical weapons such as crossbows and firearms to become misaligned and misfire, and can affect even advanced technology such as laser weapons.

Once a yarahkut has tracked its quarry, it uses its innate arcane sight to identify any threats that require disposal and unceremoniously relieves the target of these items. Once the transgressor has had its dangerous possessions removed, the yarahkut uses its mind-affecting abilities to strip relevant memories from the target. If the target has expert knowledge of technology or has been exposed to dangerous items for long periods of time'such as a gun maker in a primitive land or an engineer who built a weapon that could instantly destroy millions-the inevitable resorts to a thorough memory wipe or simple execution.

Habitat and Society

Yarahkuts are mostly solitary outsiders, each with its own "jurisdiction" consisting of a meticulously assembled base of power and network of contacts from across the planes. Whenever possible, yarahkuts attempt to stay removed from the mundane affairs of the material world, running their networks through intermediaries and sending agents to investigate dangerous items before committing to a mission themselves. Those in service to a yarahkut rarely realize the true nature of their benefactor, whose identity is disguised by the inevitable's heightened ability to understand and adapt to other cultures. After reviewing the intelligence gathered by their agents, yarahkuts begin planning their retrieval missions. They are meticulous creatures, and attempt to plan for as many contingencies as possible to ensure success.

As they lack innate means of traveling the planes, yarahkuts may seek aid in arriving at the location of this wayward technology-including help from mortal spellcasters who summon them. Some conjurers seeking to bind a yarahkut tempt it with information about dangerous or prohibited technology being used in the inevitable's jurisdiction. Most conjurers fail to realize, though, that the yarahkut often already knows of the dangerous technology, word of which likely trickled through its established network of informants long ago; the yarahkut had counted on being summoned so it could pursue the item itself.

In rare circumstances, yarahkuts form alliances with others of their kind. These alliances most often occur in response to the distribution of a large cache of volatile items across overlapping yarahkut jurisdictions, or the unearthing of dangerous artifacts with immediate repercussions for a large region.

Sometimes yarahkuts seek out other types of inevitables when the need arises. For example, a situation in which a powerful undead creature has discovered a lost army of robots may prompt an alliance of convenience with a marut. If a bargain was broken regarding powerful technology, a yarahkut might instead align with a kolyarut, while a death-marked exile from Numeria bringing stolen items to other nations might necessitate working with a zelekhut in order to track the renegade down.

Originally invented and forged in the Outer Planes by the axiomites, inevitables are living machines whose sole purpose is to seek out and destroy agents of chaos wherever they can.

During the height of the first war between law and chaos, while the Outer Planes were still forming from the raw chaos of the primal reality, inevitables were constructed by the axiomites as an unflinching army'soldiers powerful and devoted enough to march on the madness-inducing hordes of proteans who sought to unmake reality and return it all to the primal chaos they so adored. While this war has long since cooled to a simmer, and the reality of the Outer Planes is now not so easily threatened by the entropic influence of the proteans and their home plane, the defense of the axiomites' home plane remains the inevitables' primary goal. Despite the proteans' subsequent adaptation and study of how best to make themselves more resistant to the inevitables' attacks, these constructed soldiers remain imposingly effective.

Today, many inevitables-almost all of those encountered on the Material Plane-pursue a new aspect of their original mission: tracking down those who flagrantly flout the forces of law and redeeming them or, more often, eliminating the threat they present to the ordered nature of the multiverse. Matched on the side of chaos by the manipulative imentesh proteans, new inevitables awake to find themselves locked in a proxy war, knowing that losing the Material Plane to chaos would place their masters in a dangerous position.

Genderless, incorruptible, and caring nothing for power or personal advancement, inevitables are cunning and valiant shock troops in the service of law. Though they regularly interact with their creator race on their home plane, they have no society of their own, and are almost always encountered singly on other planes, each more than capable of pursuing its own mission. These individual crusades range from enforcing important or high-profile contracts and laws to forcibly correcting those mortals who would seek to cheat death. How they deal with the guilty varies according to the transgression: sometimes this means a simple geas or mark of justice to ensure that the target works to right his wrongs or never again strays from the path of law, but just as often an offense worthy of an inevitable's attention is severe enough that only immediate execution will suffice. Such decisions are not always popular-for the kindly priest who transcends mortality and the freedom fighter who battles the evil-yet-rightful king are every bit as guilty as grave-robbing necromancers and demon-worshipers-but the inevitables are always just, and few dare stand in the way of their judgment. Those inevitables who have completed a given mission often wander through whatever society they find themselves in, seeking other lawbreakers worthy of their ministrations. Brave souls with a worthy cause are always welcome to approach an inevitable and present their case, but should be wary of invoking the help of such powerful, single-minded beings-for an inevitable may not see the situation the same way they do, and though all inevitables do their best to preserve innocent life, they're not above sacrificing a few allies or innocents in an effort to bring down a greater villain.

Physically, inevitables often have humanoid forms or aspects, but their bodies appear somewhere between clockwork constructs and fine statues in the greatest classical tradition. Constructed of stone, adamantine, and even more precious materials, each inevitable is brought to sentience in the axiomites' forges already programmed with the details of its first target. Though they know that all beings outside of the lawful planes harbor chaos in their hearts, inevitables also understand that such conflicted creatures may yet be forces for law as much as for chaos, and thus overlook all but the most flagrant offenses. The most commonly recognized types of inevitables are as follows.

Arbiters: Scouts and diplomats, often assigned to wizards as familiars in the hopes of directing such individuals to the cause of law.

Kolyaruts: Cloaked and stealthy humanoid warriors who track and punish those who break contracts.

Lhaksharuts: Juggernauts who search for permanent breaches and links between planes and invasions from one dimension to another.

Maruts: Towering beings of stone, steel, and storm who bring a fitting end to those mortals who try to cheat death in attempts to live forever.

Zelekhuts: Winged, centaur-like constructs who track down those who flee just and legal punishment, returning them to their rightful judges or carrying out the sentence themselves.

Primal Inevitables

While the lhaksharuts are generally thought of as the most powerful caste of inevitable, there exist others of even greater skill and strength-these are known as the primal inevitables. These goliaths were among the first weapons of war forged by the axiomites to fight the protean menace-the methods to create more have long been lost to the axiomites, and those few primals who remain alive to this day have become legendary. None have been encountered in living memory, but the possibility of a primal's emergence is enough to give the proteans second thoughts when ideas of invading the inevitables' home plane arise.
