Candlestone Courtier

This willowy, lavender-skinned stranger looks like he is dressed for an extravagant ball, and carries himself with a dancer's grace.

Special Abilities

Fey Bargain (Su) Once per week, a Candlestone courtier can grant a limited wish or a permanent +2 inherent bonus to one ability score. In exchange, the bargainer is cursed to be carried off in its dreams each night by the courtier to a never-ending fey ball that, while pleasant as often as not, affects the dreamer as nightmare, requiring a saving throw each night (Will DC 21 negates). The DC to remove this curse is reduced by 4 if the courtier is killed, and a successful coup de grace on the courtier with a cold iron weapon automatically ends the curse. Ending the curse also ends any noninstantaneous effects of the bargain. A creature can have only one fey bargain at a time.

Spellthrust (Su) When a courtier threatens a critical hit, it can trigger a spell-like ability with a range of touch against the target. If the critical hit is confirmed, the target must save twice, using the lower result.

Description

Candlestone courtiers are emissaries of Queen Frilogarma and the Court of Ether. Venturing up from their Darklands domain, they make deals to the benefit of their queen, forge secret alliances with citizens of foreign lands, and inveigle mortals into endless revels in the inverted fey city while sapping the vitality of their victims to sate their alien appetites. Candlestone courtiers prefer to employ trickery and extortion over direct violence, but don't shy away from a fight if it is the fastest way to get what they want.
