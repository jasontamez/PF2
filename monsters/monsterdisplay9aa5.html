Xenarth - Monsters







<table class="table">
<tr>
<td>Bulette, Xenarth

This huge beast rests atop four thick legs that end in sleek, curved claws, and its body is covered in red-hued armor plates that drip with foul ichor. Its eyes glow red like hot coals, and strange veins between its plates pulse and glow like flames. Along its spine, a slender armored crest peaks at mid-back, much like the top fin of a shark.

Tactics

Before Combat Unlike their stupid cousins, xenarths possess some tactical skills. They prefer to sneak up on opponents and often trail potential victims unobserved from their underground tunnels, studying them and learning their weaknesses before ambushing them in advantageous terrain.
During Combat Xenarths are afraid of nothing and attack with reckless abandon. They revel in the act of violence and eat everything they kill, if only to vomit it forth again later in a grisly and triumphant torrent.
Morale Xenarths fight to the death.

Special Abilities

Demon Ichor (Su) A slimy red ichor coats the xenarth's armored plates. Any weapon that touches a xenarth takes 3d8 points of acid damage from the corrosive demon essence, and the weapon's hardness does not reduce this damage. A magic weapon may attempt a DC 17 Reflex save to avoid taking this damage. A creature that strikes a xenarth with an unarmed attack, unarmed strike, melee touch spell, or natural weapon takes this damage unless the attacker makes a DC 17 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.

Poison (Ex) Injury, Fortitude DC 23, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage 2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

The most feared bulette mutations are the xenarths. Also called ichor sharks, xenarths are an incredibly rare species of bulette that most believe long vanished from the world. Since the original bulettes were created with infusions of demon ichor, many have long associated them with demons despite the fact that they're simply magically created beasts. Xenarths, however, are actually demons. At the moment of the creation process when the fused animal parts were combined with demon ichor, xenarths were imbued with an excess of this essence, becoming demonic outsiders, creatures not of the Material Plane. Xenarths are covered in a slimy red ichor that burns like acid when touched and helps propel them through the soil much quicker than the bulette. Xenarths are brutal and even more frightening than their cousins. Bulettes eat to fuel an insatiable hunger-xenarths eat for the pure pleasure of destruction, and have been known to eat, regurgitate, and move on to other food.
