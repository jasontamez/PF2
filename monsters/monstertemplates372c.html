"Shadow creature" is an inherited template that can be added to any living creature, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A shadow creature retains all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1.
Alignment: Any (usually nongood).
Type: The base creature's type changes to outsider, and it gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.
Senses: As the base creature plus darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision.
Defensive Abilities: A shadow creature gains DR and resistance to cold and electricity based on its Hit Dice, as noted on the following table.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Hit Dice</td><td>Resist Cold and Electricity</td><td>DR</td></tr> <tr><td>1-4</td><td>5</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>5-10</td><td>10</td><td>5/magic</td></tr> <tr><td>11+</td><td>15</td><td>10/magic</td></tr></table>
Shadow Blend (Su): In any illumination other than bright light, a shadow creature blends into the shadows, giving it concealment (20% miss chance). A shadow creature can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A shadow creature gains spell resistance equal to the base creature's CR + 6.
