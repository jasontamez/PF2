A skilled artificer can revitalize a ruined construct by jury-rigging the pieces left intact. The patchwork nature of a recycled construct renders it fragile and leaves key circuitry exposed. reducing its bonus hit points by 5.

"Recycled construct" is an acquired template that can be added to a construct with 3 or more Hit Dice made predominantly of solid material. A recycled construct uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.



Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR - 1.

Defensive Abilities: Reduce any damage reduction or hardness by 5. Replace any immunity to magic with spell resistance equal to the base creature's CR + 11. Any exceptions to the base creature's immunity to magic automatically bypass the recycled construct's spell resistance and function as described for the base creature.

Weaknesses: A recycled construct gains the following weakness.

Malfunction (Ex): A recycled construct that takes precision damage or extra damage from a critical hit becomes staggered for 1 round and immediately triggers a malfunction. To determine the nature of this malfunction, roll 1d10 and consult the table on page 52 (CL = the base creature's HD; save DC = 10 + the base creature's HD). A creature can use a move action to attempt a special Disable Device check before dealing precision damage to a recycled construct (DC = 20 + the base creature's HD). On a success, the attacking creature can roll twice and choose the malfunction result.

Attacks: If the base creature has more than one natural attack, remove one natural attack. The creator can replace the lost attack with a light, one-handed, or ranged weapon of at least masterwork quality and a size appropriate for the base creature.


Construction

A recycled construct is built from the remains of the base creature. When destroyed, the base creature must not have taken damage exceeding its total hit points plus 20; otherwise the remnants were too badly damaged to be useful. Additionally, recycling the construct requires replacement parts worth half the value of the base creature's body. Construction requirements are identical to the base creature, except the DC of any relevant skill checks is reduced by 5 and the cost is reduced by half.


Recycling Robots

In order to create a recycled robot or similar construct, a crafter must have the <a href="featdisplay2071.html?ItemName=Craft%20Construct">Craft Construct</a> feat and the <a href="featdisplay7f89.html?ItemName=Technologist">Technologist</a> feat. Creating a recycled robot requires the remains of other complex constructs, such as robots or clockworks, collectively worth 50,000 gp or more. Crafting a Medium or smaller recycled robot requires the remains of two Medium complex constructs; a Large robot requires the remains of four Medium constructs, and so on. Crafting a recycled robot requires 1 week per set of Medium complex construct remains required for construction.

While creating a recycled robot, the crafter must attempt one Knowledge (engineering) check per Medium construct remains used in construction (DC = 20 + the base creature's CR). For each failed check, the recycled robot gains a glitch. To determine the nature of this glitch, roll 1d6 and consult the table  below. Multiple glitches of the same type stack. If the crafter fails more than half of the required Knowledge (engineering) checks, he fails to recycle the construct and ruins the materials.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>d6</td><td>Glitch</td></tr> <tr><td>1</td><td>Reduce any bonus hp the base construct received by 5 (minimum 0).</td></tr> <tr><td>2</td><td>Reduce all movement speeds by 5 feet. If the recycled construct's burrow, fly, or swim speed is reduced to 0, it loses that movement option. Land speed can be reduced to a minimum of 5 feet.</td></tr> <tr><td>3</td><td>Reduce base attack bonus by 1 (minimum +0).</td></tr> <tr><td>4</td><td>Reduce any natural armor bonus by 1 (minimum +0).</td></tr> <tr><td>5</td><td>The recycled robot takes a -1 penalty on all skill checks.</td></tr> <tr><td>6</td><td>The recycled robot has a 5% chance each round of acting erratically, as if confused.</td></tr> </table>
