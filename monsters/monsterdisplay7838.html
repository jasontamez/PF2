Special Abilities

Death Strike (Su) A grim reaper automatically confirms any critical hit. A creature damaged by a critical hit from a grim reaper must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude saving throw or be instantly killed. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Death's Grace (Su) The dark power stolen from countless souls protects a grim reaper, granting it a profane bonus on all saving throws and to AC equal to its Charisma modifier.
Final Death (Su) A creature killed by a grim reaper can't be brought back to life by any means short of divine intervention.
Misfortune Aura (Su) When a living creature attempts an ability check, attack roll, caster level check, skill check, or saving throw within 20 feet of a grim reaper, it must roll two d20s and take the lowest roll before applying any modifiers.
Status Sight (Su) When a grim reaper gazes on a creature, it can see that creature's emotion aura and that creature's current health and overall well-being. This acts as the status spell, as well as the emotion aura aspect of the analyze aura spell.

Description

As silent as the grave and as inevitable as time, grim reapers are more akin to forces of nature than individual beings, being nothing less than personifications of grim, violent death.

Unlike their lesser kin, grim reapers never work together or with other creatures, save for select ancient dragons and dragon-like undead that sometimes serve these dreaded soul hunters as steeds. This lack of cooperation has led some to speculate that there is only one grim reaper who plagues the multiverse. Others claim that least nine of these creatures stalk the worlds and planes, culling the living as inexplicable servants of true entropy. According to the teaching of some death cults, the final goal of a grim reaper is to end the entire cycle of life and death and to serve as a silent lord of an empty universe.

Grim reapers are so feared that even most outsiders give them a wide berth. This suits the reapers well, as that means less interference with the harvest of doomed souls. A grim reaper stands approximately 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 40 pounds.
