Description

Vukodlaks spawn from the malignant
spirits of powerful, intelligent, wolf like
creatures such as worgs, winter wolves,
or werewolves. Often they arise from such
creatures that-through desperation
or depravity-fed on undead f lesh
or drank the blood of a vampiric
creature. Their blackened souls
arise after death, twisting their
bodies into monstrous shapes.
Like vampires, vukodlaks share
an insatiable thirst for blood.

Vukodlaks measure 8 feet long
and 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and
they weigh 1,000 pounds. A vukodlak typically walks on
all fours, and from a distance can easily be mistaken for
a large, shaggy horse. However, it has a distinct wolf like
muzzle filled with sharp canine teeth, as well as other
wolfish features. Vukodlaks possess monstrous strength,
making them ideal mounts for powerful undead masters
or other evil creatures. While serving as mounts, they keep
to all fours, and might easily be mistaken for worgs or
great fanged horses. Masters seeking to control vukodlaks
find the most success relying on fear and intimidation,
as well as providing a constant source of blood for the
creature to feed upon. Vukodlaks share a natural kinship
with vampires and often serve them willingly.

Vukodlaks hunger for blood, gorging themselves rather
than saving victims to feed on later. When feeding, they can
prove difficult to command. Riders who are not careful in
their attempts to restrain a hungry vukodlak risk having
their mount turn on them. While vukodlaks can go days
without feeding, they gradually become weaker if they do
not feed daily, and have difficulty operating on anything
other than pure instinct. Though intelligent, vukodlaks
rarely think or plan ahead, instead focusing on feeding or
obeying their masters' commands.

Vukodlaks without masters often form small packs.
These packs annihilate all life in entire areas, overfeeding
until destroyed or forced to move on. Vukodlaks hate
sunlight and hunt only at night, making their lairs in
deep caves or ruins. They don't care for treasure; anything
of worth found in a vukodlak lair is simply something its
latest victim was carrying that the beast couldn't eat.

Although vukodlaks don't appear undead at first
glance, any creature that wounds one or
finds a vukodlak corpse can tell they're
not living creatures-their bodies
being largely hollow, filled with the
rotten, stinking remains of organs
that ceased functioning long ago.
