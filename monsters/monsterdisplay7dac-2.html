Riftcreeper - Monsters







Riftcreeper

This slithering mass of bubbling red ooze extrudes a nest of long,
thin tendrils, as if tasting the air in search of prey.

Special Abilities

Adaptive Defenses (Su) After being damaged by any
magical effect that deals cold, electricity, fire, or
sonic damage, a riftcreeper's body instantly adapts
to become immune to that form of energy. A
riftcreeper can adapt to only one of those four types
of energy at a time-if it adapts to a new energy
type, it loses its immunity to the previous type.
Otherwise, the immunity lasts for 1 hour.

Gelatinous Surge (Ex) Once per minute as a standard
action, a riftcreeper can extrude a protoplasmic
tendril of ooze to attach to any vertical surface
within 120 feet. It can then transfer its entire
bulk along that tendril as part of that standard action
to change its location to the surface to which it is now
attached. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of
opportunity. Any creatures along its line of travel are
subjected to a bull rush attempt.

Strands (Ex) A riftcreeper can extend up to six thin, sticky
strands from its body at a time as a standard action,
launching them to a maximum range of 120 feet. These
attacks resolve as ranged touch attacks. On a hit, a strand
deals 2d6 points of acid damage to its target and attaches to
the creature. These strands are quite strong, but any amount
of slashing damage severs them (a strand has AC 25). As
long as a strand remains attached to a target, that creature
takes an additional 2d6 points of acid damage at the start of
its turn. A riftcreeper can automatically absorb the strands
into its body if it uses its gelatinous surge ability (in doing
so, it releases any attached creatures).

Description

Heaving masses of unnatural protoplasm known as
riftcreepers prowl the Abyss's shattered canyons. Despite
their name, these intelligent, malevolent oozes are quite
agile and swift, slithering up and down canyon walls and
swimming through even the foulest water. Although smart
enough to understand Abyssal, riftcreepers have little
interest in listening to the babbling of the sacks of meat
that will soon be their food.
