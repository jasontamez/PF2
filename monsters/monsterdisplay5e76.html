Description

Boggard priest-kings are the undisputed lords of their tribes, interpreting the wills of their dark patron deities (wills that are often suspiciously similar to what the priest-kings themselves desire). Grotesquely large, a boggard priest-king is usually the tribe's most capable combatant, and acts as a champion when needed.
