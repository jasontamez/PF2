While there are rules in Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures for when a creature is possessed and totally controlled by a specific spell, sometimes a creature is possessed by a vague entity (hereafter called a spirit) that acts as a second personality within the creature's mind, sharing control and providing the creature some symbiotic benefits.

Quick Rules: +2 on rolls based on Cha; +4 on Will saves; after failing a save against a mind-affecting effect, reroll the save, but the spirit takes control if the second save succeeds; always acts on the surprise round.

Rebuild Rules: Defensive Abilities +4 on Will saves; after failing a save against a mind-affecting effect, reroll the save, but the spirit takes control if the second save succeeds; Special Qualities always acts on the surprise round; Ability Scores +4 Cha.
