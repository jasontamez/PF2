Description

Arising from the armored remains of towering humanoids, these suits are particularly fearsome, though slower than guardian phantom armors.

Creating Phantom Armors

Phantom armors are created using the spell create undead. Creating a phantom armor requires a corpse wearing a suit of heavy armor. The corpse is destroyed in the phantom armor's creation. A magic-user must be at least caster level 12th to create a guardian phantom armor and at least caster level 15th to create a giant phantom armor.

Raised from the corpses of knights and soldiers slain by treachery rather than battle or conflicts considered crimes even in the heat of war, phantom armors appear as suits of animate armor, walking or floating of their own accord. Most phantom armors haunt the halls and blasted battlef ields where they were slain, seeking revenge against their murderers or, should that prove impossible, confronting any living creature that might give them the opportunity to do battle once more. Dastardly necromancers have also discovered the process for binding violent spirits to suits of armor, giving rise to eerie servants that combine endless patience with cold brutality.

Phantom armors come in many shapes and sizes; some appear to be nothing more than animate helms while others resemble armored giants.


Creating Phantom Armor

Phantom armors of varying types can be created using the spell create undead, as detailed below. In addition to requiring a corpse for it to be cast upon, the spell requires that body must be wearing a suit of heavy armor. The corpse dissolves into the armor at the conclusion of the spell's casting.
