Special Abilities

Change Shape (Su) A
reptoid can assume
the appearance of a specific
single Medium humanoid. The reptoid
always takes this specific form when it uses
this ability. The reptoid gains a +10 racial
bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that
type of humanoid. This ability otherwise
functions as alter self, except the reptoid
does not adjust its ability scores. A reptoid can
select a new humanoid form by spending 1 week
preparing itself for the change, but can then no
longer assume its previous humanoid form.

Mental Potency (Ex) A reptoid's mental effects
can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of
creatures than normal. Both the Hit Die limit and the total
number of Hit Dice affected by each enchantment or illusion
spell it casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells
it casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the
number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell
that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a
spell that targets only one creature would not be). This ability
stacks with the mesmerist's ability of the same name.

Description

Reptoids are bipedal reptiles from another planet, or
perhaps even another plane-they refuse to reveal their
origins to humanoids, even under duress. Disguised as
members of others races, the reptoids seek positions of
power in order to secretly prepare for an invasion from
their homeworld. Even those who are aware of reptoids in
their midst can never be truly sure who is real and who is
an alien, as these creatures are often adept at enchantment
and psychic magic, which they use to cover the tracks of
their deceptions and to ensure the complacency or even
collusion of their soon-to-be thralls.
