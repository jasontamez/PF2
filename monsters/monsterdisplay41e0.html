Special Abilities

Rapid Fire (Su) As a full-round action, a forsaken arbalester can use its repeating heavy crossbow to make a total of three attacks using its full base attack bonus on each attack. At any time, the arbalester can reload its crossbow case with new bolts as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Description

These soldiers were once specialists who operated a variety of ranged weapons, including ancient Jistkan siege weapons. The unholy power of the forsaken legion allows these arbalesters to fire ghostly bolts supernaturally quickly without sacrificing accuracy.
