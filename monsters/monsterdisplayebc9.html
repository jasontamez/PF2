Special Abilities

Aura Transparency (Ex) A reborn samsaran has difficulty hiding his psychic signatures. The DC of any skill check made to read his aura decreases by 5, and the check takes one-tenth as long as normal to perform.

Psychic Learning (Su) When a reborn samsaran expends psychic energy to cast psychic reading to identify a humanoid's class, he temporarily treats two of the target's class skills as if they were class skills for him. He can use these skills untrained and gains a +2 insight bonus on such checks. These benefits last for 24 hours or until the reborn samsaran spends psychic energy to cast psychic reading again.

Description

Sometimes a samsaran perishes under especially dramatic emotional circumstances, causing its soul to wander the Ethereal Plane before finally reincarnating. This spirit journey frays the samsaran's connection to his past lives but strengthens his ability to read others' pasts and present.
