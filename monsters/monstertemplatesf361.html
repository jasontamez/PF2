Usable with Summons Yes

Creatures who have been "blessed" with the demon lord Kostchtchie's attention may acquire this template, which leaves them hunched and knotted with corded muscles and awkwardly formed limbs. Though slower and clumsier than their fellows, gnarled creatures are much stronger and hardier and have thick, horny skin. "Gnarled" is an acquired template that can be applied to any creature of the animal, dragon, fey, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, outsider, undead, or vermin type.
