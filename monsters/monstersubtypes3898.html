Sahkils are neutral evil outsiders native to the Ethereal Plane. They have the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision. </li><li>Immunity to death effects, disease, fear effects, and poison. </li><li>Resistance to cold 10, electricity 10, and sonic 10. </li><li>Most sahkils are resistant to magic. Such a sahkil has SR equal to 11 + its CR. </li><li>Except where otherwise noted, sahkils speak Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal. </li><li>Telepathy. </li><li>Easy to Call (Ex): Sahkils count as having 4 fewer Hit Dice (minimum 2) for purposes of spells or effects that call outsiders, such as <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a>. However, they receive a racial bonus equal to 1/2 their Hit Dice on Charisma checks to break free of <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a> spells and similar effects, and their spell resistance counts as if it were 5 higher for the purpose of breaking free of <a href="spelldisplay1680.html?ItemName=planar%20binding">planar binding</a> spells and similar effects. </li><li>Emotional Focus (Ex): Whenever a sahkil casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability or effect with the emotion or fear descriptors that allows a save, the DC is increased by 2. </li><li>Look of Fear (Su): All sahkils have a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet (though when a sahkil is on the Ethereal Plane, it functions against creatures on the Material Plane that can see ethereal creatures), and can be negated by a Will save- the exact effects caused by a particular sahkil's look of fear depend on the type of sahkil. All sahkils are immune to their own look of fear and that of other sahkils. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes the +2 bonus from the sahkil's emotional focus ability. </li><li>Skip Between (Su): Many sahkils can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane as a move action. This ability is otherwise identical to <a href="spelldisplayae66.html?ItemName=ethereal%20jaunt">ethereal jaunt</a> (CL 15th). </li><li>Spirit Touch (Ex): A sahkil's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> weapon special ability.</li></ul>
