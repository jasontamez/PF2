Special Abilities

Blood Squirt (Ex) Once per day as a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a horned lizard can squirt a 5-foot-long stream of blood from the corners of its eyes. The animal's blood contains noxious chemicals, and a creature hit by the blood must succeed at a DC 9 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Camouflage (Ex) While in desert terrain, a horned lizard can use the Stealth skill to hide even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.

Puff Up (Ex) When taking the total defense action, a horned lizard puffs up its body, appearing larger and more horned and gaining an additional +4 bonus to CMD against grapple attempts.

Description

Despite their sluggish, toad-like appearance, these creatures are reptiles with dry, spiny skin adapted to prevent water loss in their native desert environment. They are typically found sunning themselves on rocks during all but the hottest parts of the day, retreating beneath the shade of ridges or rocks when the sun is directly overhead. Their main method of defense is to avoid detection, but when their desert coloration fails to fool predators, they attempt to flee or use their other defensive methods, such as their unique ability to rupture blood vessels in their eyes so they can spray noxious blood at approaching predators. Due to their fierce defensive displays, horned lizards are often thought to be overly aggressive, though people who keep them as pets or familiars know that they can be affectionate creatures.
