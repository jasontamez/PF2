Long-Lived (Ex) Yaddithians live for thousands of years; they gain no benefit or penalty from aging and are immune to magical aging effects.

Description

Yaddithians are an ancient race of scholarly starfarers. Bholes (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 18) consumed their home planet long ago; the survivors fled to other worlds across the universe. It is rare to find a yaddithian less powerful than the wizard above
