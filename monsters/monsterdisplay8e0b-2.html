Description

Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving, allowing them to surprise their foes. Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups called "wings" for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons-gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night.

The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble that region's architectural styles. The changes a gargoyle's appearance undergoes are slow and subtle, but over the course of years, it can shift radically.

One unusual variant of gargoyle dwells not amid buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths-they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed of 60 feet (but are useless for actual flight). Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle.

Sinister hunters of living stone, gargoyles perch high on the rooftops of towns and cities, appearing for all the world like harmless stone sculptures, carved in the likeness of demons, devils, or other hideous humanoid creatures. As still as statues, they patiently wait through the daylight hours, watching the city come to life and hungrily eyeing the unwitting passersby below. When dusk falls, the statues come alive and fly into the night sky, silently soaring above the darkened streets on stony wings looking for prey, snatching up unsuspecting walkers, never to be seen again.


Variant Gargoyles

In addition to the aquatic kapoacinth, several other varieties of gargoyle exist that have adapted to their surroundings.

Arctic Gargoyle: In cold, northern climes, some gargoyles have adapted to hunt the icy glaciers and snowfields. The skin of arctic gargoyles looks like weathered rock with scattered white patches that helps them hide among the snowy mountains. They gain a +6 racial modifier on Stealth checks made in stony or snowy environs and have cold resistance 5. (CR +0)

Forest Gargoyle: These strange gargoyles prefer the tall trees of forests and jungles to the rocky spires of mountains. Their skin has the appearance of bark, granting them a +6 racial modifier on Stealth checks in wooded areas (this replaces the normal gargoyle's modifier in stony areas). Forest gargoyles lose the normal gargoyle's freeze ability, but gain the following spell-like ability: 3/day-<a href="spelldisplay5e58.html?ItemName=warp%20wood">warp wood</a>. (CR +0)

Gemstone Gargoyle: Rarely, an individual gargoyle is born with skin with the luster and appearance of a valuable gemstone. Amethyst, opal, sapphire, and topaz are most common, but legends also tell of diamond, emerald, and ruby gargoyles. Gemstone gargoyles are usually smarter and stronger than other gargoyles, and often rise to positions of leadership within tribes or wings. Gemstone gargoyles have the advanced creature template and usually have class levels, typically in barbarian or fighter. They have DR 10/adamantine (instead of the normal gargoyle DR), SR 14, and resistance 10 to acid, cold, electricity, or fire. (CR +1 plus advanced creature template and class levels)

Obsidian Gargoyle: Creatures at home in the searing heat of volcanoes and lava fields, obsidian gargoyles have the dark, glassy appearance of polished obsidian. The razor-sharp edges of their claws and teeth increase the damage of their natural attacks by one step, and anyone attacking an obsidian gargoyle with unarmed or natural attacks takes 1d4 points of damage from the gargoyle's jagged glass spikes. Obsidian gargoyles also have fire resistance 10. (CR +0)

Sandstone Gargoyle: Sandstone gargoyles inhabit wide beaches and deserts, or anywhere with a large amount of sand or loose dirt. They have a rough, granulated appearance, and small bits of debris constantly fall from their bodies. Sandstone gargoyles have a burrow speed of 10 feet, though only through sand or loose soil. They can also bury themselves in sand, erupting forth to attack with surprise. This counts as a charge, except the gargoyle can only move its speed (not twice its speed). (CR +0)

Waterspout Gargoyle: These creatures have adapted to life in a magical city, and may be the descendents of a wizard's team of modified gargoyle guards and spies. They can cling to buildings with ease and have a climb speed of 20 feet. Waterspout gargoyles have a breath weapon in the form of a stream of high-velocity water 20 feet long and 1 foot wide which expels about 30 gallons of water. The force of this geyser deals 1d4 points of damage to a single target and the gargoyle can use this ability to trip or bull rush the target as a free action (if the attempt fails, the gargoyle cannot be tripped or bull rushed in return). The breath weapon is usable every 1d4 rounds and is a supernatural ability. In addition, particularly daring gargoyles can reduce their stream to a trickle in order to pass themselves off as ornamental fountains. (CR +0)
