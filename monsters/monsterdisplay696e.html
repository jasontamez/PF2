Wood - Monsters







Idol, Wood

Polished stones form the soulless eyes of this small yet bizarrely crafted wooden effigy. Shaped into the form of some inscrutable deity or spirit, its exotically carved features contort in a primeval scowl.

Special Abilities

Incombustible Aura (Su) All creatures within 30 feet of a wood idol gain fire resistance 10. This effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the wood idol's aura. Any time a being makes use of this resistance to any degree, the wood idol takes 1 point of normal damage, appearing more and more charred as it takes damage. This ability ceases to function should a wood idol have only 1 hit point and does not reactivate until it regains hit points.

Primeval Curse (Su) Once per day, a wood idol can force a creature within 15 feet to make a DC 12 Will save or be cursed. This curse functions similarly to the spell bestow curse, except that it can only either decrease an ability score by -4 or cause a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. In addition, while affected, the skin of the target takes on a rough, wooden appearance. A wood idol's curse can only affect one creature at a time, and should it curse another creature, the first target is no longer affected. This effect can be removed by remove curse or by eating a goodberry. The save DC is Charisma based.

Regeneration (Ex) A wood idol's regeneration only functions while it is standing on wood, grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol.

Description

Among rare druidic circles, tribes of the deep jungle, and the mysterious people of the distant west, wood idols frequently serve as representations of powerful spirits of the wilds, who these nature devotees propitiate with sacrifices. The superstitions of strange shamans hold that spirits possess the idols when the sacrifices are made, consuming the offering before returning from whence they came. Yet those who would offend these forces must beware, as they manipulate eldritch powers of the world and might curse one's every effort. While many question the truths of such beliefs, few who impugn the might of such spirits survive the ire of their shaman-creators' devout congregations.

The trappings of strange cultures and jealous mystics, isolated natives and sinister beliefs, idols symbolize the might of enigmatic and often bloody faiths. As the focus of cultish tribes and mysterious religions, crude icons occasionally come to express a measure of true power, transforming religious ardor offered through centuries of worship or the magic of inscrutable priests into not just supernatural properties, but actual life. Such idols thus become manifestations of self-fulfilling beliefs, servants to zealots, and miniature gods to the blindly devout.

While the abilities of an idol are tied intrinsically to the magic and materials from which it is made, all idols constantly radiate moderate magical auras and possess the following special abilities:

Inanimate (Ex) An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.'suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.

Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).

Skills In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.
