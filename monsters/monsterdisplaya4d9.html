Special Abilities

Telekinetic Invisibility (Ex) An aether elemental's body bends light and dampens sound waves. This works as the <a href="kineticisttalentsdisplay1e4b.html?ItemName=Telekinetic%20Invisibility">kineticist utility wild talent telekinetic invisibility</a>, except that it is constant and doesn't end when the elemental attacks. As this ability is inherent, it is not subject to effects such as <a href="spelldisplayf08f.html?ItemName=invisibility%20purge">invisibility purge</a>.

Telekinetic Throw (Ex) An aether elemental can fling a creature or object (with a maximum range of 480 feet). A creature receives a Fortitude save to avoid being thrown (the save DC is Constitution-based). The telekinetic throw deals the listed damage to both the thrown creature or object and the target. The aether elemental can throw a creature or object that weighs at most 50 pounds per Hit Die the elemental possesses.

Telekinetic Deflection (Su) An aether elemental gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Constitution modifier.

Telekinetic Maneuver (Su) An aether elemental can attempt a ranged combat maneuver check, as per <a href="spelldisplay83a8.html?ItemName=telekinesis">telekinesis</a>, with a CMB equal to its Hit Dice + its Dexterity modifier.
