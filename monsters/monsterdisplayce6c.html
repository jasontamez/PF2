Poppet Augmentations

The following abilities can be added to a poppet at the time of creation or added later to a poppet under the crafter's control. Each augmentation is listed with the additional price to a buyer, as well as the additional requirements that a crafter must meet to produce the augmentation (in addition to the Craft Construct or Craft Poppet feat), followed by the additional cost to the crafter.
