Tactics

Before Combat The warrior vampire uses her oil of keen edge on her katana and applies a dose of her racial poison to it.
During Combat The warrior vampire uses her scabbard of vigor to grant her katana a +3 enhancement bonus for 3 rounds. Once that expires, or if her katana attacks are ineffective, she resorts to natural attacks, grappling, and her drain chi ability.

Special Abilities

Drain Chi (Su) Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains "chi," or life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by succeeding at a DC 17 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.

Poison (Ex) Vishkanya Venom: Weapon-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.

Prayer Scroll (Su) The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants immunity to any effects generated by spell-completion or spelltrigger magic items, such as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if she had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi's prayer scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322), which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard action), the vampire also loses her fast healing ability. A jiangshi can create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.

Toxic (Ex) Four times per day as a swift action, a vishkanya can envenom a weapon that she wields with her toxic saliva or blood.

Description

When this vishkanya was alive, she pursued the path of the samurai, but wasn't allowed to join their honorable ranks. Her restless spirit remained trapped in her flesh after death, and eventually she animated her own rotting body and sought out those who had wronged her.
