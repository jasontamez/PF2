Spellscar Fext

This undead horror's upper body is twisted and malformed, and its hands end in tangles of blunt, electric-blue tendrils.

Special Abilities

Deadly Slam (Ex) A Spellscar fext threatens a critical hit with its slam attack on rolls of 18-20.

Dispelling Critical (Su) Whenever a Spellscar fext successfully scores a critical hit with its slam attack, the creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by the targeted dispel version of a dispel magic spell (caster level 10th). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Ravage Magic (Su) Any targeted spell or spell-like ability that fails to penetrate a Spellscar fext's spell resistance is absorbed by the fext and warped into a form of primal magic. A Spellscar fext can twist only a number of spell levels per round equal to its Charisma modifier (4 for most Spellscar fexts); any spells in excess of this limit automatically bypass a Spellscar fext's spell resistance and don't trigger this ability. Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a spell that has been affected by a Spellscar fext's ravage magic ability. Alternatively, a Spellscar mutant may use any of the sample primal magic events found on page 13 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic in place of the following effects, replacing the CR of such effects with the CR of the Spellscar fext.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>d%</td><td>Effect</td></tr> <tr><td>01-40</td><td>The spell has no effect.</td></tr> <tr><td>41-70</td><td>The Spellscar fext emits a burst of negative energy, dealing a number of points of negative energy damage equal to 1d6 x the spell level of the triggering spell to all creatures in a 30-footradius burst.</td></tr> <tr><td>71-90</td><td>The Spellscar fext instantly switches places with the spellcaster that targeted the fext with the triggering spell as though by dimension door.</td></tr> <tr><td>91-100</td><td>The spell is immediately turned back on its caster via spell turning.</td></tr></table>
Vulnerable to Glass (Ex) A Spellscar fext's hide is particularly vulnerable to the penetrations of glass and glass-based weapons. Spellscar fexts take 150% as much damage as normal from glass-headed piercing or slashing weapons.

Description

The abominable undead known as Spellscar fexts are formed by wayward spellcasters who perish in the sprawling badlands of the Mana Wastes, their bodies and souls perverted by the unpredictable primal energies that surge throughout the Spellscar Desert. The average Spellscar fext stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.

The unnatural and corruptive transformations a fallen victim undergoes as it turns into a Spellscar fext render its body hard and especially resilient to the magical energies of most spellcasters. In a peculiar twist, the same corruptive energy that causes spells to bounce off of Spellscar fexts' hides also strangely renders them susceptible to glass and glass-based weapons. Talented gunsmiths from Alkenstar have managed to craft glass bullets for rif le-wielding adventurers and monster hunters for the purpose of eradicating Spellscar fexts.
