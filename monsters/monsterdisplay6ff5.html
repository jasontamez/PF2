Giant Gecko - Monsters







Lizard, Giant Gecko

An oversized lizard the size of a horse scans the area, its bulging eyes darting this way and that, completely independent of one another. Every few moments a long pink tongue snaps from its wide mouth, either to snatch up some unseen insect or moisten an eye.

Special Abilities

Expert Climber (Ex) The unique physiology of gecko feet allow geckos to climb any surface, no matter how slick or sheer. In effect, giant geckos are treated as constantly being under a natural version of the spell spider climb. This ability also provides them with an additional +8 bonus on Climb check, which stacks with their racial bonus.

Description

Oversized lizards, giant geckos rarely threaten creatures larger than dogs or halflings. Known for their relative intelligence, some savage humanoids employ them as watchdogs or sometimes even mounts.
