Special Abilities

Anathematize (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a curse devil can temporarily drop its natural invisibility to reveal its true, horrifying form. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become cursed as bestow curse; additionally, all creatures in the area must succeed at a second DC 16 Will save or have their memories of the event stripped as if by modify memory. The curse devil can resume its invisibility at the end of its turn as a free action. Whether or not the saves are successful, an affected creature is immune to that curse devil's anathematize ability for 24 hours. If its natural invisibility is negated by other methods, the curse devil can't use this ability. Those who can see invisible creatures are immune to this effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

Broken Curses (Ex) When a curse devil dies, any lingering curses or harmful effects caused by the devil are undone as if by a miracle spell.

Infernal Bond (Ex) When a curse devil is created by a lesser or greater devil, its creator forges a magical link between the curse devil and a mortal signed to-or implicated in-an infernal contract, such as a mortal who sold her soul to a devil or the first-born child of a mortal who was promised in an infernal bargain). Thereafter, the curse devil can always find the specified mortal as though guided by a locate creature spell with no maximum range. The specified mortal takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against the curse devil's anathematize ability and its spell-like abilities.

Description

Curse devils, or phiams, are constructs of Hell that exist outside the infernal hierarchy. They are forged by more powerful devils to hunt down mortals whose souls belong to Hell. When folk speak of "family curses" or "damned fates," a curse devil is often pulling strings.

A curse devil is 4 feet tall and weighs 80 pounds.

Masters of corruption and despoilers of purity, devils seek to destroy all things good and drag mortal souls back with them to the depths of Hell.

As the most numerous fiendish occupants of Hell, the various forms of devils are well catalogued by diabolists. Most are known by two names: an evocative title given to the fiends by commoners and folklore, and an obscure, ancient designation spoken by the servants of Hell and those who would seek to deal with the damned.

Born from the foulest of mortal souls-their personalities and memories long since scoured by millennia of torment-would-be devils rise from the masses of suffering souls as lemures, revolting beings of mindless evil potentiality. Only through continued centuries of torture or by the edicts of more powerful devils do these least of devilkind rise to become deadlier fiends, graduating through a pain-wracked metamorphosis dictated by their masters or the infernal whims of Hell's semi-sentient layers. While fiendish lords wield transformation into greater or lesser forms as both prize and punishment, some devils spontaneously rise from particularly evil souls long trapped upon an infernal layer. Thus, although the various diabolical breeds possess recognizable abilities and hold generalized rankings in the great infernal hierarchy, a devil's type alone does not always correspond to a specific tenure of torment or place in the infernal chain of command.

Devils fill the nine layers of Hell, though certain fiends are more common on specific layers than others, their specialized duties or fealty to individual archdevils drawing them to one torturous domain more than others. Although the various types of devils tend to specialize in unique forms of depravity or temptation, the hierarchies of Hell are not without flexibility for uncommon individual talents. Thus, particularly watchful hamatulas might join the ranks of Phlegethon's bone devil inquisitors, while veteran barbazus might serve among the pit fiends of Nessus.

Beyond the pits of Hell, devils often travel to the Material Plane at the summons of evil spellcasters. Quick to bargain and willing to serve mortals to assure their damnation, devils ever obey the letter of their agreements, but serve the whims of Hell foremost. Thus, even the least of devilkind might come to the Material Plane intent on further corrupting souls, cleverly escaping the bonds of their contracts to indulge their own plots, or to further the unspeakable goals of the archdevils of Hell.

The Ranks of Devilkind

Diabolists speak often of the rankings of Hell, the distinctions made between devils that distinguish the foot soldiers from the commanders of Hell's armies. While such divisions mean little to most mortals-a devil being a deadly foe in any incarnation-the hierarchies and nuances of Hell's society carry distinctions vital to the survival of any who would commune with devils. What distinguishes a breed of devils above or below others is more than a matter of brawn, with several cunning types of fiend holding priority over their fundamentally stronger brethren. While a devil's station does not mean it can instantly command every other devil of inferior standing, it does imply which fiends might serve their brethren or hold influence over others.

Below these are the devil races themselves, from the lordly and malevolent pit fiends all the way down to the lowly, malformed lemure.

The Infernal Hierarchy

Listed here, from the absolute weakest devils to the lords of Hell, is the most basic hierarchy of the infernal realm's best-known denizens.

Least Devils: imps, lemures
Lesser Devils: bearded devils (barbazus), erinyes, barbed devils (hamatulas), bone devils (osyluths)
Greater Devils: horned devils (cornugons), ice devils (gelugons), pit fiends
