Description

Deskari's influence upon the Worldwound's verminous
life cannot be ignored for long by visitors to this
tainted land. While some giant vermin have resisted
Deskari's influence, most have succumbed to it. Such
creatures are almost always encountered along the
Worldwound's periphery. As one travels deeper into the
blighted land, the immense insects, spiders, and other
vermin encountered in the canyons and rivers take on
an increasingly unsettling intelligence and demonic
features. In many ways, these demonic vermin are no
longer true denizens of the Material Plane-they are,
after a fact, what happens when the chaos and evil of the
Abyss infuse a mindless creature. They are the unholy
spawn of vermin-and mortal sins.

Countless variations of demonic vermin exist in the
forbidding wasteland that is the Worldwound. When
a nest of similar monsters is encountered, they all
typically share the same demonic powers and traits, but
another nest of the same species could exhibit entirely
different abilities, depending on the nature of the
Abyssal energies that have corrupted and transformed
them. Uncorrupted giant vermin that wander into or
are otherwise brought into the Worldwound do not
immediately fall victim to this vile transformation,
but several months of exposure can, at the GM's whim,
cause such creatures to spontaneously transform into
one of these hideous monstrosities.

Creating a Demonic Vermin

"Demonic vermin" is an inherited or acquired template that
can be added to any vermin (hereafter referred to as the base
creature). A demonic vermin retains all the base creature's
statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: Same as the base creature +1.
Alignment: Chaotic evil.
Type: The creature's type changes to magical beast.
Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. While a demonic
vermin is not an outsider, it is treated as if it had the
demon subtype for the purposes of resolving all effects
relating to that subtype.
Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2.
Special Qualities and Defenses: A demonic vermin gains
immunity to electricity and poison and resistance to acid
10, cold 10, and fire 10. It also gains DR 5/cold iron (if 11 HD
or less) or DR 10/cold iron (if 12 HD or more). As demonic
vermin are intelligent, they lose the mindless trait.
Melee: A demonic vermin's natural weapons are
unchanged, but they are treated as chaotic and evil for
the purpose of resolving damage reduction.
Special Attacks: A demonic vermin retains all the
special attacks of the base creature. In addition, it gains
one of the following special abilities of your choosing-
you can, of course, invent different abilities of your own
as well. The save DC for any of these attacks is equal to 10
+ 1/2 the demonic vermin's HD + the demonic vermin's
Constitution modifier.

Abyssal Energy (Su): Choose one of the following energy
types-acid, fire, or cold. The demonic vermin gains
immunity to that energy type, and also gains a breath
weapon that inflicts that type of energy damage. This
breath weapon is a 60-foot-line, and deals 1d6 points
of damage per CR point possessed by the demonic
vermin (Reflex save halves). It can be used once every
1d4 rounds.

Additional Senses (Ex): The vermin has a large number of
extra eyes and other sensory organs. It gains all-around
vision, scent, and a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks.

Death Throes (Su): When the vermin is slain, it can make
a single melee attack (using any one of its natural
attacks) as an immediate action. It then explodes
into acid, fire, electricity, or cold (your choice),
dealing 1d6 points of damage per CR point
possessed by the demonic vermin (Reflex
save halves).

Diseased (Su): The demonic vermin
is immune to disease, and its natural
attacks inflict demonplague (see page 29)
on a hit (Fortitude save negates).

Drone (Su): By rubbing its wings or limbs
together as a standard action, the demonic
vermin produces a loud, discordant drone
that causes those within 30 feet of it to become sickened
(if the vermin is CR 8 or less) or confused (if the vermin is
CR 9 or higher) for 1d6 rounds (Will save negates). This is
a sonic mind-affecting effect.

Skitter (Ex): The creature has uncanny speed and erratic
movements. The vermin's speeds all increase by 10 feet,
it gains Mobility and Spring Attack as bonus feats, and it
gains a +4 racial bonus on Initiative checks.
Spell-Like Abilities: In addition to gaining one of the
special attacks listed here, all demonic vermin gain access
to a limited number of spell-like abilities, depending on
its Hit Dice. Each ability is usable once per day. Caster
level equals the creature's CR.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>CR</td><td>Abilities</td></tr>
<tr><td>1-4</td><td>darkness</td></tr>
<tr><td>5-8</td><td>vomit swarm</td></tr>
<tr><td>9-12</td><td>insect plague</td></tr>
<tr><td>13-16</td><td>greater teleport (self plus 50 lbs. of objects only)</td></tr>
<tr><td>17-20</td><td>earthquake</td></tr></table>
Abilities: Str +4, Con +2. A demonic vermin's
Intelligence becomes 10 and its Charisma becomes 15
(unless the base creature has higher values, in which case
they remain unchanged).
Feats: A demonic vermin gains feats as appropriate for
its Hit Dice, and gains Toughness as a bonus feat.
Skills: A demonic vermin has skill points per racial Hit
Die equal to 4 + its Intelligence modifier. The following
are class skills for demonic vermin: Acrobatics, Bluff,
Climb, Fly, Knowledge (planes), Perception, Sense Motive,
and Stealth.
Languages: A demonic vermin speaks Abyssal,
Celestial, and Draconic. It also gains telepathy
to a distance of 100 feet.
