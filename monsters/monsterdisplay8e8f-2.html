Description

While most draugr captains were the masters of their ships in life, exceptions have been known to exist, particularly among lowly crew drudges who derived the most power from their transition to undeath. Such gifted individuals are usually seen by their fellow undead crew members as the rightful captains of the ghost ships they have come to command.
