Special Abilities

Divine Resistance (Su) A fomorian titan gains a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 bonus on saving throws against attacks and effects from deities, outsiders who serve a deity, and divine spellcasters.

Divine Spell Perception (Su) A fomorian titan automatically notices divine spellcasting within 60 feet. It automatically pinpoints the location of the caster, identifies the spell being cast, and knows the intended target or area of the spell.

Description

Fomorian titans were the first titans created by the gods. In their pride, the titans intruded on the domain of their masters and created life of their own, so they too might be worshiped. The gods were forced to battle their creations, and though they won, they could not bring themselves to destroy the fomorians, and instead shackled the titans in armor that hid their beauty and imprisoned them in secret prisons across the multiverse.
