Special Abilities

Death Roll (Ex) Upon making a successful grapple check against a foe of its size or smaller, a hetkoshu deals bite damage to the target and knocks it prone. This does not break the hetkoshu's grapple.

Hold Breath (Ex) A hetkoshu can hold its breath for 4 rounds per point of Constitution before having to make Constitution checks to continue holding its breath (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 445).

Savage Rush (Ex) For 1 round per minute, a hetkoshu may sprint with devastating speed, increasing its land speed to 40 feet and allowing it to treat nonmagical difficult terrain as if it were normal terrain. If it charges during this round, it may attack twice with its bite as its attack action, using the same attack modifier for both attacks.

Description

Infamous along Osirion's major rivers as well as in the Golden Oasis near Shiman-Sekh, hetkoshus are among the most dangerous animals on Garund. They pose a constant threat to travelers and those who make their livelihoods along these waterways. Hetkoshus wait for prey to pass within 90 feet before rushing at them to gobble up one or two opponents in a single terrible motion, preferably before the prey even realizes any danger exists. They are known for their feared "death roll"-once one clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim.

Hetkoshus average 30 feet in length and weigh nearly 45,000 pounds.
