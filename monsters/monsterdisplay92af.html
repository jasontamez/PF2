Special Abilities

Freeze (Ex) A stranglereed can hold itself so still that it
appears to be normal vegetation. A stranglereed that
uses this ability can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide
in plain sight as a regular patch of reeds.

Grab (Ex) A stranglereed can grab a foe of up to one size
category larger than itself.

Strangle (Ex) Stranglereeds have an unerring talent
for seizing their victims by the throat. A creature
grappled by a stranglereed can't speak or cast spells
with verbal components.

Suffocate (Ex) A creature affected by a stranglereed's
strangle ability can't breathe and must hold its breath
or suffocate.

Description

Stranglereeds float motionless in calm lakes and
rivers, waiting for prey to approach before lashing
out with thick tendrils, grabbing their targets by the
throat. Once the stranglereed has secured its prey, it pulls
the victim beneath the surface of the water and directs
the meal into it's "mouth," a submerged circular orifice
ringed with gnashing barbs and thorns. Exceptionally
voracious, the stranglereed never stops feeding, and
in desperate times, the industrious plant can leave the
water briefly in order to hunt on land. These vicious
plants may even chase slower prey if it breaks free of their
tendrils, but fortunately, a stranglereed can spend only a
limited amount of time out of water. Each stranglereed
resembles a patch of normal reeds that covers a roughly
circular 10-foot-diameter area, while its large, mawed
central pod normally hides beneath the water's surface.
A stranglereed weighs 800 pounds.

A stranglereed reproduces by expelling seeds that float
on air currents, much like dandelion fluff. Those that
land on dry earth soon die or become meals for birds and
other small animals, but those that land in water grow into
full-sized stranglereed stalks within 1 month. A large body
of water can be home to multiple stranglereeds, but only if
the food supply can meet their demands.
