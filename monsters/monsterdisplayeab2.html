Description

These hulking frogs haunt warm marshlands and river shallows where thick undergrowth can conceal them. They are dangerous, aggressive predators that gorge themselves on smaller creatures or team up to bring down larger prey. They often climb to the low branches of ancient, mossy trees, picking off prey from the wetland's floor before their existence is even suspected.
