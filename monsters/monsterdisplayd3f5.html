Fyndylsnitch the Shadowking - Monsters







Fyndylsnitch the Shadowking

Dressed entirely in gray worn robes, a tiny, otherworldly man
stands cloaked in mysterious shadows, his head crowned by a
mane of wild, fiery-orange hair and his green eyes gleaming
with madness and delight.

Description

A master of shadow magic, Fyndylsnitch delights in using
his craft to warp reality. While it is suspected he holds
great power, the Lord of Drearwood has never moved from
his realm. For this reason, sages speculate he performs
some sort of duty for a greater lord in First World.
