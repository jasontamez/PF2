Special Abilities

Adaptive Defensive Programming (Ex) Three times per day as an immediate action, a gladiator robot can change one of its resistances to any other energy type for 1 minute.

Boosted Charge (Ex) Twice per day, a gladiator robot can make a full-attack action at the end of a charge instead of a single attack.

Dense Structure (Ex) A gladiator robot gains bonus hit points as if it were a construct two sizes larger.

Flexible Programming (Ex) Ten times per day as an immediate action, a gladiator robot can gain the benefit of any feat for which it qualifies but does not have. Each feat remains in effect for 1 minute. In addition, it counts its racial Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. If it has levels in fighter, these Hit Dice stack with these levels.

Integrated Weaponry (Ex) A gladiator robot's arms have integrated weaponry. These weapons cannot be disarmed, removed, or sundered. A gladiator robot's programming allows it to wield these weapons as if it were proficient in their use.

Adamantine Chainsaw (Ex): Two of a gladiator robot's arms link into a motor-driven chainsaw with adamantine cutters and chain.

Adamantine Buzz Saw (Ex): One of a gladiator robot's arms ends in a spinning blade.

Hypersonic Rifle (Ex): One of a gladiator robot's arms ends in a powerful rifle that fires metal slugs at hypersonic velocities. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d12 points of damage. A creature struck must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or become stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.

Overclocked Targeting (Ex) Gladiator robots operate beyond the limits of stability and safety. A gladiator robot that suffers a critical hit does not become staggered or stunned as is normal for a robot, but it loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe. Upon taking a critical hit, the gladiator robot must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save. On a success, for the following round it attacks a randomly determined target within 60 feet. On a failed save, it attacks random targets for the following 1d4+1 rounds.

Programmed to Entertain (Ex) A gladiator robot gains Intimidate and Perform (gladiator) as class skills and gains a +2 bonus on performance combat checks.

Resilient (Ex) Gladiator robots receive a +5 racial bonus on all saving throws.

Superior Optics (Ex) Gladiator robots see invisible creatures or objects as if they were visible.

Work the Crowd (Ex) Gladiator robots are programmed to reward themselves for victory and showiness. As a swift action after reducing a foe to 0 hit points or otherwise incapacitating it, a gladiator robot can attempt a DC 20 Perform (gladiator) check. If it succeeds, the gladiator robot recovers 4d10 hit points, up to its maximum hit points. This ability functions only if the incapacitating action is observed by a <a href="rulesd9e0.html?Name=City%20Streets&amp;Category=Urban%20Features">crowd</a> and must be performed on the same round as felling a foe or the round immediately after.

Description

Adaptable in combat and programmed to entertain, gladiator robots are designed to provide a vicarious experience to sate spectators' primal bloodlust. They fight with a passion that makes many observers forget they are watching a machine instead of a living being. Constructed to move with grace and swagger both in and out of battle, they are agile and incredibly strong for their size. Gladiator robots stand 6 feet tall but are constructed of dense metals and weigh 450 pounds.

Built from some of the rarest high-tech materials and weapons acquired by the Technic League, gladiator robots usually serve as entertainment in the blood- and oil-smeared fighting pits of Starfall in Numeria, although they have been spotted less commonly in Tymon in the River Kingdoms and Oppara in Taldor. Owned almost exclusively by high-ranking members of the Technic League, gladiator robots often operate as personal bodyguards when not participating in gladiatorial combat, although their tendency toward targeting errors makes them risky protectors.

The inherent danger of spectating a gladiatorial contest starring a gladiator robot draws crowds from far and wide, although it necessitates either large, open arenas or protective structures like walls and raised seats to keep the crowd safe. Many cities that normally allow gladiatorial combat have banned competition involving these robots after incidents of audience members being targeted following a lucky hit against the robot.

While most robots behave in a logical and emotionless way, gladiator robots are gregarious, outgoing, and attention-seeking. Their voices are loud, upbeat, and cheerful, and they endlessly narrate their own actions in battle while providing commentary on their opponents and their actions. This attitude and presence stands in sharp contrast to their menacing, heavily-armored chassis and powerful weapons; these disparate elements make for a combination their opponents find unnerving. Spectators, however, love the bluster and braggadocio of a gladiator robot, often waiting after a match in hopes of meeting it. In Oppara, this tradition is taken even further, with young children running up to a victorious gladiator robot with two rags: a clean one to wipe away blood and grime, and an oiled one to shine its armor to brilliance. They then sell these rags to wealthy nobles for a few gold pieces each.

Since their programming has been pushed to the limits of their capacity, gladiator robots are prone to develop quirks and bugs in their behavior. Despite frequently being sent back to technicians for repair, gladiator robots often develop personality traits that begin to blur the line between machines and living creatures. While most of these quirks tend to emulate personalities that are brash and energetic, some gladiator robots become enamored of death. These robots are likely the source of rumors about out-of-control "kill bots" that view killing as pleasure.

Stories of gladiator robots leaving the service of their masters and taking up free lives on their own may be nothing more than Andoren propaganda, but such tales are appealing enough that several have spread throughout the Inner Sea. One famous tale is told by Mendevian Knights who watched a "man of metal" walk directly into hordes of demons near the Worldwound, shouting challenges the entire way. Whether the robot survived- or the story is true-is unclear.

Products of technology advanced far beyond even those of the gunsmiths of Alkenstar, robots represent constructs animated by engineering and advanced science rather than magic. The people of Golarion think of robots as "automatons" or "metal men"-their proper nomenclature is known to only a few.

The first robots arrived untold years ago, when a ship from beyond the stars smashed into Golarion. The metal vessel entered the atmosphere in a blaze of fire and broke apart, scattering fragments across the plains of Numeria. Over the following centuries, several varieties of robots emerged or were recovered from some of these ruins. A few still follow the alien dictates of their original programming, while others run amok, their directives corrupted or forgotten. Perhaps the best-known robots are the fabled gearsmen, a veritable army of humanoid robots found stored and awaiting orders in a massive hold in Silver Mount.

The means of commanding robots vary from model to model, a source of endless frustration for Numerian artificers. Some obey orders from any humanoid, some bond to a specific master until her death, and others yield only to the command of brooches or rods recovered from Silver Mount. Still others submit after mechanical surgery, or not all. A surprisingly large fraction of uncontrolled robots already speak Common or Hallit. Most models exhibit considerable linguistic talents, and the robots train each other in their new home's languages. Despite comprehending Numerian languages, most robots rarely speak save for terse acknowledgments and orders.

The Robot Subtype

"Robot" is a special subtype that can be applied to any construct without changing its CR. Robots share some features with clockwork constructs (The Inner Sea World Guide 256), and as with clockworks, you can simply remove the robot subtype and its traits to transform it into a typical construct animated by magic. A construct cannot possess both the robot and the clockwork subtypes. All robots gain the following traits, unless noted otherwise. <ul><li>Intelligent: Robots are intelligent, and thus have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice. Unless otherwise indicated for a specific robot, all robots have Intelligence scores of 10. The following are class skills for robots: Climb, Disable Device, Fly, Knowledge (all), Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive.</li><li>Vulnerable to Critical Hits: Whenever a robot takes extra damage from a critical hit, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1 round. If it makes a successful saving throw, it is staggered for 1 round. The robot remains immune to other sources of the stunned condition.</li><li>Vulnerable to Electricity: Robots take 150% as much damage as normal from electricity attacks, unless they are immune to electricity via other special defenses.</li><li>Difficult to Create: Robots are crafted via complex methods hidden and well guarded in Numerian ruins or other technological bastions. While the Technic League has developed magical solutions to some of these requirements, actual details on creating robots are beyond the scope of this book.</li></ul>

Numerian Technology

Miraculous and deadly treasures lie in wait in Numerian dungeons, and the robots that dwell there often utilize these technological arms and tools themselves. A robot's weapons and defenses are fueled by its central energy core, and unless otherwise indicated, a robot's weapons and defenses have infinite ammunition and power.

Force Fields: A force field sheathes a robot in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants a number of bonus hit points that varies according to the robot (typically 5 x the robot's CR). All damage dealt to a robot with an active force field is reduced from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the robot is immune to critical hits. A force field has fast healing equal to the robot's CR, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.

Integrated Weaponry: A robot that has a technological weapon (such as a laser rif le or chain gun) built into its body treats such weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons attacks, and cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. Integrated weaponry can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but as a general rule cannot be harvested for use outside of the robot's body once the robot is destroyed. A robot is always proficient with its integrated weapons. Integrated ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat.

Laser Weapons: These weapons emit beams of intensely focused light waves that resolve as touch attacks and deal fire damage. A laser can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by a laser weapon. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks.

Plasma Weapons: These weapons emit bursts of superheated, electrically charged gas known as plasma. A plasma weapon's attacks resolve as touch attacks. Half the damage dealt by plasma is fire damage, and half is electricity damage.

Products of advanced scientific technology, the constructs called robots are animated by engineering and advanced science rather than magic. Most people refer to robots as "automatons" or "metal men"; their proper nomenclature is known to only a few. Unlike most constructs, robots are capable of independent thought. However, they still must obey the programming instilled in them at their creation. Any robot whose creator hard-coded limitations into its programming can never be truly autonomous.

Robots almost always arise from cultures that possess technology that is leaps and bounds ahead of other civilizations, though sometimes they appear due to cultural diffusion from such a society. A wrecked spacecraft, a portal through time, or a group of robots mass-producing others of their kind could all bring robots into a world. Robots that appear from another place or time might still follow the alien dictates of their original programming, or could run amok, their directives corrupted or forgotten. Whatever the case, these robots possess technology that is beyond the means of almost anyone to reproduce, and they represent a stark contrast to other constructs, as they have nothing to do with magic.

Some spellcasters, despite lacking any real grasp on the technological principles required to create robots, have managed to create their own robots by cobbling together spare parts and broken machines, filling in the gaps and completing the design with a mixture of magic and barely understood fragments of science. These inferior designs usually lack the inexhaustible power supplies, advanced intellects, and self-repair systems found in the original robots, and the magic used in their creation can potentially render them more susceptible to techniques that work against other sorts of constructs.

Robots serve a wide range of purposes, from warfare and defense to peaceful tasks like excavation, farming, and maintenance. Small villages that find robots and somehow manage to command them will often put them to work quietly tending fields or constructing buildings all day long. Armies and warlords collect the more dangerous varieties of robots, but even the more ordinary varieties can be deadly. Most robots sport alloyed skin as hard as steel, meaning that even the lowliest worker robot presents a potent threat when altered for battle. Furthermore, since most cultures lack a means to reliably repair or understand how to command robots, even the most benign one might malfunction, or even reach a point in its programming where it changes its activity and refuses to follow orders, leading to untold death and destruction among the its former temporary masters.

The means of commanding robots vary from model to model, which can be a source of endless frustration for any who seek to control them. Some obey orders from any humanoid, some bond to a specific master until her death, and others only yield to the command of technological brooches or control rods. Still others submit after mechanical surgery or rebuilding, or not at all. Many must be given extremely precise instructions, for they are unable to process metaphors or other figures of speech, and may interpret them in unanticipated ways, much to the chagrin of those who would command them. A surprisingly large proportion of uncontrolled robots already speak Common, as most models exhibit considerable linguistics talent, and the robots train each other in their new home's languages. Though they comprehend language, most robots rarely speak save for terse acknowledgements of orders. Their speech typically excludes words they deem unnecessary with their mechanical efficiency, leading to strange disjointed statements that convey the requisite information without emotion, although some robots programmed to interact well with humans are able to speak in a more fluid and less disconcerting manner.

Constructing a robot requires no magic, but does involve advanced and extraordinarily rare materials and technological expertise. Because almost no one possesses the skills and materials to complete the process of constructing a robot, these entries omit the construction sections provided for most constructs. A GM can add the robot subtype to a different type of construct, such as an animated object or homunculus, to create new types of robots. Typically, this doesn't alter the construct's CR. A character can't create a robot from or add the robot subtype to a construct that has already been created; adding the <a href="monstersubtypes338d.html?ItemName=Robot">robot subtype</a> to an existing creature is purely a means for the GM to simulate additional robots beyond those provided here.
