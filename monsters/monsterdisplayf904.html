Description

Giant crabs behave much like their smaller cousins, feeding on both plant material like algae and fungus and animal matter such as fish, seabirds, and even unwary humanoids. The coloration of a giant crab's hard exoskeleton varies widely depending on species, and over time even shifts in response to its diet.

Other species of giant crab exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger. You can adjust the stats given here by changing Hit Dice and size (changing Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of different species of giant crab.
