Hala - Monsters







Demon, Hala

Skin the color of thunderheads and wings made for soaring through the most violent winds mark this lean, cyclopic being as a master of terrible storms. The sound of shrieking wind emanates from its mouth full of needle-sharp teeth.

Special Abilities

Enemy of Dragons and Eagles (Ex) Halas are hated enemies of dragons and eagles. Those creatures gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against hala demons.

Hailstorm (Su) A hala can call down hailstones from surrounding clouds once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. These hailstones deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 1d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius that have no overhead cover. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. To use this ability, the hala must be outside and there must be clouds in the sky.

Stormwind Aura (Su) Halas surround themselves with a buffeting shroud of supernatural, windstorm-force winds. These winds shield a hala from any other wind effects and form a shell of breathable air around it, allowing the hala to breathe underwater. Ranged weapons and gases directed toward a hala are affected as the spell wind wall.

Vengeful Wind (Su) Anytime a hala takes damage from a critical hit, a powerful blast of wind explodes forth in the direction of the attacker. This blast takes the form of a 60-foot-long gale, treated as a gust of wind spell, directed from the hala toward the opponent that scored the critical hit against it (if that creature is more than 60 feet away, the wind is aimed in its direction but doesn't come close enough to affect it). This wind is also charged with electricity. Any creature in or that enters the area of effect must make a DC 14 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Hala demons are commonly known as storm demons. Bound to service by Pazuzu, these demons ride the winds across the Abyssal skies, lurk within dark and turbulent clouds, and act as his scouts and spies. Halas have a single, blood-red eye, an enormous mouth lined with razor-sharp teeth, and lengthy horns growing from their heads.

A typical hala stands 7 feet tall, weighs 200 pounds, and possesses large wings that span 20 feet across.

Ecology

Hala demons form from covetous souls, those who desired the possessions of others so much so that they indulged in such acts as murder, theft, or blackmail. The more persons harmed by these desires, the more likely the soul is to become a hala in the Abyss.

Halas are masters of the winds, harnessing the power of storms, redirecting and amplifying that energy to cause the most damage and chaos possible. They relish the destructive forces of their storms, and can manipulate a storm's energy to rain down hailstones to pelt the area. Their command of the winds also aids them in f light. They are never impeded by storm winds, but instead ride them, often achieving top speeds by accelerating the wind currents around them.

Due to the nature of their origin, halas are highly possessive. A hala will often refer to the storm clouds they marshal as "my storm." A hala is predisposed to grab any item it finds particularly desirable, and will actively pillage regions that its storm passes over. The desire to take from others remains so prevalent in the hala's nature that it often carries large sacks in which to place all the items it takes during its f lights. Bags of holding or handy haversacks are highly prized possessions to a hala, as it allows it to pillage even more items. Halas are voracious, with large mouths that open nearly ear-to-ear. Edible items they find in their pillaging are often consumed immediately. This includes a particular appetite for children and other Small humanoids.

Habitat & Society

Halas can be seen throughout the Abyss, roaming the skies in servitude to Pazuzu as his dedicated scout force. Their heaviest concentration, however, exists in High M-Vania, as all hala demons are required to return to Pazuzu's realm once a century to report all that they have observed. Despite the duty to return to High M-Vania, halas are solitary demons, distrusting all others, especially other hala demons, fearing that they will attempt to take their pillaged possessions. Therefore, most halas live in isolated, remote areas where they maintain their hoards of ill-gotten gains.

Pazuzu values his hala minions not only for the intelligence they gather on the activities of his enemies in the Abyss, but also for the chaos and destruction they bring on the winds. He is especially fond of sending halas to the Material Plane to ravage the countryside with storms and hail. As in the Abyss, halas on the Material Plane prefer to reside in remote areas. The lair of a hala is often located in a hidden cave in an isolated mountain range, or in the hollow of a giant, ancient tree deep in a forest or swamp.

While hala demons have a general dislike for or distrust of nearly all creatures, they have an especially strong fear and hatred of two creatures: eagles and dragons. Eagles have an innate response to attack and drive a hala from the skies, possibly due to the threat the hala represents to the eagle's territory and offspring. Dragons-of any breed-largely view the storm demons as a danger to their own hoards of treasure, for if a hala discovers the dragon's lair, it will stop at nothing to possess all that lies within it.

Demons exist for one reason-to destroy. Where their more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape them into reflections of their own evil, demons seek only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy-for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon's depredations and flee to his just reward in the afterlife. It is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels a demon's lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.

Demons are the most prolific and among the most destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across the multiverse as the Abyss. Before the first fledgling deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully formed, the Abyss was infested with life.

Known to many scholars as "proto-demons," these wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, because of the influence of sinful mortal souls upon the Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the daemonic keepers of Abaddon and the cruel whims of fate and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the demonic hordes grows-a single soul can fuel the manifestation of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes and roles of the newly formed fiends.

The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the Maelstrom itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. Some flop on land while others flap in air or sea. Some are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work to the same goal-pain and suffering for mortal life in all its forms.

Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most demons find ways to twist their summoners' demands so that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks free of his control.

The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic sires to gift them with horrific children are common enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in support of that which would bring destruction to all.
