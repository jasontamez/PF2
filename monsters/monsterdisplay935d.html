Special Abilities

Bloodbath (Su) Pallid angels are avatars of slaughter,
delighting in the bloody carnality of combat. When a pallid
angel kills a creature using a manufactured melee weapon,
she can splash its blood (or similar remains) on herself
as a free action, even if it's not her turn. This grants her 8
temporary hit points and a +2 profane bonus to Strength.
These benefits stack with themselves, to a maximum of 40
temporary hit points and a +10 bonus to Strength, and they
last until 1 minute after the pallid angel last used this ability.

Hunger for Life and Death (Su) A pallid angel is healed by
both positive and negative energy. In addition, whenever a
positive energy or negative energy effect would heal or harm
one or more creatures within 30 feet, the pallid angel can
consume the energy as an immediate action. The pallid angel
regains a number of hit points equal to the greatest amount of
healing or damage a targeted creature would receive, and no
other creatures are affected by the effect. A pallid angel can
consume energy this way three times per day.

Profane Ward (Su) A pallid angel's spell resistance is
increased by 5 against spells with the good descriptor and
spells cast by worshippers of good-aligned deities.

Description

Urgathoa is known best as a goddess of plague and
undeath, yet the Pallid Princess has wider interests than
the uninitiated might assume. Pallid angels, created by
Urgathoa from the souls of her most dedicated champions
and priestesses, represent these interests. Warriors and
tacticians, wielders of profane magic and cruel weaponry,
pallid angels are embodiments of the goddess's appetite
for wanton bloodshed and forbidden pleasures.

The average pallid angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs
200 pounds.

Ecology

Created by Urgathoa as mockeries of true angels, pallid
angels strongly resemble the celestial beings for which
they were named, and if cleansed of the stains of their
hedonism they can often pass for such goodly creatures.
Pallid angels particularly enjoy such deceptions, taking
advantage of gullible mortals to revel in their adulation
and spread the indulgent ways of the Pallid Princess.
However, unlike true angels, pallid angels are universally
female, with bodies resembling those they had or most
desired in life.

As outsiders, pallid angels have no need to eat or sleep;
however, befitting their nature as favored servants of the
goddess of indulgence, they seek out and revel in the
pleasures of the flesh. Though any act of carnal pleasure
is of interest to them, great feasts both mundane and
cannibalistic, sexual excesses, and intoxicants of every
variety are common pursuits for pallid angels. Most
pallid angels also blend their hedonism with enjoyment
of milder sensual delights such as massages, luxurious
comforts and furnishings, and even long periods of
indolent slumber, for less intense acts make the greater
pleasures all the more ecstatic by comparison.

In addition to their hedonistic urges, pallid angels' love
of violence and bloodshed drives them to brutally abuse,
and often eventually slay, any innocent unfortunate
enough to fall into their grasp. Pallid angels take great
pleasure in tormenting hostages and prisoners of war, and
they occasionally spare unconscious foes for this purpose.
A pallid angel denied such victims eventually sates her
violent urges upon her companions and servants.

Habitat and Society

If the daughters of Urgathoa are the goddess's most
favored servants in life and unlife, pallid angels are her
most favored in what comes after both. Pallid angels are
created by Urgathoa from the souls of her greatest female
worshippers, given bodies capable of enjoying all the
pleasures of the flesh as reward for their service.
In Urgathoa's domain on Abaddon, pallid
angels spend much of their time indulging
their desires, though most also serve
as governors, arbiters, and vicious
defenders against psychopomp raids.

Pallid angels are often sent in
response to planar ally spells or
called by planar binding spells;
a wise caller is ready to satisfy
the angel's hedonism, such as
by casting heroes' feast for the
angel's exclusive benefit. Pallid
angels are often conjured to
serve as generals of great armies,
particularly those heavy with
undeath. Several pallid angels
served the Whispering Tyrant as
commanders in his initial conquest of Ustalav; at least one
remains somewhere in the mountains of Virlych, magically
entrapped by Arazni before her death at the Tyrant's hands.

In addition to the angels' role as military leaders, small
cults or lone priests might call upon a pallid angel to
defend their sanctum from invaders or aid an assault
against the forces of good, while hedonistic cults or
worshippers occasionally conjure pallid angels simply to
share in their pleasures. Urgathoa sometimes sends pallid
angels to such pleasure cults unbidden, especially if such
a cult has not yet descended fully into evil; the pallid angel
serves as a guide to even more perverse indulgences and
ensures the cult's corruption to Urgathoa's service.

Pallid angels and daughters of Urgathoa both hold
great authority and honor among the faithful of the
Pallid Princess, and many of those who eventually
became pallid angels were first elevated to be daughters
of Urgathoa upon their mortal deaths. When brought
together, pallid angels serve as a martial counterpart to
the more ecclesiastical role played by daughters, much
like the paladins and clerics of good faiths. In such cases,
pallid angels and daughters cooperate in service to the
goddess's will, though their relationship is often strained.
Pallid angels often treat daughters with subtle pity and
condescension for their reduced access to physical
pleasures and their less direct relationship to Urgathoa,
while daughters frequently hold angels in quiet contempt
for their status as living-and thus less perfect-beings.
