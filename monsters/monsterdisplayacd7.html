Special Abilities

Dream Passage (Su) A dream naga can physically enter dreamscapes in the Dimension of Dreams (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 241) and dwell within those dreams without disorientation or other debilitating effects. The naga can also attempt impossible feats while in a dreamscape in its physical body, and it gains the bonuses from the Lucid Dreamer feat when it does.

Dreamsight (Ex) Just by looking at a dreaming creature or when in a dreamscape in the Dimension of Dreams, a dream naga gains a general sense of the nature of the dream. While the dream naga's vision is not detailed, it gets a general impression of the dream's themes and the dreamer's current emotional state.

Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Will DC 21; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect daze 1 round; cure 1 save.

Spells (Sp) A dream naga casts spells as a 7th-level psychic (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 60).

Description

Inhabitants of the Dimension of Dreams, dream nagas fly through dreamscapes as part of an unknowable plan to alter the destiny of the multiverse. Most creatures that encounter dream nagas do so while they sleep, as their dreams provide convenient shortcuts for the dream nagas' paths through the various dreamscapes. Even after these dreamers awaken, the sight of these beautiful creatures remains ingrained in their minds. Many cultures consider seeing a dream naga a sign of a special destiny. But when a dreaming creature gains the full attention of a dream naga, it is no mere chance encounter. For convoluted and arcane reasons that only they truly understand, dream nagas enter dreams and interact with the sleepers-sometimes relaying knowledge to the sleepers, and other times tormenting them. Such dream encounters often don't make sense to the dreaming creature until some point far in the future, if ever.
