Description

Razormouths most often reside in mountainous areas or large canyons with steep cliffs. While most creatures would find such areas difficult to traverse, razormouths are especially mobile, being choice climbers that are able to leap from cliff faces to outcrops with singular alacrity. This exceptional mobility, along with a devastating pair of long, serrated fangs, make the fearsome razormouths unparalleled hunters, and few survive getting too close to their fangs.
