Special Abilities

Distracting Cacophony (Su) Although a syncytium is not intelligent enough to understand language, its halfformed mouths constantly emit a distracting cacophony of sounds and nonsense words. A syncytium can activate this ability is a free action. All other creatures in a 30-foot radius must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by this proto-shoggoth's distracting cacophony again for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Merge (Ex) As a full-round action, two proto-shoggoth syncytia can attempt to merge (see the Merge entry in the proto-shoggoth stat block on page 90); each must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save in order to merge. If both succeed at this save, they combine to form a fully-grown shoggoth (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 249).

Description

Early attempts by the elder things (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 85) to craft life resulted in strange, heaving masses of protoplasm that displayed a disturbing hunger for living flesh. Emboldened by this discovery, the alien scientists soon stabilized this matter, resulting in the creation of the first proto-shoggoths.

A proto-shoggoth appears as a tangled mass of roiling flesh and organs weighing approximately 160 pounds, and is capable of forming all manner of hideous and nauseating shapes.

Ecology

Proto-shoggoths have a singularly unusual and disturbing life cycle. While certain vile procedures can result in the artificial creation of a new protoshoggoth, these creatures can also spawn new proto-shoggoths by infecting the bodies of other living creatures. Yet to grow, a protoshoggoth does not feed-instead, it seeks out others of its kind to perform a voluntary sort of cannibalism with them, consuming and being consumed, and ultimately combining to manifest a larger version of the whole. Protoshoggoths thus do not advance in power via the standard rules for increasing a creature's size detailed in Appendix 2 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.

Habitat and Society

Proto-shoggoths have no true society, and are driven by two overwhelming instincts: the urge to infect living flesh, and the urge to merge with other proto-shoggoths. Once a creature succumbs to such an infestation, a proto-shoggoth instinctually knows to linger in the area and attempts to merge with its freshly born offspring when it erupts from the victim's body. A proto-shoggoth tends not to remain in proximity with others of its kind that it has failed to merge with, but is not hostile toward such incompatible specimens.

Once two proto-shoggoths successfully merge and form a proto-shoggoth syncytium, the syncytium gains a rudimentary intellect that allows it to more successfully seek out others to merge with and finish the growth cycle into a full-fledged shoggoth. It can no longer infect flesh, though, nor can it merge with other nonsyncytium proto-shoggoths, but it does understand that lingering in areas where other proto-shoggoths are active will, eventually, give it opportunities to grow. A proto-shoggoth syncytium often acts as a protector over its mindless "children" and has been known to use rudimentary cunning to lure (or more often chase) unsuspecting living creatures into proto-shoggoth nests.

Half-formed eyes, toothless mouths, gaping throats, and countless other malformed organs constantly form and dissolve over this monster's surface.
