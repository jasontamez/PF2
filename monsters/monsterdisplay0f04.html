Description

Wereraptors fuse the senses of a predatory bird and the unique skills and traits of a humanoid, and thus enjoy heightened awareness and nimbleness. Like their animal kin, wereraptors are calculating and insightful, making them particularly adept hunters. Their aesthetic traits vary based on their avian lineage, but wereraptors share a common array of physical properties. Natural wereraptors appear to be normal members of their humanoid race, though they have light hair, thin frames, and sharp facial features. They typically stand taller than other members of their race and have lithe bodies.

Ecology

Wereraptors derive their traits from their particular avian lineages, with eagles, hawks, falcons, and vultures being among the most common wereraptor derivations. The different manifestations of these physical characteristics-such as varied plumage and beak shapes-can result in wereraptors with greatly diverse appearances sharing the same environments and regions.

Although wereraptors can integrate with civilized society more easily than other lycanthropes, a few notable features cause them to stand out. All wereraptors are born with prominently colored eyes with irises that fill the majority of the eye. The bright yellows, reds, and blues of wereraptors' eyes are overlooked among elves or gnomes, but are more difficult to ignore in human cultures. In addition, wereraptor facial structures favor high cheekbones, sharp noses, and pointed chins. These attributes can draw unwanted attention, prompting most wereraptors to prefer a life of seclusion.

Acute senses are prevalent among all wereraptors. Their sight and hearing are augmented to the point of being overwhelming. Natural wereraptors easily adapt to these senses as they grow, but that feat proves far more difficult for afflicted wereraptors. Increased perception does not manifest until the first transformation under a full moon. After returning to humanoid form, wereraptors find their eyes involuntarily focusing on extremely distant objects, while their ears reverberate with the sound of thundering whispers and booming heartbeats. The sensory burden sometimes becomes too much to bear, causing an afflicted wereraptor to panic for the first days of this experience. Both afflicted and natural wereraptors eventually learn to use their senses to discern involuntary responses in a person's body, allowing them a greater degree of insight when interacting with others. To outsiders, this appears to be innate intuition concerning emotions.

In their animal forms, wereraptors appear to be larger, more savage versions of their avian kind. The excruciating process of changing shape leads many wereraptors to remain in their hybrid forms at all times; plus, reverting to their humanoid form causes the almost instantaneous molting of feathers, which can be easily tracked.

Like their avian kin, wereraptors are primarily carnivores. Ready access to food allows most wereraptors to keep their bestial natures in check, though some isolationists surrender to their instincts entirely. Once a wereraptor's primal urges have taken over, it sets out to find a fitting kill to sate its compulsions, even if this takes days to accomplish. Afflicted wereraptors frequently find their internal struggle overwhelming, bordering on maddening. The sight of carrion can be enticing to wereraptors and is particularly disruptive to those whose avian kin are scavengers.

Habitat and Society

The transformative nature and territorial temperaments of wereraptors leads to the majority being self-imposed outcasts. They often take homes in remote locations favored by their avian kind, usually in forests or mountains, and eke out simple lifestyles. Wereraptors tend to clash with each other when their hunting grounds overlap. The conflict between the parties can escalate to the point that a duel is declared. These duels are always held within neutral territory and involve a hunt of some kind. A hunt may be for a specific creature, such as a notable predator of the region. Other times, the participants become the prey themselves, with each party attempting to capture or slay the other.

Wereraptors also tend to find integration within established societies somewhat of a challenge. When interacting with others, wereraptors can come off as abrasive and reclusive. Their heightened sense of awareness causes many wereraptors to habitually watch others for uncomfortable lengths of time. This, in addition to their odd physical features, can quickly create a minor rift between the wereraptors and the rest of many civilized societies, which often leads to the wereraptors being ostracized. These effects are lessened in smaller or more tolerant settlements, where community members just write off the wereraptors as strange.

Lycanthropes are humanoids with the ability to turn into animals and animal-humanoid hybrid shapes. Natural lycanthropes are born with this ability and have perfect control over their shapechanging. Afflicted lycanthropes contract this ability like a curse or disease from another lycanthrope; they sometimes change form involuntarily.

Creating a Lycanthrope

"Lycanthrope" is an inherited (for natural lycanthropes) or acquired (for afflicted lycanthropes) template that can be added to any humanoid.

Challenge Rating: Same as base creature or base animal (whichever is higher) + 1.

Size and Type: The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) gains the shapechanger subtype. The lycanthrope takes on the characteristics of some type of animal (referred to hereafter as the base animal) within one size category of the base creature's size. A lycanthrope's hybrid form is the same size as the base animal or the base creature, whichever is larger.

AC: In hybrid or animal form the lycanthrope has the natural armor bonus of the base animal increased by +2.

Defensive Abilities: A natural lycanthrope gains DR 10/silver in animal or hybrid form. An afflicted lycanthrope gains DR 5/silver in animal or hybrid form.

Speed: Same as the base creature or base animal, depending on which form the lycanthrope is using. Hybrids use the base creature's speed.

Melee: A lycanthrope gains natural attacks in animal and hybrid forms according to the base animal.

Special Attacks: A lycanthrope retains all the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base creature. In hybrid or animal form it gains the special attacks, qualities, and abilities of the base animal. A lycanthrope also gains low-light vision, scent, and the following:

Change Shape (Su) All lycanthropes have three forms-a humanoid form, an animal form, and a hybrid form. Equipment does not meld with the new form between humanoid and hybrid form, but does between those forms and animal form. A natural lycanthrope can shift to any of its three alternate forms as a move-equivalent action. An afflicted lycanthrope can assume animal or hybrid form as a full-round action by making a DC 15 Constitution check, or humanoid form as a full-round action by making a DC 20 Constitution check. On nights when the full moon is visible, an afflicted lycanthrope gains a +5 morale bonus to Constitution checks made to assume animal or hybrid form, but a -5 penalty to Constitution checks made to assume humanoid form. An afflicted lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form automatically with the next sunrise, or after 8 hours of rest, whichever comes first. A slain lycanthrope reverts to its humanoid form, although it remains dead.

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) A natural lycanthrope's bite attack in animal or hybrid form infects a humanoid target with lycanthropy (Fortitude DC 15 negates). If the victim's size is not within one size category of the lycanthrope, this ability has no effect.

Lycanthropic Empathy (Ex) In any form, natural lycanthropes can communicate and empathize with animals related to their animal form. They can use Diplomacy to alter such an animal's attitude, and when so doing gain a +4 racial bonus on the check. Afflicted lycanthropes only gain this ability in animal or hybrid form.

Ability Scores: +2 Wis, -2 Cha in all forms; +2 Str, +2 Con in hybrid and animal forms. Lycanthropes have enhanced senses but are not fully in control of their emotions and animalistic urges. In addition to these adjustments to the base creature's stats, a lycanthrope's ability scores change when he assumes hybrid or animal form. In human form, the lycanthrope's ability scores are unchanged from the base creature's form. In animal and hybrid form, the lycanthrope's ability scores are the same as the base creature's or the base animal's, whichever ability score is higher.

Lycanthropy

A creature that catches lycanthropy becomes an afflicted lycanthrope, but shows no symptoms (and does not gain any of the template's adjustments or abilities) until the night of the next full moon, when the victim involuntarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own identity. The character remains in animal form until the next dawn and remembers nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he makes a DC 20 Will save, in which case he becomes aware of his condition.

A remove disease or heal spell cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher cures the affliction, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting lycanthrope's attack. Alternatively, consuming a dose of wolfsbane (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 560) gives an afflicted lycanthrope a new Fortitude save to recover from lycanthropy.
