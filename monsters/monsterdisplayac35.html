Special Abilities

Consume Prey (Ex) If a deep walker successfully grapples a foe, as a swift action it can make a bite attack at a +21 bonus against that foe. If it hits, it deals 2d6+9 points of damage and drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The deep walker regains 1 PE for each point of Constitution damage it deals in this way (up to its maximum PE).

Crab Walk (Ex) A deep walker ignores difficult terrain. In addition, when a deep walker takes a charge or run action, it can make one turn of up to 90 degrees during its movement.

Psychic Protection (Su) A deep walker adds its Charisma modifier (+5 for most deep walkers) to its Armor Class as a deflection bonus and to its Fortitude saves as a resistance bonus.

Description

Deep walkers are among the largest creatures bred by the aboleths. A deepwalker weighs around 10 tons, and when reared up to its full height, it's 35 feet tall.

Deep walkers prefer to feed on blood, especially that of intelligent creatures. While they can at times be encountered alone in the ocean wilds, they are most common in realms controlled by aboleths, where they serve as guardians for these mysterious underwater enclaves or as devastating amphibious assault forces against coastal targets. Those few that have managed to escape direct aboleth control remain vile and cruel sadists, and they often rule over their own petty kingdoms of lesser creatures that they can torment and consume.
