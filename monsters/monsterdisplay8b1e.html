Description

The immense megalania is often mistaken for a dragon or dinosaur. Certainly the lizard's aggressive attitude and deep, rumbling roars only encourage such misidentifications. Large enough to catch and eat rhinos and elephants, a megalania prefers hunting much smaller prey that it can gulp down in one greedy swallow. Humanoids are among its favorite meals.

A megalania is 20 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds.
