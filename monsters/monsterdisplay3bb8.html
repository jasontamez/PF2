Arcanaton - Monsters







Arcanaton

This fiery sphere of energy pulses like an ember in a warm hearth. Three silver eyes swim across the globe's surface, widening and narrowing as they consider their prey, and three whip-like tentacles slowly twitch in the manner of a cat's tail.

Special Abilities

Arcane Consumption (Su) A successful tentacle attack by an arcanaton conveys the effects of a targeted dispel magic (9th level caster), affecting worn magical protections first and proceeding to spells in effect on the target once all worn magical protections have been suppressed. Any magic weapon or magic object touching an arcanaton (including melee attacks) is treated as the subject of a targeted dispel magic (9th level caster). Each successful suppression of a magic item or spell dispelled grants the arcanaton 3 temporary hp.

Arcane Fire (Su) An arcanaton can fire a bolt of raw magical energy as a standard action. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with 190 ft. range that deals 9d6 points of damage.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An arcanaton is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted here. A magical attack that dispels magical effects, such as dispel magic, slows an arcanaton (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. If an arcanaton contacts an antimagic field, it is stunned for 1d4 rounds, with no saving throw.

Description

Arcanatons are elementals of magic, the raw stuff of dweomer given sentience. Their origin is unknown, and while legends indicate their summoning and binding was once commonplace, it is now a lost art. They seek out areas of active magic and consume what they can, but they are not unreasoning parasites, and some mages report successfully appeasing an arcanaton and sending it on its way.

Environment: Any area of high magic.

Typical Physical Characteristics: Arcanatons measure five to six feet in diameter, with tentacles seven to ten feet in length. They are weightless. Their coloration intensifies after consuming magical energy, and pales when they are deprived of it.
