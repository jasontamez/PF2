Special Abilities

Devour (Su) A mountain giant can devour a Large or smaller humanoid corpse as full-round action. Doing so grants the giant fast healing 10 for a number of rounds equal to the consumed creature's Hit Dice. The giant also gains this benefit immediately if a swallowed humanoid dies in its stomach.

Impale (Ex) When a mountain giant makes a single attack with a piercing melee weapon (including when using the Vital Strike feat), the weapon attack gains the grab universal monster ability. Any grapple made with such a weapon ends immediately the next time the giant uses the weapon to attack any foe.

Description

When the children of other giants are unruly, their parents warn them to be good or else the mountain giants will eat them. More than mere stories, mountain giants are real beings that lurk in high mountains and deep chasms. Universally carnivorous, the brutal and sadistic mountain giants prefer the flesh of humanoids, giant or otherwise. They especially love the taste of fear, and typically torment and torture victims before consuming them.

The typical mountain giant stands a towering 45 feet tall and weighs 30,000 pounds.
