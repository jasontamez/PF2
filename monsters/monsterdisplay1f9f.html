Special Abilities

Behead (Ex) A skull ripper is an expert at collecting its favorite
trophies'skulls. Once it has pinned a foe, it can attempt to
behead the victim with a single gut-wrenching rip of its claws.
This attempt is made as part of the grapple check to maintain an
existing pin, and if successful, deals 4d6+18 points of damage to
the victim. If this damage is enough to bring the target below 0
hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save to
resist having its head torn from its body, which results in instant
death for most creatures. The save DC is Strength-based.


Dread Visage (Su) All creatures within 30 feet that can see a
skull ripper must make a DC 18 Will save at the start
of their turn in order to avoid becoming
frightened for 1 round. If the victim
recognizes any of the heads
affixed to the skull ripper's
body as having once belonged
to friends or allies, that victim
takes a -4 penalty on the save.
A creature that succeeds at the
save is immune to the dread visage
of that particular skull ripper for 24
hours. This is a mind-affecting fear
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.


Poison (Su) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for
6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save
DC is Constitution-based.


Description

Skull rippers were once guardians of the dead, the grim
custodians of the great ossuaries of Thassilon. Although
most skull rippers are discovered in ancient tombs
and sepulchers, occasionally a geological upheaval or
massive flood destroys a given catacomb or leaves a skull
ripper stranded. In these cases, the construct emerges
and ventures forth into the world above, harvesting
skulls and causing widespread panic as it searches for a
new tomb to guard.

Construction


A skull ripper is made from the carcasses of dead
vermin and skulls, either harvested by the creator or
purchased from shady adventurers for roughly 500 gp
in total.
