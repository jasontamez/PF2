The cytillesh zombies presented here use a hybrid monster template that is easy to duplicate. The base creature gains the fast zombie template presented on page 289 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. It also gains +4 Turn Resistance and Cytillesh Symbiosis (see the Cytillesh Zombie stat block). The cytillesh zombie template increases a zombie's challenge rating by 1. In the context of this adventure, this template can only be added to a creature suffering the effects of exposure to cytillesh fungus that imbibes concentrated cytillesh with caphorite and lazurite granules (see area B12).
