Special Abilities

Crystal Burst (Su) A Vault Keeper's crystal burst deal 12d6 points of damage.

Crystallization (Su) A creature struck by a Vault Keeper's claw must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Dexterity drain. On a critical hit, a target that fails its save instead takes 4 points of Dexterity drain. This ability otherwise functions as the Vault Builder version.

Item Mastery (Ex) A Vault Keeper can always activate spell trigger and spell completion items as if the spell were on its class list.

Item Shaper (Ex) For the purposes of crafting magic items or constructs, a Vault Keeper is treated as though it had all item creation feats.

Description

Xiomorns comprise two castes: the four-legged mythic <a href="mythicmonsterdisplay1bac.html?ItemName=Vault%20Builder">Vault Builders</a> and the two-legged non-mythic <a href="monsterdisplay60fe.html?ItemName=Vault%20Keeper">Vault Keepers</a>. Both are among the most ancient forms of life-primeval elemental beings who travel to raw, new worlds upon the Material Plane, pursuing strange ecological investigations into the nature of life. The worlds these enigmatic beings have visited feature strange ruins in remote regions and immense, vault-like caverns deep underground where ecologies that shouldn't exist flourish. Xiomorns have little interest in protecting a world's indigenous life, except as necessary for their experiments' goals, and wage war against such races when native empires encroach upon the xiomorns' experimental realms.
