Special Abilities

Acid Spit (Ex) A hive warrior can spray acid as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 20 feet. Creatures struck by this spray take acid damage as if struck by a hive creature's death throes. Additionally, creatures damaged by a hive warrior's acid spit continue to take the same amount of acid damage for the next 1d3 rounds. A successful Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates the ongoing damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

Rending Mandibles (Ex) When a hive warrior confirms a critical hit with its bite, it deals equal damage to the creature's armor.

Description

Hive warriors guard colonies and serve as scouts for suitable hosts. Warriors sometimes range miles from their colony and drag victims back to be cocooned by hive workers. Hive warriors consider symbiosis with a hive creature to be both inevitable and beneficial and can't fathom why most victims struggle against it. Hive workers have similar statistics, though they have the ability to secrete resin and sculpt that resin, rather than acid spit or rending mandibles.

The hive are an invasive species of aberrations that consume worlds like locusts. Hive creatures have the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Immunity to acid.</li> <li>Blind: A hive creature is blind. It is immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. Unlike other aberrations, a hive creature doesn't have darkvision.</li> <li>Blindsense 60 feet.</li> <li>Blindsight 10 feet.</li> <li>Corrosive Blood (Ex): A hive creature's blood is highly caustic. Every time the hive creature is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes acid damage according to the table below (or double damage if the attack is a critical hit). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the hive creature has the swallow whole ability, it adds this damage to its swallow whole damage.</li><li>Death Throes (Ex): When a hive creature dies, it exudes a pool of its corrosive blood in the space it occupies. This pool deals 1d6 points of acid damage per Hit Die of the hive creature for 3 rounds to objects and creatures in those squares (Reflex half ). This acid damages whatever surface it is on, and if it deals enough damage to destroy the surface, the acid falls down to any subsequent floor below and continues to deal damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</li> <li>Heat Adaptability (Ex): Hive creatures are considered to always be under the effect of endure elements with regard to hot climates.</li> <li>Hive Mind (Ex): Hive creatures have no language of their own, instead communicating simple concepts via pheromone discharge and body language that other creatures with the hive subtype understand. This ability functions within line of sight. If one hive creature is able to act in the surprise round of combat, all other hive creatures in line of sight can also act, and a hive creature isn't flanked unless all hive creatures within line of sight are flanked.</li> <li>A hive creature doesn't need to eat, drink, or sleep.</li></ul>
