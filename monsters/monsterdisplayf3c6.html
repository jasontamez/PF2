Special Abilities

Glide (Ex) Though it cannot fly, a kakapo can spread its wings midfall to glide safely to the ground without taking damage. For every 10 feet it falls, a kakapo can move 5 feet horizontally in midair. For instance, a kakapo falling a vertical distance of 20 feet can move 10 feet horizontally.

Description

The kakapo is a small, flightless parrot native to tropical islands. Primarily nocturnal creatures, the birds come out at night to forage for fruits, nuts, plants, and seeds. Kakapos can live to be over 100 years old, breeding only two or three times per decade.

A kakapo is roughly 2 feet long from beak to tail tip and can weigh up to 9 pounds.
