Acquired/Inherited Template Both

Wizards in ancient Thassilon each specialized in one of seven schools of magic, a practice that carried over to their production of magical constructs.

"Runeplated construct" is an acquired or inherited template that can be added to any creature with the construct type (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A runeplated construct retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR + 1.

Defensive Abilities: A runeplated construct retains all the defenses of the base creature and gains the following defensive ability.

Opposition School Resistance (Su): A runeplated construct gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities from the schools of magic to which its school is opposed (see Runeplated Construct Traits below).

Special Attacks: A runeplated construct retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains the following special attack.

Infused Attack (Su): By drawing upon the magical energy of the school that created it, a runeplated construct can add additional effects or damage to its melee attacks (see Runeplated Construct Traits below). The save DC against these abilities is 10 + half the construct's CR + the construct's Strength modifier.

Special Qualities: A runeplated construct retains all the special qualities and abilities of the base creature and gains the following special quality.

Runeplated (Su): A runeplated construct cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, even those granted to the base creature, from schools opposed to the one in which it is runeplated. If the base creature has spells or spell-like abilities from the school in which it is runeplated, its gains one additional use of each such ability during the normal frequency period (3/day becomes 4/day, for example).


Runeplated Construct Traits

A runeplated construct gains additional traits based on the school of Thassilonian sin magic used to enhance it.

Envy (Abjuration): Envyplated constructs gain the following attack.

Envy-Infused Attack (Su): An envyplated construct's melee attacks are infused with abjuration magic that disrupts and suppresses the protective magic of its foe. Once per round as a free action upon hitting an opponent, an envyplated construct can lower the total deflection bonus (if any) of that foe by 2 (Reflex negates). Multiple applications of this ability stack until the target's deflection bonus is reduced to 0. If the target has deflection bonuses from multiple sources, the highest bonus is lowered first. This ability does not render magical items nonmagical, nor does it end spell durations. After 1 minute, the effect ends and the deflection bonuses return to normal.

Opposition Schools: Evocation and necromancy.

Gluttony (Necromancy): Gluttonyplated constructs gain the following attack.

Gluttony-Infused Attack (Su): A gluttonyplated construct can infuse its melee attacks with necromantic energy that steals the target's life force, adding it to the golem's own. Once per round as a free action upon hitting an opponent with a melee attack, a gluttonyplated construct can impose 1 temporary negative level on that foe (Fortitude negates).

Opposition Schools: Abjuration and enchantment.

Greed (Transmutation): Greedplated constructs gain the following attack.

Greed-Infused Attack (Su): A greedplated construct can infuse its melee attacks with transmutation magic. As a free action once per round upon hitting an opponent with a melee attack, it can polymorph that opponent into a tiny animal for 1d3 rounds, as per the <a href="spelldisplaycb83.html?ItemName=baleful%20polymorph">baleful polymorph</a> spell (Fortitude negates). Unlike for the spell, however, none of the changes are permanent, and the target returns to its normal form and mind at the end of the duration.

Opposition Schools: Enchantment and illusion.

Lust (Enchantment): Lustplated constructs gain the following attack.

Lust-Infused Attack (Su): Able to lower inhibitions and willpower with a mere touch, a lustplated construct can infuse its melee attacks with enchantment magic. Once per round as a free action upon hitting an opponent with a melee attack, a lustplated construct can deal 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (Will negates).

Opposition Schools: Necromancy and transmutation.

Pride (Illusion): Prideplated constructs gain the following attack.

Pride-Infused Attack (Su): A prideplated construct can infuse its melee attacks with illusion magic. Once per round as a free action upon hitting an opponent, a prideplated construct can cause the target to become fascinated for 1d4+1 rounds as it is surrounded by interwoven, scintillating colors (Will negates).

Opposition Schools: Conjuration and transmutation.

Sloth (Conjuration): Slothplated constructs gain the following attack.

Sloth-Infused Attack (Su): A slothplated construct can infuse its melee attacks with conjuration magic. Once per round as a free action upon hitting an opponent, a slothplated construct can cause that opponent, along with all its worn and held gear, to instantaneously teleport to any other available, visible space of the construct's choosing within 100 feet (Will negates). Opponents thus teleported cannot be sent into the ground or into the air, and if the arrival area is dangerous (on fire, for instance), the opponent gains a +4 bonus on the saving throw to resist the effect.

Opposition Schools: Evocation and illusion.

Wrath (Evocation): Wrathplated constructs gain the following attack.

Wrath-Infused Attack (Su): A wrathplated construct can infuse its melee attacks with evocation magic. Melee attacks made by a wrathplated construct deal an additional 2d6 points of fire or electricity damage (no save). The type of energy damage is chosen when the construct becomes runeplated and can't be changed.

Opposition Schools: Abjuration and conjuration.
