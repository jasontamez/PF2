Shining Child of Thassilon - Monsters







Shining Child of Thassilon

This creature is almost too bright to gaze upon, its emaciated body sheathed in writhing flames of pure light and supporting a prehensile tail, clawed hands, and a twisted skull projecting beams of fire from its eyes and mouth.

Special Abilities

Aura of Blinding Light (Ex) A shining child can radiate a 50-foot-radius aura of blinding light as a free action. This creates a condition of illumination equal to daylight and imposes a -4 circumstance penalty on Hide checks within the aura. Creatures within the affected area must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or be blinded. A creature who successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same shining child's aura for 24 hours. Other shining children are immune to the aura. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Burning Touch (Su) A shining child corrupts the positive energy within a living creature into an unnatural, disintegrating, burning light. By making a successful touch attack, it can cause a living foe to burst into this searing radiance. The light of a shining child deals 2d12 points of fire damage when it first hits and 2d6 points of fire damage for the next 5 rounds. The burning light can be "extinguished" by immersing it in darkness, such as that created by darkness or similar spell or simply by entering an area devoid of any other source of light. This attack does not affect constructs, undead, or similar non-living creatures.

Radiant Armor (Su) The light that surrounds a shining child grants a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. The bonus can be reduced to +2 for 1 round by casting deeper darkness on the shining child (ordinary darkness has no effect).

Searing Ray (Su) A shining child's primary attack is a ray of searing positive energy. This attack has a range of 120 feet (no range increment). This ray deals double damage to undead.

Description

Always obscured by harsh rays of blinding light, the true appearance of the shining children is difficult to discern- and this is just as well, as many creatures find their warped geometry, weirdly glowing eyes and mouth, and pulsating, many-hued skin painful to behold. Those who risk blindness and gaze into the luminous figure describe the general form of the shining child as humanoid, though it seems to have a prehensile tail, and its hands resemble a horrible mixture of fingers and claws, with five pairs of claws and double thumbs on each hand. Its face is difficult to see, as its eyes and mouth constantly exude beams of light in whatever direction the child is looking. These strange beings warp positive energy into powerful searing flames. Everything they touch catches fire and burns into dust, forever lifeless.

Shining children can communicate via telepathy with any creature that has a language. This generally manifests as a constant psychic roar like that of metal tearing or a raging fire, but when they seek to make their thoughts known their voices are strained and raspy.
