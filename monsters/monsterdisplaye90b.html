Mask Golem - Monsters







Golem, Mask Golem

This creature is made of hundreds of metal masks, welded together to form a roughly humanoid body. The masks are mostly iron, but some-such as the hands, knees, and feet- are made of silver lined with gold. The mask that makes up its head is made of porcelain with gold trim and has a large sapphire set into its brow. At the creature moves, the masks seem to shift and stare.

Special Abilities

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A mask golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.<ul><li>A shatter spell deals 4d6 points of damage (no save).</li><li>A grease spell prevents the mask golem from using its masks of control ability for the duration of the spell (no save). Masks that are already in place are unaffected.</li><li>A make whole spell heals the golem as normal and automatically restores one of its masks of control if any have been destroyed.</li><li>Any magical attack against a mask golem that deals sonic damage affects the mask golem normally.</li></ul>Masks of Control (Su) As a standard action, a mask golem can force one of its masks onto a humanoid opponent's face. This ability has a range of 30 feet. Attaching a mask in this way requires a successful combat maneuver check and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once in place, the mask has one of two effects.

Obedience: The target must make a DC 13 Will save each round or fall under the mask golem's control for 1 round. This functions as dominate person. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Solitude: The target cannot speak, breathe, or hear while the mask is in place.

The mask can be removed with a successful combat maneuver check against the mask golem's CMD. The mask can also be destroyed, but half of any damage dealt is made to the target instead of the mask. The mask has Hardness 5 and 5 hit points. A mask golem has a number of masks equal to its Hit Dice (usually 4). If removed from a victim, the mask returns to the golem immediately and can be used again. Destroyed masks are replenished at the rate of 1 per day.

Swarm Form (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a mask golem can assume the form of a swarm of masks. While in this form, it gains the swarm subtype, a fly speed of 60 feet (average), a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and the distraction quality (DC 12). Anyone who takes damage from the swarm attack can also be attacked with one of the golem's masks of control as a free action (assuming the golem has enough masks available). The swarm is made up of Tiny creatures, but does not gain any additional damage reduction. A mask golem can maintain this form for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Any damage dealt to the swarm is subtracted from the golem's hit points, as normal.

Description

Made up of hundreds of masks, a mask golem is a construct forged by the faithful of Razmir to honor the Living God. These constructs are often placed in their temples or other locations that they wish to protect, such as treasure vaults or private sanctuaries for powerful priests. They spend much of their time completely immobile, only coming to life when their instructions force them to take action. Many acolytes are unaware of their true nature, having spent years viewing them as simple statues.

Mask golems can understand Common, but they cannot speak. While they possess intelligence, they are bound by the orders of their creators and are seldom given free reign when assigned to a task. Rarely, these golems are employed as assassins, sent out to punish or kill those that threaten the church.

While all of the masks that make up the golem's body are copies of the holy symbol of Razmir, they are made of different materials. Most are simple iron, but the masks around the joints are made of silver with gold trim, and the head is made from a specially crafted porcelain mask, set with a sapphire. When a mask golem is destroyed, these valuable masks remain, and are worth 1,000 gp in total. The sapphire is worth 500 gp. A mask golem stands 5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

Construction

A mask golem's body is made from hundreds of iron masks, as well as a few that are plated in silver and trimmed with gold, worth a total of 2,000 gp. In addition, the crafter must place a sapphire worth 500 gp into the golem's forehead to complete its creation.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They stand apart from other constructs in the nature of their animating force-golems are granted their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the will of the golem's creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of another, but the golem's creator can always resume control by commanding the golem to obey him alone.


Constructing a Golem

The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components used in its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the materials required and the total cost for its creation.

Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. Building a golem with the advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.


Shield Guardians

A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the golem's construction-a completed golem cannot later be "upgraded" to function as a shield guardian.

Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so). If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.

Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base golem, but with the following additional special qualities. A shield guardian's CR is equal to the base golem's CR + 2.

Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of its amulet is within 30 feet.

Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.

Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can locate the amulet's wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.

Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.

Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).

Construction: A shield guardian's base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem's cost. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem's kind. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time-it costs 20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian's total cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. The creator must have a minimum caster level of 2 higher than the base golem's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells are added to the base golem's requirements: discern location and either shield or shield other.
