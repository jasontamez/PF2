Special Abilities

Mass Erasure (Su) As a full-round action, a psychemental can
move up to its speed and attack each creature whose space
it passes through with its mindwipe ability. A target can
make an attack of opportunity against the psychemental or
forgo its attack of opportunity to instead attempt a DC 19
Reflex save to evade the psychemental. A psychemental can
affect each target only once per round, no matter how many
times its movement takes it through a target creature's
space, and it can't end its move inside a creature. The save
DC is Dexterity-based.

Mindwipe (Su) A psychemental can erase a portion of the
mind and experiences of a creature it touches, affecting the
creature as mindwipe (CL 11th, Will DC 18 negates). Each
successful mindwipe heals the psychemental of 10 points
of damage. It gains any healing in excess of its maximum
hit points as temporary hit points for 1 hour, though
such temporary hit points do not stack. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

Description

As part of the fallout of a major
supernatural phenomenon or
mentally disturbing event, the
collective unconscious of
a population of psychic
beings can give rise to a
self-aware intellect
that's known as
a psychemental.
These emergent
phenomena form on
the Astral Plane, where
they appear in the form
of amorphous fields
made up of fluctuating
colors, shapes, and even
faces that ref lect their
evolving thoughts and
new perceptions as they
attempt to come to terms with their new state of being.

While these inquisitive, unpredictable creatures are not
inherently evil, they do temporarily absorb fragments of
others' minds in order to heal themselves. And though
psychementals seek out interactions with intelligent
creatures for the pleasures of learning about the world
and socializing, an encounter with one can be a dangerous
affair if it feels threatened or provoked. Unfortunately,
this occurs fairly often, as the upsetting stimuli that
prompted a psychemental's creation leave it more easily
startled than other creatures. A psychemental's attacks are
never lethal on their own-the stolen mental fragments
eventually reform themselves within the victim's mind
over time-but the potential to leave a victim comatose
for an extended period of time can be quite dangerous
in its own right. Yet sentient beings who approach a
psychemental calmly and without any ill intent find the
creatures to be extremely engaging conversationalists,
and psychementals' very natures guarantee that they
are experts in a variety of esoteric topics. A creature that
manages to make a psychemental feel safe may have just
earned a highly unusual friend for life.
