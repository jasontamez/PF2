Special Abilities

Arcane Hooks (Ex) A master automaton's hooks are treated as having the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch</a> property and as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A master automaton applies twice its Strength as a bonus on damage rolls with its hooks. When a master automaton hits with a hook, it can attempt a reposition combat maneuver as a free action. With a successful combat maneuver check, the master automaton can move its target to any square within its reach. If both hook attacks hit the target, the master automaton gains a +5 bonus on the combat maneuver check.

Automaton Sense (Ex) A master automaton can sense and locate other automatons within 500 feet as if it had blindsense, and it can detect automatons within 60 feet as if it had blindsight.

Consume Core (Ex) A master automaton can consume the life energy found within an automaton core as a standard action. Consuming a core in this manner destroys the automaton core and grants the master a +1 bonus to natural armor and on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 24 hours. Consuming a second automaton core within this 24 hour period causes the bonuses to become permanent. A master automaton can never gain more than a +10 bonus by consuming automaton cores. If a master automaton consumes the automaton core of another master automaton, it gains that master automaton's permanent bonuses gained by the consume core ability, if any, and add these bonuses to its own permanent bonuses.

Energy Beam (Ex) A master automaton can focus the energy in its core to fire either a 90-foot line or a 60-foot cone of energy as a standard action. The beam deals 20d6 points of damage to each creature caught in the area (Reflex DC 30 half). Half of the damage is fire damage and half is force damage. A master automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d3 rounds. A master automaton can use its energy beam when it is grappling or being grappled. The save DC is Wisdom-based.

Powerful Core (Ex) A master automaton's automaton core is filled with extremely potent life energy, granting the master an insight bonus to AC and on saving throws equal to the master automaton's Charisma bonus (if any). Additionally, this energy grants the master automaton a number of bonus hit points per Hit Die equal to its Charisma bonus (if any).

Reconstruction (Ex) A master automaton is able to reconstruct itself if its body is destroyed. The master automaton's automaton core uses its energy to rebuild the automaton's body over the span of 1d10 days. If the core is located in Axis, the reconstruction requires only 1d10 hours. Once reconstructed, the master automaton reactivates with full hit points and any bonuses it had gained from the consume core ability. Only destroying a master automaton's automaton core prevents this reconstruction.

Description

Master automatons are the most powerful among their kind. The highest-ranking leaders of the Artificer Conclave reserved these frames for themselves, intent on using their power to keep the rest of the automatons, and the other masters, in check. Most master automatons did not enter combat, instead choosing to serve as strategists and advisors.

While every master automaton is customized to serve the needs of the Conclave, they all command the same basic abilities. Most notable is their ability to detect and destroy automaton cores, an ability developed in case it became necessary to stop rogue automatons. Each master's frame is created with an arcane resonance that matches that found in automaton cores, allowing a master automaton to destroy and consume a core with ease. An unexpected side effect of this destruction process, however, is that a master absorbs the destroyed core's energy, which empowers the master.

This knowledge soon led to an arms race among the masters as they sought more automatons that they deemed as deserving of destruction. A large number of automatons were destroyed and consumed before this arms race eventually reached a deadlock, when the masters intentionally destroyed the means of creating new automaton cores in an attempt to cut off their rivals. This marked the end of the Artificer Conclave, and the masters soon went into hiding.

Today, the masters hide among the planes, mostly in especially remote or dangerous areas. Very few masters remain on Golarion. These masters resurface only when they find leads on a large collection of automaton cores or a particularly powerful automaton, biding their time until the perfect moment to strike. A few masters did not fall prey to avarice, though, and instead serve as advisors to particularly powerful beings, such as great rulers or powerful mages, hoping to steer them away from Jistka's past mistakes. Others still continue their search for knowledge, exploring the multiverse at their leisure to collect new knowledge and meet new personalities. Of particular note is the master automaton Anquira, who makes it very public that she is on a quest to speak with the other masters in the hopes of piecing together the lost knowledge of automaton creation to help restore the automatons to their original forms.



Automaton Council

The highest members of the Artificer Conclave were some of the most powerful scholars and warriors of the Jistka Imperium. This high-ranking group was known as the Automaton Council. The council is made up of some of the first automatons, having developed the technology that allowed their creation. Each member of the council was transplanted into a personalized master automaton with abilities far beyond those of the rest of the Conclave. The council vanished shortly before the coming of the Night Plague in -3064 AR, but their names and titles remain, burned into every automaton core as a signature from a fragment of their own life energy.

Automatons are lawful neutral constructs with the extraplanar subtype. An automaton has the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry). <ul><li>Darkvision 120 feet and low-light vision. </li><li>Immunity to electricity. </li><li>Resistance to cold 10 and sonic 10. </li><li>Most automatons are resistant to magic. Such an automaton has SR equal to 11 + its CR. </li><li>Telepathy. </li><li>An automaton is proficient with its natural weapons, all simple weapons, and all weapons mentioned in its entry. </li><li>An automaton's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>Automaton Core (Ex): All automatons are powered by a planar core infused with life energy. A destroyed automaton leaves behind an <a href="magicartifactsdisplay9b74.html?ItemName=Automaton%20Core">automaton core</a>, which can be harvested with a successful Spellcraft check. </li><li>Intelligent Construct (Ex): Automatons are intelligent constructs and can take class levels, can gain feats, and can gain class skills and additional skill points. An automaton gains a number of skill points equal to 4 + its Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) per Hit Die. The following are class skills for automatons: Climb, Craft, Diplomacy, Fly, Intimidate, Knowledge (all), Perception, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Stealth, and Use Magic Device. </li><li>Vulnerable Mind (Ex): Automatons are not immune to mind-affecting effects.</li></ul>

Automaton Cores

Although the bodies of automatons are wonders in and of themselves, the true technological marvels they bear are the <a href="magicartifactsdisplay9b74.html?ItemName=Automaton%20Core">automaton cores</a> that power these constructs. The secret to the creation of automaton cores has since been lost to time, but each core contains a spark of consciousness from a particular individual, combined with a significant portion of planar energy. These two components are merged using powerful magical energy to form a core of seemingly limitless arcane potential that powers an automaton. This energy courses throughout an automaton's body, powering the construct and completing an internal connection that allows the individual automaton's consciousness to remain active.

Powering an automaton with a core other than its original core can cause a conflict with the consciousness stored within the body. The two different individuals may engage in a mental struggle as each attempts to wrest control of the body from the other. This usually leads to one individual consciousness overpowering the other, but it occasionally creates a new, shared consciousness wherein the two individuals meld to form a single new entity with shared memories.

Removing an automaton core from a destroyed or willing automaton is a laborious and risky process that requires a number of hours equal to half the automaton's CR. After this time, the remover must attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 + the automaton's CR. On a success, the automaton core is removed and can be used normally. On a failed check, the removal attempt is unsuccessful and cannot be attempted again for 24 hours. Failing this check by more than 5 causes damage to the core and reduces its total number of spell points by 1. Returning a core to an inactive automaton's body to restore the creature requires another Spellcraft check with the same DC. If the consciousness in the body and the core are incompatible or unwilling to meld, the two attempt an opposed Charisma check. The winner of the opposed roll takes over as the dominant consciousness, but it may find itself opposed again later.
