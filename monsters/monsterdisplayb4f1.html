Special Abilities

Bountiful Fruits (Ex) Once per week, a flowering lattice produces a handful of small fruits or berries that remain ripe for 1 week. Eating all of the fruit takes 1 minute and affects the eater as if she had consumed a berry affected by goodberry.

Pollen (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a flowering lattice can expel a cloud of pollen in a 10-foot cone. Creatures in the area are dazzled for 2 rounds (Fortitude DC 11 negates). If a creature currently dazzled by the pollen is affected again, it is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 11 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

Description

The result of centuries of plant husbandry, flowering lattices are delicate networks of vines that form blossoming nets about 1 square foot in size. As many as 12 varieties of flower grow from an individual flowering lattice, with each bloom opening at different times of the year and hours of the day to ensure a nearly constant array of colorful petals. This plant's enthusiasts often incorporate the organism into their fashion, draping them over the shoulders like a stole or over the head as a hood. These lattices require regular care, surviving on their own only in regions with rich soil and ample pollinators.
