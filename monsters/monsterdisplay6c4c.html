Special Abilities

Photophores (Ex) Once per day as a standard action while underwater, the vampire squid can release a 15-foot cone of disorienting bioluminescent mucus from its photophores, illuminating the area with dim light. A creature within this shimmering cloud of blue light must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be dazzled for as long as it remains in the cloud and for 1 round thereafter. The cloud persists for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Pressure Adaptation (Ex) A vampire squid takes no pressure damage from changes in water depth.

Tentacles (Ex) A vampire squid's tentacles all strike as a single primary attack but only to grapple.

Description

The vampire squid-so called for its red eyes and cloak-like webbing-is a cephalopod from the lightless depths of the oceans. This eerie mollusk is covered in photophores, which it can use to create a defensive barrage of light when agitated.

A vampire squid can reach a total body length of up to 1 foot and weighs 1 pound.
