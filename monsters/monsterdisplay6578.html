Special Abilities

Encage (Ex) When a tarantula tree uses its freeze ability, it appears as a grove of trees with a tangled, shared canopy. Since the tarantula tree is Colossal, Large or smaller creatures can move through its space with ease, and the tarantula tree can move through a square occupied by a Large or smaller creature with ease. The tarantula tree never provokes attacks of opportunity from Large or smaller creatures as a result of such movement. As a swift action, a tarantula tree can extend thick, thorny branches from the sides of its trunk-like legs, forming a cage of sorts that functions as a wall of thorns (CL 17th) for the purposes of creatures attempting to move into or out of the tarantula tree's space. While using its encage ability, a tarantula tree cannot move, but gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures in its space. It can retract these vines and resume its normal mobility as a move action.

Vines (Ex) A tarantula tree's thorn-laced vines are a primary natural attack that deals bludgeoning and piercing damage

Description

Terrifying predators, tarantula trees claim dominion over vast swaths of territory. Within these regions, they tend to be nomadic until they find a productive hunting spot. While they cannot speak, these plants are quite intelligent and have been known to live in peace with creatures willing to engage them in entertaining conversation.

The typical tarantula tree stands upward of 100 feet in height and weighs nearly 200 tons.
