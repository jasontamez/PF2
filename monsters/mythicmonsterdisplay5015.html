Special Abilities

Choking Ash (Su) Any creature that starts its turn in the giant's aura is nauseated for 1 round (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The ash provides the giant with 50% concealment against ranged attacks. Strong wind or fire-quenching magic disperse it for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Fire Vortex (Su) A mythic fire giant can expend one use of mythic power to create a vortex of fire within 30 feet. The vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, 15 feet wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. Any creature starting its turn adjacent to the vortex takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and any creature passing through it takes 15d6 fire damage. A successful DC 23 Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The fire giant can move the vortex up to 20 feet as a move action. If the vortex moves through a creature, that creature must succeed at a saving throw against the vortex to avoid taking damage. The vortex lasts for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Lava Weapons (Su) All melee and ranged attacks made by the fire giant deal an additional 4d6 points of fire damage. This ability replaces the heated rock ability of non-mythic fire giants.

Description

A mythic fire giant burns like the heart of a volcano. Wielding weapons of flame and ash, it brands enemies with its fury and strength.
