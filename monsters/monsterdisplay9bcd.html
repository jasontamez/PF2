Special Abilities

Tongue (Ex) A giant frog's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times the frog's normal reach (15 feet for a Medium giant frog). A giant frog's tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab. A giant frog does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.

Giant frogs have razor-sharp teeth lining their mouths. They are 6 feet long and weigh 200 pounds.
