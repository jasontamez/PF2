Miengu - Monsters







Miengu

The features of this lithe, glistening female are placid yet severe. Her firmly carved body is transparent and ripples like living water, ever flowing and reforming like a river come to life. Four arms sprout from her shapely form, while from the waist down her limbs join into a twisting column of living liquid. Her gaze is wary, and around her float twirling blades, seemingly created from razor-sharp water.

Special Abilities

Amphibious (Ex) Miengus can breathe both air and water, although they rarely travel more than a few feet from water.

Aqueous Armament (Su) Miengus can form and shape the water around them-condensed from the atmosphere or even drawn from their own fluid bodies if needed-into any simple or martial melee weapon. These weapons are made of pure water, magically solidified to the hardness of steel, and they function like +1 magical weapons of the appropriate type. Miengus typically use this ability to craft spears, though they might form other weapons as they please.

In addition, on any round a miengu can manifest 1d4+1 water daggers and make ranged attacks with each. Each of these weapons is treated as a +1 dagger and dissolves after being thrown. The number of daggers a miengu creates and can thus attack with changes from round to round.

Fluid Form (Su) While a miengu appears humanoid, its interior is entirely comprised of water. Miengus have all the immunities of elementals. A miengu may also flow through tiny gaps and cracks as if in gaseous form and can move through spaces occupied by other creatures without difficulty, although they provoke attacks of opportunity as normal.

Freedom of Movement (Sp) Miengus are constantly under the effects of freedom of movement (caster level 12th).

Oasis Kiss (Su) As a full-round action, a miengu can deliver a life-giving kiss to any living corporeal creature. The oasis kiss removes fatigue, nausea, sickness, and exhaustion, and the recipient gains the benefits of an endure elements spell for 24 hours. This ability is usable 3 times per day.

Water Tongue (Su) Miengus can converse with any creature with the aquatic or water subtypes as if using speak with animals or tongues.

Waverider (Su) As a full-round action once every 1d4 rounds, a miengu can summon an arcing column of water and use it to propel herself across the battlefield. When using this ability, a miengu moves in a straight line between 30 and 60 feet. If the miengu cannot move this far, this ability fails. Any creatures of Medium size or smaller in the fey's path must make a DC 20 Reflex save or take 1d6+6 points of damage and be knocked prone. Creatures who succeed take only half damage and are not knocked down. Those in the fey's path may not make attacks of opportunity when it moves in this fashion. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Miengus are water spirits who typically dwell in desert oases, jungle rivers, and along tropical coasts. They consider themselves the protectors and healers of the weak and innocent, among whom they count peaceful fey, pools of pure water, serene vistas, natural gardens, and even the smallest of animals and flowers. They combat destructive races like ogres, goblins, and sahuagin wherever they encounter them, waging private crusades against their predations. Some claim lush oases, hidden coves, or reefs of particular beauty as their personal territories, guarding them viciously against any they perceive as interlopers.

A typical miengu stands approximately 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs several hundred pounds, their bodies consisting primarily of water.
