Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) A creature that successfully saves against the hag's breath weapon takes half damage and is not blinded.

Ice Staff (Su) Once per week, a winter hag can perform an hour-long ritual to create a staff made of black ice that is as hard as steel and functions as a +2 frost quarterstaff. A winter hag holding her ice staff can use cone of cold once per day as a spell-like ability. The staff melts after 1 week.

Icewalking (Ex) This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the hag climbs must be icy. The hag can move across icy surfaces without penalty and doesn't need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.

Snow Vision (Ex) A winter hag can see perfectly well in snowy conditions and doesn't take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.

Description

Winter hags are sadistic crones who haunt winter-blasted plains and rime-covered forests. They're exceptionally arrogant, and often use their magic to subjugate entire tribes of evil humanoids so they can rule over them as queens. These arrangements rarely last more than a few seasons, because no creature is truly safe from a winter hag's irrepressible appetite for warm, raw flesh. An ambitious winter hag might extort a village by causing constant snowfall until they give her children to eat or adults to become her slaves.

A typical winter hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.

When a winter hag joins a coven, the coven adds sculpt simulacrum and simulacrum to its spell-like abilities, and any member within 1 mile of the winter hag gains icewalking and snow vision.

Customizing Hag Covens

Any group of three hags can form a coven, but realistically, many types of hags will never cross paths or deign to work with one another. Blood hags are loath to form covens that are not under their control. Annis hags are likewise domineering, rarely working with more powerful hags. Storm hags usually prefer allying with other storm hags, but they will occasionally form covens with green hags or sea hags. Sea hags sometimes seek out a green hag to lead them. Mute hags-among the most powerful of mortal hags-relish the destruction of relationships, and their involvement in a coven is typically transient, lasting only as long as whatever barrier prompted them to seek sisters in the first place. Night hags and dreamthief hags are outsiders that wander the planes in search of victims. These cautious schemers do not hesitate to involve mortal hags in their machinations, readily joining covens when it proves expedient. Their immortality grants them great patience and enough time to plan contingencies so that betraying them becomes a risky proposition.

A typical hag coven can cast the spells listed in the green hag's monster entry (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 167). Blood hags, storm hags, and winter hags always grant the spells and abilities listed in their bestiary entries. To reflect the diversity of powers hags can invoke, Game Masters can customize the spell lists of covens based on their membership; each type of hag makes specific spells available to cast as coven magic.

All covens can cast the following spells, regardless of the hags that comprise them: <a href="spelldisplayc394.html?ItemName=Animate%20Dead">animate dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayedf1.html?ItemName=Baleful%20Polymorph">baleful polymorph</a>, <a href="spelldisplay4414.html?ItemName=Bestow%20Curse">bestow curse</a>, <a href="spelldisplay3517.html?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance">clairaudience/clairvoyance</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya33d.html?ItemName=Commune">commune</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf711.html?ItemName=Dream">dream</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya816.html?ItemName=Forcecage">forcecage</a>, <a href="spelldisplay218d.html?ItemName=Mind%20Blank">mind blank</a>, <a href="spelldisplay7555.html?ItemName=Reincarnate">reincarnate</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya200.html?ItemName=Speak%20with%20Dead">speak with dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplay1ac4.html?ItemName=Veil">veil</a>, <a href="spelldisplay42e8.html?ItemName=Vision">vision</a>

If dryads, nymphs, and sprites represent the grace and beauty of unspoiled nature, then surely the annis hag, green hag, and sea hag embody its savage, destructive side. Though not fey themselves, hags appear to be somehow tied to nature, even if no more than as a distorted reflection of it. Hags are foul, wicked creatures, warped with cruelty and evil. Uniformly female and invariably repulsive, these misshapen crones plot dark deeds over bubbling cauldrons, either singly or in sinister triads known as covens.
