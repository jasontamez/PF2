Tactics

Before Combat The elder casts longstrider on herself, and bear's endurance, bull's strength, and magic vestment and on allies who will enter combat. She chooses one vulnerable ally to protect with shield other.
During Combat The elder focuses on healing her allies and counteracting her enemies' spells while staying out of harm's way. If the group needs to escape, she assists the evacuation by casting teleport (if a small number of allies are with her) or wall of stone (if a large number of ratfolk are with her).
Base Statistics Without longstrider, the elder's statistics are Speed 30 ft.

Description

Since ratfolk have short lifespans, they heed the wisdom of those who attain old age. Many ratfolk aspire to become elders from a very young age, and try to get their hands on books and histories when they go into trade, intending to later study them. Often, aspiring leaders pursue the healing arts to keep the rest of the warren healthy-and to ensure they live long enough to pass on their knowledge.
