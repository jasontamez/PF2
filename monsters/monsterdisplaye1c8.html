Menotherian - Monsters







Menotherian

This bear-sized creature looks like a gangly black wasp. Its wings are large and delicate, and fine hairs cover its joints and feet. Its front-most legs end in graceful articulate hands, and its jagged abdomen terminates in a wicked pair of stingers as long as a man's arm. Though its alien face has no human-like expression, intelligence gleams in its eyes.

Special Abilities

Alluring Scent (Ex) The Menotherian constantly exudes intoxicating pheromones that cause creatures in her vicinity to grow relaxed and react favorably toward her. Any creature within 30 feet of her must make a DC 26 Fortitude save or adjust its attitude one step closer to friendly; the creature makes a save on the first round of exposure and every minute thereafter. Creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on their saving throws. The Menotherian prefers to let this ability take effect before trying to negotiate with others, though it works even in combat (in long-term battles, opponents have been known to ask to parlay with her after sufficient exposure). A creature ceases to attack her once its attitude shifts away from hostile (but if she attacks it again, its attitude resets to hostile). This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Alternate Form (Su) The Menotherian can change into her elf-like form or back again at will as a move-equivalent action. In her elf form she cannot use her natural attacks, implant swarms, or mind control, but can still use her spell-like abilities and alluring scent. She can also take the form of a giant wasp or a normal wasp, though she normally only uses these shapes as disguises rather than for battle.

Implant Swarm (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, the Menotherian can use her stinger to implant a cluster of eggs in a target. The affected creature must make a DC 26 Fort save to avoid implantation; this DC is Constitution-based. The eggs gestate in 2d4 rounds, during which the target is nauseated. When the gestation period ends, the eggs hatch into a chaotic neutral hellwasp swarm with a hive mind. The swarm swiftly consumes the victim's innards, killing the host immediately, then inhabits and animates the body as a zombie-like creature. A remove disease spell rids a victim of the eggs during the gestation period, as does a DC 30 Heal check made as a fullround action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Mind Control (Su) The Menotherian can inject a concentrated form of its alluring scent directly into the brain of a helpless or willing humanoid creature. If the creature fails a DC 26 Fortitude save, the herald can control the target for the next 24 hours as if using dominate person, though the Menotherian must verbally give the target instructions.

Poison (Su) Injury, Fortitude DC 26, initial damage 2d6 Dex, secondary damage 1d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

The Menotherian is a personification of lust, vengeance, and trickery. She is the chief immortal agent of Calistria in the mortal world-bereft of morals, she seduces, tricks, or murders any creature necessary to complete her mission. In her true form she is a great wasp-like creature weighing just over 1,400 pounds. Though she can fly, her wings create a loud buzzing noise audible from over 500 feet away, so when she must be stealthy she walks or climbs. The Menotherian needs no armor, for her exoskeleton is as hard as adamantine. She observes her environment with an alien detachment, missing no detail but only acting when she feels the time is right.

When subtlety is necessary, she can take the shape of an exotic elf of either gender, a giant wasp, or a normal wasp. Her humanoid form is almost a caricature of elven beauty, with long ears, narrow cheekbones, and long graceful limbs-if elves look more elven than half-elves, the Menotherian looks even more elven than true elves, as if elves are near-perfect mortal copies of the "true" elven ideal. In this form she lacks most of her combat ability, but can still seduce with her wits and good looks, or even use her pheromones on reluctant targets. The Book of Joy refers to hundreds of transparent, sealed chambers in Calistria's palace, each containing a sleeping creature resembling the Menotherian's elven form; the goddess awakens one of these any time she needs a new herald or wants to create another one of her succubus-like avengers.
