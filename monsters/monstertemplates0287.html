Chief among the allies of Baba Yaga and the White Witches of Irrisen are the winter-touched, a special breed of fey immune to the harsh weather and low temperatures of the frozen north. Willingly pledging themselves to a wholly evil life, these creatures undergo a complex ritual called the Winter Rite, in which they accept a sliver of ice into their hearts that infuses their bodies with the same supernatural winter perpetuated by the White Witches of Irrisen. The resulting transformation gives the fey's skin a sickly bluish cast marked with spidery white veins like hoarfrost on glass. These evil fey can channel the power of winter into their attacks, slowing their victims with numbing cold. The winter-touched universally delight in spreading the influence of the White Witches, carrying out the wills of the witches who performed their Winter Rites. The winter-touched display a chilling loyalty that borders on fanaticism-a devotion all but guaranteed given the White Witches' ability to fatally pierce the hearts of those who fail them with the same slivers of ice the fey so willingly accepted.




Winter-Touched Fey

The winter-touched fey simple template can be applied to any creature of the fey type. This template cannot be applied to a creature with the fire subtype. A winter-touched fey's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: The creature's alignment changes to evil and it gains the cold subtype; Special Attacks: Numbing Cold (Su) Any creature hit by a winter-touched creature's attacks (natural or weapon) must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.
