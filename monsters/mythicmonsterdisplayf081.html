Sent down by vengeful deities to punish communities that have offended them, plague swarms scour crops, terrorize populations, and lay waste to civilized lands. Normal means of dealing with vermin and pestilence don't drive them off, for these vicious and intelligent mythic swarms carry the destructive blessings of their gods, and breed at an exceptional rate until their spawn consume entire cities. They are single-minded in their devotion to carrying out the furious will of their deities.

All plague swarms have the following features.

Ecology

Environment any
Organization solitary or brood (plague swarm plus 1-100 spawn)
Treasure none

Special Abilities

Blight (Su) Plague swarms deal additional untyped damage equal to their standard swarm damage. This damage originates from divine power, similar to the spell <a href="spelldisplay58a3.html?ItemName=flame%20strike">flame strike</a>. A plague swarm's damage counts as magic and epic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.

Multiply (Ex) Plague swarms spawn at an incredible rate. Once per minute, a plague swarm can produce a new swarm of the type listed in its stat block as full-round action. When the plague swarm is not in combat, it typically uses this ability once per minute. If the plague swarm is destroyed, all of the swarms that it spawned also disperse.

Reform (Su) When a plague swarm is dispersed by damage, it is not destroyed. A dispersed plague swarm reforms in 24 hours. Each plague swarm has a unique destruction condition. In addition, because plague swarms are manifestations of divine retribution, placating the deity's rage destroys the swarm instantly.

Special Abilities

Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid creature who dies
from a bat plague swarm's soul bleed
ability rises from death as a vampire
in 1d4 days. This vampire is
under the command of
the swarm, and remains
enslaved until the swarm
is destroyed. The swarm
can have enslaved spawn
whose Hit Dice total no
more than twice its own;
any spawn it creates that
would exceed this limit
become free-willed undead.
Profane Protection (Su) A
bat plague swarm gains a +2
profane bonus to its Armor
Class from its divine creator.
Reform (Su) A bat plague
swarm is truly destroyed only if it is
dispersed in the area of a hallow spell.
Soul Bleed (Su) A creature that takes damage from
a bat plague swarm begins to bleed from its body and its
soul. Each round, a creature under the effects of soul bleed
takes 1d4 points of Constitution bleed damage and gains
1 negative level. A creature affected by soul bleed can't
be healed by magical healing from a non-mythic source.
A mythic caster can attempt a DC 24 caster level check to
heal a creature under the effects of soul bleed. If the caster
succeeds, the soul bleed ends. Otherwise, any creature can
end a soul bleed effect with a successful DC 35 Heal check.
Twenty-four hours after a creature takes negative levels from
soul bleed, it must attempt a separate DC 26 Fortitude save
for each negative level. If it succeeds at a save, that negative
level is removed. If it fails, that negative level becomes
permanent. The save DC is Constitution-based.
