Special Abilities

Tail Lash (Ex) The diplodocus prefers to attack with its tail. The dinosaur can snap its incredibly long tail with surprising speed like an enormous whip-this is a primary attack that deals bludgeoning and slashing damage. A diplodocus can make two separate attacks with its tail lash as a full-attack action.

Description

The diplodocus is one of the longest dinosaurs, capable of reaching lengths of 100 feet or more. Much of this length is taken up by the diplodocus's tremendously powerful whiplike tail, a devastating weapon capable of striking at a considerable range.
