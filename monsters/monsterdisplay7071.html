Special Abilities

Regrowth (Ex) A sea crawler regrows a lost tentacle as per regenerate after 1 week. This does not heal or remove any conditions from the sea crawler.

Remarkable Grip (Ex) When a creature breaks free of a sea crawler's grapple, the sea crawler remains in an adjacent square as if still grappling its prey, even if the creature moves. The sea crawler can attempt to grapple as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity if it remains attached to a creature at the start of its turn. A creature can remove the sea crawler as a move action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. A sea crawler can detach itself as a free action.

Description

With arms reminiscent of a sea star or an octopus and the bodies of lemurs, sea crawlers range all over Azlant's coasts. Sea crawlers sometimes eat fruit, but most prefer meat, lying in shallow waters and ambushing prey. A sea crawler is 5 feet long and weighs 70 pounds.
