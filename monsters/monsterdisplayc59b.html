Special Abilities

Ink Cloud (Ex) A squid can emit a 5-foot-radius cloud of ink once per minute as a free action while underwater. This cloud provides total concealment. The ink persists for 1 minute.

Jet (Ex) A squid can jet in a straight line as a full-round action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

Description

Squids are aggressive predators that fear little and are more than willing to attack prey larger than themselves.
