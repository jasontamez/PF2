Tactics

Before Combat The ogre king casts greater magic weapon and magic vestment on his weapon and armor respectively, and activates his iron skin revelation.

During Combat The ogre king relies on buffing spells, his quickened spells, and his combat healing to bolster his combat abilities and keep himself in prime shape. If faced with archers or spellcasters, he casts wall of stone or quickened obscuring mist to prevent anyone from obtaining line of sight while he engages melee combatants.

Base Statistics Without the benefits of greater magic weapon, iron skin, and magic vestment, the ogre kings statistics are AC 25, no damage reduction; Melee +1 falchion +20/+15/+10 (2d6+10/15-20).

Description

Few ogres live long enough to amass great power-which makes an army commanded by a powerful ogre king or queen a terrifying force to behold.

This lumbering giant's beady eyes are devoid of wit or kindness, and its puffy face features a wide mouth with ill-fitting teeth.
