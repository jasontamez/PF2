Special Abilities

Angry Glow (Su) Once per minute, as a full-round action,
the sprites that make up a sprite swarm may coordinate
their luminous abilities to create a singular, searing glow.
Creatures within 10 feet of a sprite swarm with line of sight
must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be blinded for
1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is dazzled for
1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.


Concentrated Rush (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, if more than
one creature occupies a sprite swarm's space, the swarm
may use its attack action to concentrate on one of these
creatures to deal 4d6 points of damage in place of its normal
swarm damage. Other creatures within the horde's space do
not take swarm damage that round.


Mob Mentality (Ex) As long as a sprite swarm has at least
10 hit points, it retains its Intelligence score and can act
accordingly. Even so, it cannot be targeted by mind-affecting
spells or effects that target a single creature. If its hit points
fall below 10, the swarm is considered mindless as the
individual creatures within begin to panic.


Description

When intruders threaten their beloved homes, sprite
guards in large villages are taught to call for their fellow
tribe members to form a vicious, enveloping swarm to
drive back their enemies. Typically consisting of at least
5,000 sprites, these swarms are known for inflicting pain
upon any creatures in their paths. Sprite swarms typically
form only when the sprites' village is threatened by a large
number of intruders or a single powerful foe; however,
the malevolent sprites of Geb are quick to form swarms
when faced with intrusion of any kind.



In some parts of Golarion where sprites are
known to exist, those accused of crimes or other
unacceptable behavior are sentenced to face a sprite swarm
so that nature itself can judge them. If a sprite swarm
forms to drive one of the accused away, he is guilty; if
not, he is innocent. Most of those sent forth never return,
having run afoul of the sprites' protective instincts, but
occasionally the sprites allow someone they deem not a
threat to live-quite independently of their actual guilt
or innocence.
