When animals are stricken with demon plague, they may arise as undead and further spread the disease. Some demons and cultists are fond of using plagued horses as mounts.

"Plagued beast" is an acquired template that can be added to a living, corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A plagued beast uses all of the creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR + 1.

Alignment: Neutral evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). It retains all subtypes except alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind. Do not recalculate its saves, BAB, or skill ranks.

Armor Class: Increase the base creature's AC by 2.

Hit Dice: Change all of the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. As undead, plagued beasts use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points.

Defensive Abilities: Plagued beasts gain darkvision 60 feet, channel resistance +2, and DR 5/slashing. They are immune to cold, and gain all of the standard undead traits.

Melee: A plagued beast gains a bite attack that deals damage based on the plagued beast's size. If the beast already has a bite attack, the bite's damage increases by one step, as if it had increased one size category.

Special Attacks: A plagued beast inflicts demon plague with each successful bite attack (DC = 10 + 1/2 the plagued beast's Hit Dice + the plagued beast's Charisma modifier).

Ability Scores: +4 Strength, +2 Dexterity. A plagued beast has a minimum Charisma score of 15-if the base creature's Charisma score is lower, increase it to 15. A plagued beast has no Constitution score; as an undead, it uses its Charisma when calculating its hit points, Fortitude saves, and any special abilities that rely on Constitution.

Feats: A plagued beast gains <a href="featdisplay1698.html?ItemName=Toughness">Toughness</a> as a bonus feat.
