Boar, Bristle Boar

The vicious spines surrounding this boar's head are almost as unnerving as the wild look in its eyes.

Special Abilities

Spines (Ex) Targets of a bristle boar's successful gore attack must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw to avoid being speared by the dangerously sharp spines around its head and neck. Failure results in 1d4 points of piercing damage as well as 1 point of bleed damage per round for 3 rounds. Bleed damage from multiple spines doesn't stack, but the duration is reset by subsequent attacks. Magical healing or a successful DC 15 Heal check ends the bleed effect. The save DC is Strength-based.

Description

Bristle boars are native to the plains and low hills of Belkzen, and are well-known threats to trackers and scouts familiar with the area. The long, hollow spines surrounding their heads are reminiscent of porcupine spines, and make these boars deadlier than their common cousins. Bristle boars are quite lean and aren't considered particularly good to eat-but a desperate adventurer faced with starvation could survive on the meat if necessary.

A typical bristle boar stands roughly 4 feet off the ground and weighs 200 pounds.

Much more ill-tempered and dangerous than their domesticated kin, boars are omnivorous creatures common to temperate forests, although they are not unknown in tropical climes. Other variants exist as well, such as the particularly ugly warthogs that dwell in tropical plains and savannahs. Boars are often hunted for their flesh, which is considered delicious by most humanoids. Those who hunt boars often do so with a special spear fitted with a cross beam to prevent an impaled boar from pushing forward along the spear shaft to gore its tormentor.

The boar's stubborn nature and habit of eating even bones makes it well suited as a pet for certain folk. Many thieves' guilds keep boars for the disposal of bodies, while orc tribes let them run loose in their lairs, where they do a relatively good job at keeping these warrens clean of refuse.

A boar is four feet long and weighs 200 pounds.
