A creature with the calcified template is preserved by the toxic fluids pumped into its body by an incutilis lord. Though the creature's identity is lost and its life soon fades, the incutilis lord retains use of the creature's feats, physical skills, extraordinary abilities, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. This template can be applied to any living corporeal creature.

Rebuild Rules: Senses darkvision 60 ft.; AC increase natural armor by 4; Immune mind-affecting effects; Ability Scores +4 Str and Con. A calcified creature has no Intelligence score, but can use its physical skills as directed by the incutilis lord that created it and does not lose any skill ranks. Skills: +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks in dim or no light.
