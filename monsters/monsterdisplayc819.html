Special Abilities

Breath of the Void (Su) A nimbral child's breath weapon is a blast of howling, frigid winds drawn from the void. A nimbral child cannot use this ability while it is within an area of bright light. A creature that fails its saving throw against the nimbral child's breath weapon is slowed (as per the <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> spell) for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Dark Nimbus (Su) Shadows swirl around a nimbral child, granting it concealment from attacks and a deflection bonus to its Armor Class equal to its Charisma modifier.

Penumbral Web (Su) Eight times per day as a standard action, a nimbral child can project gray, shadowy webs as per the <a href="umr2bbb.html?ItemName=Web">web</a> universal monster rule. In addition to being subject to the webs' entangling effect, any creature not native to the Shadow Plane touching a penumbral web takes 1d6 points of Strength damage and is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 21 to halve the damage and negate the paralysis). A nimbral child can also create sheets of penumbral webbing. These sheets do not burn but can be pushed aside, although touching them affects a target as per a successful penumbral web attack. If a nimbral child is destroyed, all penumbral webs it has created dissolve in 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

Powerful practitioners of shadow magic sometimes summon these kin of the enigmatic <a href="monsterdisplaya26c.html?ItemName=Shining%20Child">shining children</a> for their own nefarious purposes, but never without risk.
