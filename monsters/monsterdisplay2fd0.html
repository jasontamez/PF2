Special Abilities

Mold Symbiosis (Ex) A moldwretch forms bonds with mold hazards by spending time within their areas of effect. A moldwretch can bond with only one mold at a time, and the symbiotic bond forms only after the moldwretch spends 8 hours in contact with the hazard. A moldwretch is immune to fungal hazards. Three example mold symbiosis effects are detailed below.

Brown Mold: The moldwretch is immune to fire, and fire-based attacks restore a number of hit points to it equal to half the damage the attacks would normally deal. Its spores deal 2d6 points of cold damage.

Russet Mold: The moldwretch's spores expose targets to the effects of russet mold (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 273).

Yellow Mold: The moldwretch's spores expose targets to the effects of yellow mold (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 416).

Spores (Ex) A moldwretch's tentacle and spore launch attacks expose their targets to the creature's spores, which have an effect linked to the moldwretch's mold symbiosis. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save negates the additional effect of a moldwretch's spores. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

While they are usually reclusive and aren't actively malevolent, moldwretches often come into conflict with adventurers who clear away patches of mold during dungeon exploration. They get along well with vegepygmies, but loathe and fear fungus queens (see page 130). A moldwretch is only 3 feet tall but is very dense and weighs 120 pounds.
