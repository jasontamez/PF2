Description



Giant Dire Boar Mount

Giant dire boar (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 36, 295)
hp 52

Kings and queens direct the movements and strategies of entire armies, but fire giant lieutenants command the rank-and-file soldiers on the battlefield from atop their massive mounts. Fire giant lieutenants are superb tacticians, and they inspire the troops under their command. The lieutenants know that to flee battle is to incur the wrath of their king or queen.

The giant dire boar presented above functions as a mount for the fire giant lieutenant's mount ability.
