An asura has the following traits, unless otherwise noted in the creature's entry. <ul><li>Immunity to curses, disease, and poison. </li><li>Resistance to acid 10 and electricity 10. </li><li>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells. </li><li>Telepathy. </li><li>Elusive Aura (Su) Asuras exist within reality but apart from it. All but the least of asuras exude an aura that affects all creatures within the area as if by a <a href="spelldisplay32e1-2.html?ItemName=nondetection">nondetection</a> spell. The size of the aura is proportional to the asura's power. The caster level check to attempt divination on creatures within the aura is 15 + the spell-like ability caster level of the asura creating the aura. </li><li>Regeneration (Ex) The divine spark at the core of their being allows asuras to regenerate at varying rates. Good weapons and spells can kill an asura. </li><li>Spell Resistance (Ex) Most asuras are resistant to magic and have an SR equal to 11 + their CR. Only the weakest asuras lack this ability. </li><li>Summon (Sp) Asuras share the ability to summon others of their kind, typically another of their type or a small number of weaker asuras. </li><li>An asura's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </li><li>+6 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks and a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li></ul>
