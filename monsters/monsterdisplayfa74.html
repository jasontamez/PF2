Description

Just as domovoi protect the home, dvorovoi protect villagers' yards and pastures. Intrigued by tales of the creatures' guardianship, some farmers lure dvorovoi to their fields by leaving offerings of bread, sheep's wool, or shiny trinkets. When the owner of a farmstead with a dvorovoi purchases a new animal, he leads it through the yard to introduce it to the dvorovoi, hoping to gain the fey creature's approval of the new livestock.

Though undeniably useful to have around for feeding the cattle and keeping predators away from flocks, dvorovoi can be capricious. Dvorovoi despise any white animal, and will never tolerate a white-furred horse or cow in their presence. For unknown reasons, dvorovoi don't hold this same grudge toward white chickens.

These sometimes-helpful fey creatures bind themselves to rural families and live among them. Some bear a resemblance to the family's ancestors, a similarity that grows more obvious the longer they are in the family's service. House spirits use their compression ability and invisibility to stay out of the sight of those they live among.
