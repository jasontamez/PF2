Special Abilities

Harmony with the Land (Su) A basavan is at peace in its natural habitat, and the terrain reveals its secrets to the basavan. A basavan in forest terrain gains the <a href="umrc252.html?ItemName=Greensight">greensight</a> universal monster rule with a range of 60 feet. When in hill or mountain terrain, the basavan gains tremorsense with a range of 60 feet.

Wilderness Walker (Su) A basavan instinctively knows the easiest and fastest way through any wilderness, and always treats trackless terrain as though it were a trail or road, and any terrain with a road or trail as though it were a <a href="rules8d48.html?Name=Overland%20Movement&amp;Category=Movement">highway</a>. In addition, Knowledge (nature) is a class skill for basavans.

Description

Covered in shaggy hair that envelops the entirety of their immense bodies other than their faces, basavans resemble exceptionally hirsute giants. Wise and peaceful stewards of the wilderness, basavans protect the plants and animals that share their homes in wooded mountains across Golarion. Basavans are likely to let unwitting trespassers off with a warning, but against predators and poachers they deal powerful blows with staves and stones, using their innate connection to the land to locate and trap their foes.

Basavans are 24 feet tall and weigh 17,000 pounds.

Ecology

Basavans are reclusive creatures who spend their whole lives in isolated mountain valleys or ranging through hillside forests. The few aware of the existence of basavans-normally druids and other wilderness protectors-know them to be staunch defenders of the wilderness, yet none agree on where and when basavans originated. The basavans themselves claim to be as old as the forests but not quite as old as the mountains, but they deliver this information with a merry twinkle in their eyes. Basavans bear children only rarely, and in such seclusion that young basavans are virtually never seen by anyone other than their parents until they mature and join them in protecting their lands. Young basavans, born entirely hairless and with skin that resembles thick bark, appear very different from their parents. They grow their hair quickly as they age, but shed all of it twice in their youth. A basavan's hair is usually dark brown, but might be black, tawny, or even deep auburn. Basavans consider their hair useful for warmth and in their daily work, such as to make crude twine or as nesting material for animals, but they rarely take care of it and therefore have a shaggy, wild appearance.

A basavan designates a wide strip of primeval forest or mountains as its personal protected domain; often, this area is dozens or hundreds of square miles in size. A basavan usually keeps intruders out of its lands personally, although a few that share a border with hermits, trappers, or shepherds teach these hardy folk how to identify and repel intruders as well. Basavans tend to injured plants and animals in their personal domains, creating a lush bounty and safe haven for animals.

Basavans are herbivores, and most subsist on only a small meal every few days. Despite their limited diet, basavans are incredibly massive, with powerful muscles and robust constitutions. They are remarkably athletic, able to scale cliffs and swim across rough rivers with ease. Basavans bring a focused efficiency to even the most physically demanding labor, but they take care to avoid disturbing vegetation or upsetting wildlife even when traveling quickly across their terrain.

Basavans are skilled smiths, and most devote their lives to a single type of craft, such as working with iron, stone, or wood. Although they generally don't maintain lairs, as they prefer to sleep in the wild, they often hollow out caves to use as a forges or workshops, expanding their caves as they age. Basavans use the simple tools they create in their stewardship of the land or as gifts to nearby peaceful communities.

These hardy creatures age very slowly and generally live to be 600 or 700 years old. Elderly basavans become true masters of the crafts they pursue.

Habitat and Society

Although basavans are reclusive, a rare few of these hairy giants venture out into communities near their protected lands. Such basavans sometimes consider nearby shepherds, farmers, or settlers to be under their protection, and they might help rebuild a home destroyed by a flood or round up livestock lost in a storm. Although basavans almost never hunt or kill animals, they don't mind when humanoids under their protection do. They enjoy imparting ancient secrets of farming or animal husbandry to such neighbors, encouraging a deeper respect for the local environment. These communities might engineer a system to summon their guardian basavan in the event of a raid, natural disaster, or other serious need; such warning systems often consist of bells, whistles, or bright flags. A basavan withholds its protection and training from those who demonstrate a wanton disregard for the land, such as by being reckless with fire or butchering animals for sport. These actions provoke the normally peaceful creatures into a rage, causing them to exile or even kill the offenders.

Basavans rarely gather in large groups, and some might go their entire lives without seeing more than a handful of others of their kind. When they do gather in small groups, such as families, basavans work together in an eerie unison that hints at some deep mutual communion. In these groups, males defer to females for protection, as the females tend to be larger and stronger, but in other matters the basavans tend to defer to the oldest among them.

Because of the old lore basavans keep, many sages, druids, and explorers seek them out in order to gain their knowledge. Visitors must be prepared with a deep well of patience and work for days or weeks to prove they have at least rudimentary skill in woodcraft or caring for animals. During this time, even if the basavan doesn't show itself to the visitor, it is watchful for any slip that might reveal anything other than benevolent intentions toward the natural world. Once a visitor proves herself, however, the basavan is a gracious host and eager to share its guidance. Some basavans display a sly wit in these conversations, making lighthearted jokes at their visitors' expense.
