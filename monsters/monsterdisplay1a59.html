Special Abilities

Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the onkushu. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level 15th). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in the statistics above.

Wing Buffet (Ex) Three times per day as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, an onkushu can buffet its mighty, flaming wings to create a whirlwind of searing hot air that is 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide, and travels in a straight line for 30 feet. Any creatures in the whirlwind's area take 5d6 points of fire damage and 5d6 points of slashing damage and are knocked prone (Reflex DC 21 halves the damage and negates being knocked prone.) Additionally, if the onkushu creates the whirlwind while standing on the ground, the burning detritus the whirlwind leaves behind causes the area of the whirlwind's path to become difficult terrain for 15 rounds.

Description

Curious natives of the Plane of Fire, onkushus have managed to keep fruitful and respectful relations with the angels of the Outer Sphere for millennia. Thanks to this alliance, the angels of Elysium, Heaven, and Nirvana have passed on much of their lore as well as some of their more practical skills to the onkushus. In turn, onkushus instruct the angels further in the use of cleansing fire and the virtues of an existence based on unshakable morality. Onkushus are kindly by nature but terrible when roused, and their alien appearance often strikes fear into those fools who would oppose them.

Onkushus are typically 15 feet tall and weigh up to 1,000 pounds.
