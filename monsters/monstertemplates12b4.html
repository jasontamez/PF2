Followers of Urgathoa revere all sicknesses as worldly expressions of her divine will, but none more so than the pallid gift, which opens its victims' fevered minds to the glory of the Pallid Princess. Creatures that die while afflicted with the disease rise as undead, but some creatures form a symbiotic bond with it and become pallid vectors.

"Pallid vector" is an acquired template that can be added to a corporeal, living creature not immune to disease. A pallid vector retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted.

CR: Base creature's CR + 2.

Alignment: Any evil.

Armor Class: The creature's natural armor bonus increases by 3.

Defensive Abilities: A pallid vector is treated as undead for the purposes of negative and positive energy, and it gains immunity to disease, exhaustion, fatigue, poison, and stunning. Additionally, it gains the following ability.

Pale Rebirth (Su): When a pallid vector dies, it rises as a plague zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 289) 1 round later. Instead of zombie rot, it spreads pallid gift (see Disease below). Sprinkling holy water on the body (a standard action) before it rises prevents this. A humanoid pallid vector that kills itself ritualistically or dies within a desecrate effect or other area that promotes undeath rises as a more powerful undead instead, as if it had died from pallid gift (see table below).

Special Attacks: A pallid vector gains stench (Bestiary 304; 10 rounds) and disease. The DCs are Constitution-based.

Disease (Su): All of a pallid vector's melee attacks, even with manufactured weapons, carry the pallid gift disease. Pallid Gift: melee attacks; save Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 the pallid vector's Hit Dice + its Con modifier; >onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Constitution damage and 1d6 Wisdom damage, the infected creature is fatigued, the ability damage can't be healed, and the fatigue can't be removed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. A nonhumanoid infected creature that dies rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours, and spreads pallid curse instead of zombie rot. A humanoid infected creature that dies rises as an undead according to its HD. <table class="inner"><tr><td>Hit Dice</td><td>Monster</td></tr> <tr><td>1-3</td><td>Plague zombie</td></tr> <tr><td>4-5</td><td>Ghast</td></tr> <tr><td>6-7</td><td>Wight</td></tr> <tr><td>8+</td><td>Vampire</td></tr></table>
