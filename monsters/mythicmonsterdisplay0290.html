Special Abilities

Blazing Mane (Su) When in an area of normal or brighter light, the grogrisant's golden mane blazes like the sun. Creatures more than 60 feet away treat the beast as having total concealment due to the dazzling brilliance, and any creature within 60 feet that looks at the grogrisant must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. Creatures can avert their eyes as if this were a gaze attack.

Powerful Bite (Ex) The grogrisant's bite attack applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.

Shimmering Coat (Su) The grogrisant adds its natural armor bonus to its touch AC.

Description

Tales of Taldor's earliest founding speak of a terrible beast-a gigantic six-eyed lion whose mane burned like the sun and whose footsteps shook the earth-that laid waste to the desperate city-states of the region, feeding on their livestock and plundering their wealth to line its den. Called the grogrisant, it terrorized the region for centuries until First Emperor Taldaris finally slew the terrible beast.

Sometimes called the Imperial Beast, the grogrisant has reappeared occasionally throughout Taldor's history, always in times of great peril and always to eventually be slain by a hero of the people-but only after slaughtering many more who would lay claim to that title. No one is certain if the grogrisant is part of a rare race of mythical leonine beasts that hide within the World's Edge Mountains or if it is simply a lone beast that refuses to die; mythic magic conceals its tracks and hides it from divinations, leaving its life and lair a mystery.

The grogrisant's pelt amplifies sunlight, creating a deadly blaze of light that burns out the eyes of those nearby and renders the beast nothing but a barely perceptible shimmer to distant creatures. Taldan folklore insists the beast's blood can cure any disease.

The grogrisant stands 18 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 12,000 pounds.
