Special Abilities

Aura of Destruction (Su) A genthodaemon can create an
aura of pure carnage. All critical threats made against
targets within the aura (including the genthodaemon)
are automatically confirmed. Dying creatures within
the aura take a -10 penalty on stabilization checks. The
genthodaemon can activate or suppress this aura as a
free action.


Barbed Defense (Su) A creature that strikes a genthodaemon
with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural
weapon takes 1d4+4 points of piercing damage from the
barbed wire and other pieces of jagged metal embedded in
the genthodaemon's body. Melee weapons with reach do
not endanger their users in this way.


Penetrating Slivers (Ex) When a genthodaemon confirms a
critical hit with a claw attack, pieces of its metal nails break
off and enter the target's body, working their way toward its
heart. When the slivers reach the heart 1d3 rounds later, the
creature takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The slivers
are destroyed by anything that removes curses, diseases,
or death effects. Likewise, creatures immune to curses,
diseases, and death effects are immune to this ability.


Shrapnel (Ex) A genthodaemon can shake loose four large pieces
of the shrapnel embedded in its body as a standard action
(make a separate attack roll for each piece). This attack has a
range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets of this
attack must be within 30 feet of each other. The daemon can
launch at most 24 pieces of shrapnel in any 24-hour period.


Description

Genthodaemons are common troops of daemonic armies,
resolutely obedient to any greater type of daemon that
gives them orders. They personify death in hopeless or
futile wars, genocide, and the despair created by long,
bloody stalemates where the combatants lose their will
to live and forget why they were fighting in the first
place. They have almost no role in corrupting mortals,
as they are devoid of interest in the fates of most other
creatures, but are sometimes called by daemonologists
or greater daemons for use in war or their ability to
shape battlefields. Any daemon that can summon a
ceustodaemon can instead use its summon ability to
summon a genthodaemon.


A genthodaemon looks like a stereotypical fiend-
basically humanoid, but with claws, a tail, batlike wings,
and cloven hooves. Metal armored plates, barbs, and spikes
cover its body, though these are part of the daemon rather
than armor it wears. Its claws are jagged metal shards
sprouting from its fingers where nails should be.


Genthodaemons are only slightly above cacodaemons
and lacridaemons in the hierarchy of Abaddon. A greater
daemon may create a genthodaemon from a cacodaemon
or one of the hunted (a dead soul trying to survive on
Abaddon); however, most arise naturally from war-battered
souls who band together as hunted, transforming into true
daemons simultaneously when the group has cannibalized
enough souls. Genthodaemons show unusual loyalty to
others in their band, though this doesn't interfere with
their obligations to more powerful daemons.


A typical genthodaemon stands over 9 feet tall and
weighs 500 to 600 pounds (with much of this weight
stemming from the daemon's embedded metal).

Ecology


Souls that become genthodaemons usually come from
worlds where war technology has advanced to allow
production of large amounts of metal armor and
weapons-particularly worlds where firearms have been
invented. When battle grows so such a scope that the
enemy becomes a faceless tide, or killing becomes casual
and easy at long range, the act of waging war becomes
completely dehumanized and soldiers become mere pieces
in a perpetual machine. In such grim instances and the
seeds are planted to send soldiers' souls to Abaddon.


These ties to the craft of war stain the dead soul and
the daemon created from it, manifesting as armor plates
fused with daemonic flesh, pieces of weapons embedded
in its bones, or even remnants of siege engines or barbed
wire sprouting from or wrapped around the daemon's
body. These elements are part of the daemon, not mere
decorations, but any mechanical pieces merely resemble
functional items and no longer work (for example, a
daemon with a crossbow or rif le embedded in its arm
cannot shoot it). Genthodaemons from the same band
often resemble each other, including the shape of their
metal parts, sometimes because their mortal selves were
even in the same army and uniform.


Though genthodaemons serve in the armies of all
four Horsemen, they are most strongly associated
with Szuriel, the Horseman of War. Her military
background, strong discipline, and focus on the
brutality of war resonates with the core of a
genthodaemon's being. Those who (as mortals)
were involved in acts of genocide have a morbid
fascination with obscisidaemons and tend
to follow them. Though genthodaemons
were not the instigators of genocide
in their mortal lives (which could
have granted them higher status on
Abaddon), those who participated in
such acts feel a fawning admiration for
the greater daemons who orchestrated
such atrocities.


Like other daemons, genthodaemons
hate all living things-and to an extent,
themselves-and look forward to the
death of the last mortal, for on that day
they will have no other reminders of
their bleak mortal lives and can focus all
their hate inward.

Habitat and Society


Genthodaemons patrol the fortresses,
cities, ruins, and wastelands of Abaddon
looking for invaders, hostile non-daemons,
and gangs of the hunted. Because they usually
travel in groups, they are rarely preyed upon by
other creatures and only have to face death when
deployed as part of a Horseman's army. They are of low
status but fulfill a necessary role as soldiers of Abaddon.
Greater daemons treat them with the formal respect due
their relative difference in rank, much like how a general
might treat a common soldier. However, in the wars against
mortal life, the Horsemen understand the value of suicidal
missions and brazen sacrifice, and are not above sending
countless genthodaemons to permanent destruction if
it advances the cause of Abaddon. The genthodaemons
accept this as their lot and never complain, as protests
require effort, will, and the belief that there is a possibility
of change-three things these shell-shocked creatures
lost long ago.


On the Material Plane, genthodaemons sometimes
serve daemonic cults that are unworthy of a greater
daemon's attention or lacking the power to summon a
more powerful creature. As their magic is suitable for war
and destruction, they have limited use to mortal cultists
not intent on violence.

Harbingers of ruin and embodiments of the worst ways to die, daemons epitomize painful death, the all-consuming hunger of evil, and the utter annihilation of life. While demons seek to pervert and destroy in endless unholy rampages, and devils vex and enslave in hopes of corrupting mortals, daemons seek only to consume mortal life itself. While some use brute force to despoil life or prey upon vulnerable souls, others wage campaigns of deceit to draw whole realms into ruin. With each life claimed and each atrocity meted out, daemons spread fear, mistrust, and despair, tarnishing the luster of existence and drawing the planes ever closer to their final, ultimate ruin.


Notorious for their hatred of the living, daemons are the things of dark dreams and fearful tales, as their ultimate ambitions include extinguishing every individual mortal life-and the more violent or terrible the end, the better. Their methods vary wildly, typically differentiated by daemonic breed. Many seek to infiltrate the mortal plane and sow death by their own taloned hands, while others manipulate agents (both mortal and immortal) as malevolent puppet masters, instigating calamities on massive scales from their grim realms. Such diversity of methods causes many planar scholars to misattribute the machinations of daemons to other types of fiends. These often deadly mistakes are further propagated by daemons' frequent dealings with and manipulation of other outsiders. Yet in all cases, despair, ruin, and death, spreading like contagion, typify the touch of daemonkind, though such symptoms often prove recognizable only after the hour is far too late.


Daemons flourish upon the plane of Abaddon, a bleak expanse of cold mists, fearful shapes, and hunted souls. Upon these wastes, the souls of evil mortals flee predation by the native fiends, and terror and the powers of the evil plane eventually transform the most ruthless into daemons themselves. Amid these scarred wastelands, poison swamps, and realms of endless night rise the foul domains of the tyrants of daemonkind, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Lords of devastation, these powerful and unique daemons desire slaughter, ruin, and death on a cosmic scale, and drive hordes of their lesser kin to spread terror and sorrow across the planes. Although the Horsemen share a singular goal, their tactics and ambitions vary widely.


Along with mastery over vast realms, the Horsemen are served by unimaginably enormous armies of their lesser brethren, but are obeyed most closely by retinues of daemons enslaved to their titles. These specific strains of daemonic servitors, known among daemonkind as deacons, serve whoever holds the title of Horseman. Although these instruments of the archdaemons differ in strength and ability, their numbers provide their lords with legions capable of near-equal terrorization.


More so than among any other fiendish race, several breeds of daemons lust after souls. While other foul inhabitants of the planes seek the corruption and destruction of living essences, many daemons value possession and control over mortal animas, entrapping and hoarding souls-and in so doing disrupting the natural progression of life and perverting the quintessence of creation to serve their own terrible whims. While not all daemons possess the ability to steal a mortal being's soul and turn it to their use, the lowliest of daemonkind, the maniacal cacodaemons, endlessly seek life essences to consume and imprison. These base daemons enthusiastically serve their more powerful kin, eager for increased opportunities to doom mortal spirits. While cacodaemons place little value upon the souls they imprison, greater daemons eagerly gather them as trophies, fuel for terrible rites, or offerings to curry the favor of their lords. Several breeds of daemons also posses their own notorious abilities to capture mortal spirits or draw upon the power of souls, turning the forces of utter annihilation to their own sinister ends.



The Four Horsemen


Four dread lords, infamous across all the planes, rule the disparate hordes of daemonkind. Risen from among the ranks of their terrible brethren to displace those fiendish tyrants before them, they are the archdaemons, the End Bringers, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. In the blasphemous annals of fiendish lore, they are the prophesied architects of multiversal ruin, destined to stand triumphant over cadaverous cosmoses and infinities of silence before also giving way to absolute oblivion. Undisputed in his power among their kind, each Horseman rules a vast realm upon the bleak plains of Abaddon and a distinctive method of mortal ruin: pestilence, famine, war, or death from old age. Yet while each archdaemon commands measureless influence, daemons know nothing of loyalty and serve only those they cannot overcome. Thus, though the Horsemen stand peerless in their power and manipulations among daemonkind, they must ever defend their thrones from the machinations of ambitious underlings and the plots of other archdaemons.


Upon the poisonous expanses of Abaddon, lesser daemonic peers carve petty fiefdoms and posture as lords, but despite their world-spanning intrigues, all bow before the Horsemen-though most do so only grudgingly. Ancient myths also tell of a mysterious fifth Horseman, the Oinodaemon, though nearly all mention of such a creature has been scoured from the multiverse.
