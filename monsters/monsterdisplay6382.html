Special Abilities

Pain Touch (Ex) A rhu-chalik secretes an enzyme that
coats its tendrils. When this enzyme comes into
contact with a living creature, it causes excruciating
pain. Any creature that comes into contact with the
enzyme must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take a -2
penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks for 1d4
rounds. If a creature is affected by multiple pain touch attacks,
the duration stacks but the penalty doesn't. This is a pain
effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Project Terror (Su) As a standard action, a rhu-chalik can harness
the fears of any creature on which it has successfully used
detect thoughts within the last minute. This effect creates
terrible, nightmarish visions in the target's mind; the target
must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be frightened and take
1d4 points of Wisdom damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Void Transmission (Su) If a creature takes an amount of Wisdom
damage from the rhu-chalik's project terror ability that equals
or exceeds the creature's Wisdom score, the creature falls
unconscious as normal. At that point, the rhu-chalik can take 10
minutes to copy and absorb the creature's entire consciousness
and send that consciousness through the void of space to its
waiting masters. If the creature's Wisdom damage is healed
and the creature is revived prior to the end of this process, this
effect fails. If the creature's Wisdom damage is healed after its
consciousness is successfully transmitted, the creature awakens
disoriented, and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability
checks, and skill checks for 24 hours. This effect otherwise
doesn't harm the target, as the target's consciousness isn't
eliminated, only duplicated and transmitted.

Description

A rhu-chalik, also called a void wanderer, is an alien entity
that scouts through space on behalf of its conquering
masters. In addition, this aberration also collects the
memories of interesting creatures in the universe into
a vast repository of knowledge that their masters use to
slowly unravel all the secrets of existence.

Rhu-chaliks serve their masters tirelessly, and are
as patient as they are long-lived. They rarely make
an uncalculated move, and seek only the most prized
intellects to cast into the dark beyond for their masters-
delectations. When exploring distant worlds, rhu-chaliks
are not social beings, and they avoid other rhu-chaliks so
their predations won't cause too much overlap in the mind
collections of their masters. However, back in their native
space, rhu-chaliks number in the billions, and
the creatures feed off a countless number of
disembodied minds.

A rhu-chalik is approximately 3 feet
across and weighs only
30 pounds.
