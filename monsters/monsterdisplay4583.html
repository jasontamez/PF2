Tactics

Before Combat A spellblade casts defensive shock if it expects battle, often following with displacement and invisibility to pursue a chosen target more freely.
During Combat A spellblade combines arcane power and mental mastery with the deadly, sinuous grace of the blade. It uses its hasted assault ability whenever possible, and uses spell combat and spellstrike whenever it has appropriate spells available. It prefers to weaken opponents with poisoned bites and spells like chill touch, ray of enfeeblement, and vampiric touch.
