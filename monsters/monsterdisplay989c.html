Gravesludge

Special Abilities

Create Spawn (Su) A creature slain by a gravesludge animates as a free-willed juju zombie 1d4 rounds after it is slain.

Haunted (Su) The eldritch spiritual energy that infuses a gravesludge grants it a deflection bonus to its AC and a resistance bonus on Reflex saves equal to its Charisma modifier (+5 for the typical gravesludge).

Lifeleech (Su) When a gravesludge deals negative energy damage to a creature, that creature continues to take 1d6 points of negative energy damage at the start of its turn each round. This effect can be stopped via magical healing, and otherwise stops on its own 3 rounds after the initial slam attack. Multiple slam attacks extend the duration of this ongoing negative energy damage but do not increase the amount of damage.

Swift Slam (Ex) A gravesludge can attack twice with its slam attack as a standard action.

Description

Gravesludges straddle the line between oozes and undead. Primarily made of ectoplasm and grave dirt, gravesludges spontaneously arise in areas where a grave is desecrated, near strong haunt activity, and in the defiled graves of unhallowed cemeteries. Intelligent undead often entreat gravesludges to bolster their defenses, but solitary gravesludges wander cemeteries, charnel houses, and ossuaries, driven by little more than a burning jealousy and hatred for the living. Occasionally, living creatures work with a gravesludge to secure a grisly form of life after death as juju zombies.

The average gravesludge measures 6 feet across and weighs 750 pounds.
