Hadhayosh - Monsters







Hadhayosh

This titanic bull has skin like brass and a mane of flames. It towers over the treetops, stopping periodically to eat from the foliage above. Mighty twisted horns thrust forward from above its massive head. Its hooves are cloven and a powerful tail thrashes about behind it.

Special Abilities

Frightful Charge (Su) A hadhayosh can inspire terror by charging or attacking. A creature charged by a hadhayosh must succeed on a DC 23 Will save or become paralyzed with fear, remaining in that condition as long as they stay within 60 feet of the hadhayosh. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Godforged Horns (Ex) A hadhayosh's horns are treated as silver and cold iron for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

Heat (Ex) A hadhayosh generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. A hadhayosh controls the heat it emits, allowing it to carry riders without harming them.

Rush (Ex) Once per minute, the hadhayhosh can move at a speed of 150 feet.

Stench (Ex) A foul musk clings to a hadhayosh. Living creatures within 100 feet must succeed on a DC 30 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same hadhayosh's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonuses on their saving throws. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Created by a deity of the forge in ancient times, hadhayoshes tower over the lands, symbols of the power of the gods and the fury of the desert. While they look similar to oxen in general shape, these massive beasts have skin like beaten brass and flames that leap from their heads and backs in radiant manes. They are typically docile creatures motivated primarily by the urge to sleep, reproduce, and eat, in that order, though a certain wanderlust afflicts the beasts, causing them to roam over vast territories. When angered, hadhayoshes become ferocious, striking out with rage at any creature that would dare to challenge them. They are not accustomed to lesser creatures causing trouble for them, though they often find themselves prey for other giants such as dragons.

Strangely uniform in size, as if measured to divine specifics, all adult hadhayoshes stand 52 feet tall and weigh exactly 57 tons.

Riding a Hadhayosh

Hadhayoshes are stubborn animals and, under most situations, refuse to allow even the most skilled handler to ride them. However, a suitable display of divine power impresses these creatures, changing their typical attitude of indifferent to helpful. To do this, a cleric or paladin must channel power through his holy symbol great enough to affect a 10 HD undead creature (see the Turning Undead chart on page 159 of the PH). A cleric with the Glory, Fire, Strength, or Sun domain gains a +2 bonus on this check (having multiple domains does not cause the bonus to stack). This show of divine might awes a hadhayosh and convinces it to lower its heat ability. Once so compelled, it will allow the character and up to 11 allies to ride it, though the creature will not attack or otherwise go out of its way to aid its riders.
