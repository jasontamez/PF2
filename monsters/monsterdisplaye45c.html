Sruvara - Monsters







Azi, Sruvara

Hissing poison drips from the many-fanged maw of this monstrous serpent. Its body like that of some gigantic venomous snake, this sinister wyrm-like beast undulates with frightening speed, and two pairs of lean wings rise from the base of a thick neck supporting a powerful, draconic visage.

Sruvara CR 15

Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) A sruvara can spit forth a stream of poison so corrupt it can sear skin and dissolve metal (100- foot line, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 12d8 acid, Reflex DC 26 half ). Any creature damaged by an sruvara's breath must make an additional DC 26 Fortitude save or be poisoned (initial and secondary damage 1d4 Con). This poison is so concentrated that even living creatures normally immune to poison-such as high-level druids and monks, wearers of magic items like a periapt of proof against poison, demons, or other creatures-must still save against this poison. Nonliving creatures like constructs and undead remain immune to this poison.

Additionally, the first creature struck by a sruvara's line of poison that fails its Reflex save takes a concentrated burst of the poison, instantly causing its armor to corrode, completely destroying it. Magic armor must succeed on an additional DC 26 Reflex save to resist being dissolved.

All save DCs are Constitution-based.

Cursed to Corruption (Su) Sruvaras spread the taint of evil wherever they go, and delight in few things more than tarnishing the gleam of true innocence with their corruption. Once every minute, a sruvara can spit a blasphemous curse. The target must make a DC 24 Will save or have an angry blemish rise upon its skin in the form of some foul sigil. This mark is treated in all ways as a foul version of the spell mark of justice, cursing the target to avoid performing some benevolent act the sruvara deems ironic or otherwise fitting. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Noxious Cloud (Su) The greenish tinge on the sruvara's scales is in fact a potent poison (inhaled, Fortitude DC 26, initial 1d6 Wis, secondary 2d6 Wis). As a standard action, a sruvara can violently shake its body, freeing the poison from its scales, causing a noxious, mind-numbing cloud to erupt around its body. This cloud extends 10 feet from the creature and is treated as a poisonous form of obscuring mist that persists for 1d4 rounds. All creatures nearby the azi when it creates the cloud or who end their turn in the cloud are subject to its poison. Creatures who do not breathe are immune. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Poison (Ex) Injury, Fortitude DC 26, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution based.

Description

Though the smallest of the azi, sruvaras rival their brethren in potency. Their sleek build and stealthy manner allows them to stalk prey like the most deft jungle hunters, while their innate cunning and sadism make them blights upon whatever land they choose to despoil. While many azi are arrogant and greedy, sruvara are maniacal and cruel, reveling in the screams of long-tortured victims and the plight of parched villagers forced to choose between watering themselves or their children. One ancient legend told among desert claims the sruvara sprang from the lips of Ahriman himself as he uttered his first curse, a thing of living venom that would poison the world for all time.

A sruvara's scales look like ridges of slate or flat gray metal. Between these scales, an organic olive-colored powder creeps like toxic verdigris. A typical adult sruvara measures 26 feet from the tip of its tapered snout to the toxic tip of its stinger, with most of this length accounted for by its long neck and tail. A sruvara stands 8 feet at the shoulder. Large yet thin, the average sruvara weighs only 2,200 pounds.
