Special Abilities

Cytillesh Symbiosis (Su) The cytillesh fungus infesting the host creature's body acts as the dead flesh's animating force. It grants the creature a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and a poisonous touch. The slam of a cytillesh zombie releases spores that subject the creature to a mild dose of cytillesh poison. The creature must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become dazed for 1d3 rounds as it suffers memory loss of the previous moments. Multiple poisoning effects do not stack, but rather only extend the duration.

Quick Strikes (Ex) Whenever a cytillesh zombie takes a full-attack action, it can make one additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus.
