Special Abilities

Absorb Good Magic (Su) Whenever a spell with the good descriptor includes a devastator as a target or in its area or effect, the caster must succeed at a DC 38 caster level check or the devastator negates the entire spell and gains 5 temporary hit points per spell level of the spell absorbed that last 1 hour.
Aura of Corruption (Su) Any chaotic evil outsider with 15 or more Hit Dice within 60 feet of a devastator gains a +10 enhancement bonus to Strength and Charisma, and its SR increases by 5 (if it doesn't already possess SR, it gains SR equal to 11 + its CR).
Vile Strikes (Ex) All of a devastator's attacks are +5 unholy anarchic weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Description

In an unholy act of twisted, demonic humor, devastators derive their power from the souls of good outsiders.
