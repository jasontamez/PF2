Special Abilities

Danava Mantle (Su) The ornate mantle a danava wears grants
it a +9 deflection bonus to its AC. It functions for other
Colossal mythic creatures in the same way, but not for nonmythic
creatures or those of other sizes.

Devastator (Su) As a full-round action, a danava can make a
single attack at its highest base attack bonus with its tetsubo
or slam attack. This attack counts as a Vital Strike despite not
using an attack action. On a successful hit, this attack bypasses
all damage reduction and hardness. If used to perform a
sunder combat maneuver or to damage an object, the attack
is capable of critical hits (despite objects' usual immunity to
critical hits) and is automatically treated as a critical threat.

Iron Resilience (Ex) Once per round, a danava can completely
ignore an attack (whether it required an attack roll, was
a targeted spell, or was an area attack, and regardless of
whether it would cause damage or not). A danava can expend
one use of mythic power to ignore an additional attack
beyond the first in the same round; this ability uses no action
and can be activated so long as the danava has mythic power
remaining. The danava can choose to use this ability after the
result of any attack roll, caster level check to overcome spell
resistance, saving throw, or other pertinent check is revealed.

Description

Chained for eons beneath the deepest waves of the endless
seas, danavas are the eldest and first of the great outsiders
collectively known as titans. Conceived originally at the
foundation of reality to govern and regulate the mercurial
forces that shaped the cosmos, danavas ultimately proved
too harsh, too rigid, and too unf linching for their
mission. Finally, when the danavas went to war with their
chaotic and less powerful brethren, the gods interceded
before creation was rent asunder, placing their elder
children in stasis beneath the waves, buried at the cruxes
of many worlds.

Danavas resemble thick-even rotund-but extremely
muscular humans of incredible size. Reaching heights
of 75 to 100 feet, danavas can weigh up to 200 tons. Their
ancient ornamentations cover most of their red-brown
skin, and their helmets always reveal their wagon-wheelsized,
pupilless eyes.

Since the time of their imprisonment, the danavas have
seldom emerged from beneath the waves. When freed
from its sequestration, a danava surfaces in an attempt to
restore balance to the world, whether through the raising
of an elder god, perhaps devastating a race of humanoids
on the brink of a destructive discovery or crushing the
unchecked hubris of their own lesser kin. And although
danavas focus singularly on their targets, they coldly and
ruthlessly dispatch enemies attempting to thwart that
goal, raining down lightning and laying waste to entire
cities, wreaking fearsome havoc that becomes the stuff of
legends. In combat, the titans typically use their massive
brawn in conjunction with its mythic resilience to outlast
enemies, saving their spell-like abilities for specific
targets that pose a greater danger.

While the forces that release danavas into the world are
mysterious, the great outsiders function with autonomy.
If a danava's fury is successfully checked or resisted,
the creature can be reasoned with. Typically, the titan
divulges its charge and purpose, and explains the need for
its actions, but without looking for pardon or expressing
remorse. Danavas see the absolutes of the universe and
rarely appreciate complexity or nuance. While danavas are
usually lawful neutral, some lawful good and lawful evil
danavas do exist. Lawful good danavas endeavor to cause
the minimum necessary destruction to achieve their
goals. Once they have righted whatever imbalance they
were released to fix, danavas return to the fathomless
depths until again no living memory of them remains.

Danava Pillar

Certain danavas have, over the eons, merged with
the cruxes of the universe they oversee. These danava
pillars are more powerful than normal,
and destroying one would be a step toward
unraveling reality itself, so they are targets
for creatures like the hundun, who
wish to destroy entire dimensions. Danava pillars
are always 10th mythic rank, and they vary from
CR 25 to 30. This increase comes from templates
like the advanced simple template, class levels,
or both. Each danava pillar gains a unique
ability from its connection to the fundamental
linchpins of the universe, including (but not
limited to) the following.

Akashic Guru (Ex): The danava pillar is
connected to the Akashic Record.
It gains a +20 racial bonus on
all Knowledge checks, and it
can expend 1 point of mythic
power to recall its previous self
from the Akashic Record without spending an action. If it does
so, it is restored to full hit points, regains all uses
of its spell-like abilities, and loses all conditions
and spells currently affecting it (beneficial or
detrimental); it does not regain any uses of mythic
power. Since the ability does not require an action,
the danava pillar can use this ability even when it
can't take actions, as the universe itself attempts to
prevent the threatened destruction of the pillar.

Temporal Lord (Ex): The danava pillar is
connected to the Dimension of Time, and
its multidimensional existence doesn't connect or relate
to time in the same way as a typical creature's. Each round,
just before its normal actions, the danava pillar benefits
from effects identical to those of the spell time stop (though
this isn't a spell effect). It doesn't spend an action to do
so-this is simply a natural consequence of its nonlinear
experience of time.

Yin and Yang (Ex): The danava pillar is connected
to the Positive and Negative Energy Planes and the
transmigration of souls. Both positive and negative
energy heal the pillar (whether channeled to heal or to
harm), and it can channel positive and negative energy
at will once per round each as a free action. The
channeled energy's effect is as a 20th-level cleric's.
The danava pillar gains Selective Channeling
as a bonus feat. Finally, a creature reduced to 0
hit points or below by any of the danava pillar's
attacks is instantly reincarnated into its next life.
Unlike the spell reincarnate, this transforms the
creature into an infant with no class levels
and little or no memory of its former life.
Restoring the original creature from its
new incarnation requires a miracle, a
wish, or similar magic, and as doing
so simultaneously eliminates
the new incarnation, it could
have profound moral or ethical
implications for the restorer.
