Xotani (The Firebleeder) - Monsters







Spawn of Rovagug, Xotani (The Firebleeder)

Like a living volcanic eruption, the sheer massiveness of this titan defies all reason. Monstrously shaped in part like a gigantic, terrible centipede and in part like some primeval, wingless dragon, this living holocaust is completely armored over in plates of angry, obsidian-sharp magma. Two massive claws like insectile scythes sheer before the burning terror as is skitters forth in rapid bursts of motion, leaving only flames and barren earth smoldering in its wake.

Special Abilities

Blindsight (Ex) Xotani can "see" by emitting highfrequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow it to ascertain objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this ability, but its other forms of vision prevent it from being utterly blinded.

Breath Weapon (Su) 70-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds, damage 16d10 fire, Reflex DC 43 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Firebleed (Ex) As a creature of living fire and wrath, Xotani ferociously strikes back against any creature that wounds it. Any attack that does more than 10 points of damage to Xotani causes the wound to erupt in a 30-foot cone of magma. This cone deals 1d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every 10 points of damage dealt by the attack. Thus, an attack dealing 22 points of damage results in a cone dealing 3d6 points of fire damage, while an attack dealing 49 points of damage results in a cone dealing 5d6 points of fire damage. Creatures affected by the cone may make a DC 43 Reflex save to take only half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ranged attacks and any magical attacks that deal damage also cause this special ability to take effect. Xotani cannot firebleed at will, but might do so 10 times per round (an amount equal to its Constitution modifier).

Frightful Presence (Su) Xotani can inspire terror by attacking. Affected creatures must succeed on a DC 35 Will save or become shaken, remaining in that condition as long as they remain within 60 feet of Xotani. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Heat (Ex) Xotani generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures striking Xotani with natural attacks or unarmed attacks are subject to this damage, but creatures striking with melee weapons do not take damage from its heat. This heat can melt or char weapons; any weapon that strikes Xotani is allowed a DC 43 Fortitude save to avoid destruction. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Improved Grab (Ex) To use this ability, Xotani must hit a Huge or smaller opponent with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.

Regeneration (Ex) No form of attack deals lethal damage to Xotani. Xotani regenerates even if it fails a saving throw against a disintegrate spell or a death effect. If Xotani fails its save against a spell or effect that would kill it instantly (such as those mentioned above), the spell or effect instead deals nonlethal damage equal to the creature's full normal hit points +10 (or 738 hp). Xotani is immune to effects that produce incurable or bleeding wounds, such as mummy rot, a sword with the wounding special ability, or a clay golem's cursed wound ability.

Xotani can be slain only by raising its nonlethal damage total to its full normal hit points +10 (or 738 hit points), at least half of which must be inflicted by cold damage, and using a wish or miracle spell to keep it dead.

If Xotani loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in 1d6 minutes (the detached piece dies and decays normally). Xotani can reattach the severed member instantly by holding it to the stump.

Sunlight Blindness (Ex) Abrupt exposure to sunlight (such as sunlight, but not a daylight spell) blinds Xotani for 1 round. On subsequent rounds, it is dazzled while operating in direct sunlight.

Swallow Whole (Ex) When Xotani begins its turn with a grappled opponent in its mouth, it can swallow that opponent whole with a successful grapple check. Once inside Xotani, the opponent takes 2d8+7 points of bludgeoning damage plus 20d6 points of fire damage per round from being submerged in the magma pool that is Xotani's stomach. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 50 points of damage to the gizzard (AC 25). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. Xotani's gullet can hold 2 Huge, 8 Large, 32 Medium, 128 Small, or 512 Tiny or smaller creatures.

Trample (Ex) Reflex DC 47 half. The save DC is Strength-based.

Description

A being of living flame and magma, crawled from the depths of Golarion and the prison of the caged god of destruction, Xotani the Firebleeder is one of the unfathomable monstrosities known and feared as the Spawn of Rovagug. A creature born of rage within the unfathomable depths of the world, it is a creature of pure devastation and hottest flames knowing only wrath, fire, and the harsh stone of the realms below. The surface world is pain to Xotani, especially the cursed sun, from which it retreats by day. By night, however, it bursts from the depths, preceded by sweeping firestorms and deadly claws and followed by a trail like a burnt pyre, all charred ruins and smoking corpses. It is rumored that vast tunnel systems melted into the earth by the passage of the Firebleeder spiderweb the lands of northeastern Garund-the region most devastated by Xotani's rampages-to modern times, immense subterranean corridors that still burn with the Spawn of Rovagug's passage.

Like the majority of Rovagug's ruinous children, Xotani is wrath and devastation given life. It has no desires or intentions beyond destroying all that crosses its path and consuming the ashes. All the life, growth, and creations of the surface worlds are anathema to the living holocaust, which takes some measure of primal satisfaction in crushing the charred remains of such order, yet finds itself endlessly frustrated and incensed by the openness of the surface, the tepid storms and weak rages of weather, and the endless number of wet, hollowing things that fall in its wake. It makes no distinction between the servants of its terrible parent and all the other pathetic things of the lands above, burning and devouring all, caring nothing for whether its living tinder sees its flames as blessing or damnation.

Numerous attempts were made to slay the Firebleeder before its rampage finally came to an end. Through innate cunning and unstoppable profane determination, the titanic abomination survived numerous and varied attempts to lay it low, including potent freezing magics, being magically dropped from an incredible height, and immersion in the Obari Ocean. Yet, despite its seemingly invincible form, Xotani was destroyed by an alliance of potent mages in 2104 ar, who, at the cost of untold lives, ended its rampage across northern Garund in the Brazen Peaks of western Katapesh. The remains of the Firebleeder's corpse lie in the volcanic caverns beneath the spire known as Pale Mountain-a peak said to take its color from the crushed bones of those who died battling the beast. Yet no terror as relentless as a Spawn of Rovagug ever truly dies, and there are those who would see the flames of Xotani rekindled to scour the dross of the world anew.

The spawn of Rovagug are titanic terrors, slavering monstrosities of immense size and strength that live only to destroy. They are unnatural things, born of a fundamental wrongness in the universe where entropy gnaws at the root of reality. None know whether the spawn of Rovagug are the literal children of the Rough Beast in a biological sense, for it is almost impossible to think of what manner of creature could survive copulation with Rovagug or the gestation of such terrible abominations. Perhaps their foremothers are not remembered because these beasts ripped their way from the womb with their own claws, tearing and rending their way to matricidal freedom. Some sages speculate that perhaps Lamashtu herself bore them in one monstrous brood at the dawn of time, before Rovagug's imprisonment, but none of her blasphemous rites or scriptures attests to this, and her faithful make no claim that these terrors are sacred to the Mother of Monsters.

Whatever their provenance, spawn of Rovagug are living engines of destruction, slumbering for long periods before awakening with an incomprehensible hunger for sustenance and devastation. Their rampages lack cruelty or premeditation. If they indeed can trace any lineage to the Rough Beast, they did not inherit his spirit of hateful and wanton viciousness. Instead, they are comparatively simple creatures, their urges to destroy purely instinctual. They wreak havoc because it is what they were created to do, each in their own way. It may be that spawn of Rovagug represent a divergence in the fabric of reality, a natural flaw that seeks to unravel the threads of the universe even as the universe attempts to heal itself around them, which in turn the spawn of Rovagug experience as a suffocating constriction. They must destroy if they are to survive, rending reality to create space to breathe, f iguratively speaking. Their apparent satiation at the end of rampages may simply represent the spawn unraveling the order of the universe suff iciently to allow them to once more rest in peace. Their hibernation resumes until the universe knits itself back together too tightly, choking the spawn once more until they rise yet again in another waking rampage of annihilation.

It is known that certain strange and nigh-impossible rituals are capable of attracting the attention of a spawn of Rovagug or awakening one from long hibernation. Such rituals may draw the spawn to a place or perhaps point it in a certain direction, but taking full control of a spawn of Rovagug is wholly impossible. The earliest recorded appearance of a spawn of Rovagug, in ancient Ninshabur, was of Festering Ulunat, the Unholy First, whose immortal carapace towers over Osirion's capital of Sothis and has spawned countless legends about a future end-time wherein he might reawaken. Perhaps the most famous of Rovagug's living spawn is the Tarrasque, the Armageddon Engine, but Wrath-Blazing Xotani, the Firebleeder, and Unyielding Kothogaz, the Dance of Disharmony, have reputations no less terrifying in Garund and Vudra, respectively, among those aware of their existence.

Spawn of Rovagug Traits

Spawn of Rovagug are Colossal magical beasts, and gain the normal features of a creature of that type as well as the following traits common to all spawn of Rovagug.

Damage Reduction (Ex) Spawn of Rovagug have DR 15/epic.

Frightful Presence (Su) Spawn of Rovagug radiate an aura of terror in a 300-foot radius.

Hibernation (Ex) Spawn of Rovagug can sleep for years, decades, or even centuries and do not need to eat or breathe during these periods of dormancy, though they breathe normally and eat ravenously and almost constantly once they've been awakened. If a spawn of Rovagug is forced into an environment where it cannot breathe and would suffocate, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken.

While in hibernation, a spawn of Rovagug's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.

Immunities (Ex) All spawn of Rovagug are immune to ability damage, bleed, disease, energy drain, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, permanent wounds, petrification, poison, and polymorph. In addition, each spawn of Rovagug possesses immunity to two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.

Regeneration (Ex) All spawn of Rovagug possess regeneration, and no form of attack can suppress this regeneration; they regenerate even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If a spawn of Rovagug fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug has yet to be discovered.

Spell Resistance (Su) A spawn of Rovagug possesses spell resistance equal to 11 + its CR.

Unstoppable Force (Ex) A spawn of Rovagug can always charge, even if its movement is impeded or its path is blocked by another creature. It receives a +20 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to overrun and Strength checks to break or destroy objects, and can make one such check as a free action as part of a charge. In addition, the natural weapons of a spawn of Rovagug ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.
