Special Abilities

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A magnetite golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. <ul><li>Any spell that deals fire damage instead disables a magnetite golem's inescapable grip, magnetic disarm, and magnetic field for 1d4 rounds, with no saving throw.</li><li>A magical attack that deals electricity damage heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A magnetite golem receives no saving throw against electricity effects.</li></ul>Inescapable Grip (Ex) Whenever a magnetite golem hits a metallic creature or a creature wearing metal armor with its slam attack, it attempts to grapple the creature as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If a magnetite golem successfully grapples such a creature, it partially adheres to the golem's body, and the golem needs only one arm to maintain the grapple. In these instances, a magnetite golem may still make a single slam attack on its turn with its remaining arm.

Magnetic Disarm (Su) Whenever a magnetite golem hits a creature wielding a metal weapon with its slam attack, it attempts to disarm the weapon as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the golem successfully disarms a metal weapon, the weapon sticks to the golem's magnetic body rather than dropping to the ground. The golem is considered to have possession of the weapon, and the weapon must be retrieved using a disarm combat maneuver.

Magnetic Field (Su) A magnetite golem is surrounded by a magnetic field, which pulls all metallic creatures and objects toward it. At the start of a magnetite golem's turn, as a free action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, the golem attempts a combat maneuver check against every creature within 30 feet that is connected to a piece of metal. Affected creatures include (but are not limited to) metallic creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, and creatures wielding metal weapons. If the golem succeeds at its combat maneuver against a creature, the affected creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the golem, and can't move away from the golem during its next round. The magnetic field is stronger than gravity, and can pull creatures off the ground. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Large or smaller metal objects automatically travel toward magnetite golem at a rate of 10 feet per round. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.

Description

Though softer than iron golems-upon whom their design is based-and problematic in most industrial settings, magnetite golems still prove to be useful, specialized constructs for both security and salvage. A magnetite golem's humanoid body is made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral. A magnetite golem mindlessly obeys its creator's instructions, and, like most golems, shrugs off the most devastating magical assaults. To complicate matters, a magnetite golem emits a magnetic field, which forcefully pulls metallic objects closer-including creatures holding metal weapons or clad in metal armor. Once within range, metal-bearing opponents find it difficult to pull themselves away. Magnetite golems specialize in grappling and disarming creatures that rely on metal equipment.

Magnetite golems are usually about 9 feet tall, and weigh approximately 1,500 pounds.

Ecology

Magnetite golems prove tricky to build for even experienced golem crafters. Because of the sheer amount of magnetite required for their construction, these golems must be constructed in specially designed workshops with brass, stone, or wooden tools.

While magnetite golems are invaluable in specific circumstances, they are equally inconvenient in other instances. Due to the golems' magnetic fields, small metal bits constantly fly toward them and cling to their bodies, perpetually covering them in metal detritus-chains, fittings, scrap metal, and the occasional tool or weapon. A golem's owner must regularly pry off such debris, lest the clinging metal clog the construct's joints. Additionally, the golem's magnetic field prohibits using any kind of mundane metal objects (like basic tools, locks, or nails) nearby. Due to this, wealthy individuals in the market for golems usually purchase iron, stone, or wood golems. However, in the rare cases in which a magnetite golem is the perfect tool for the job, it proves a devastatingly effective weapon.

Habitat and Society

Magnetite golems have existed on Golarion for many millennia. Explorers delving into Thassilonian ruins occasionally come across these hulking guardians. In Edasseril, the Thassilonian nation tied to the sin of envy, some powerful wizards commanded magnetite golems, and delighted in the constructs' ability to seize their foes' prized possessions.

Because of the unique difficulties associated with the crafting of magnetite golems, the production of new specimens is a rare event. Only a few workshops-such as Magnimar's famous Golemworks or the forges of Quantium-have the resources necessary to create these golems.

Most magnetite golems toil as guardians. A few individuals use magnetite golems for private security, including particularly wealthy alchemists and mages who wish to protect nonmetallic caches of alchemical reagents, artwork, spell components, or tomes. A few jealous warlords even protect their legendary armor or weapons by attaching them to the backs of magnetite golem guardians. For eccentrics who work exclusively with glass, paper, or wood, magnetite golems are ideal companions. Magnetite golems are sometimes tasked to guard lightly trafficked areas that hold objects of cultural, historical, or material value, such as spacious tombs or far-flung libraries.

A few paranoid aristocrats and wealthy thieves' guilds station magnetite golems at their visitor's entrances, as the inexorable pull of the golems' auras reveal even the most thoroughly hidden weapons. Individuals with substantial wealth may also station magnetite golems in secret passageways leading to their hidden vaults. Even if a magnetite golem fails to notice an intruder, its magnetic aura still pulls the intruder and her metallic gear closer. The thundering crash of metal objects striking the golem conveniently alerts other nearby guardians.

Construction

A magnetite golem's body is sculpted from 1,500 pounds of pure magnetite, smelted with rare oils worth 5,000 gp.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They stand apart from other constructs in the nature of their animating force-golems are granted their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the will of the golem's creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of another, but the golem's creator can always resume control by commanding the golem to obey him alone.


Constructing a Golem

The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components used in its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the materials required and the total cost for its creation.

Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. Building a golem with the advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.


Shield Guardians

A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the golem's construction-a completed golem cannot later be "upgraded" to function as a shield guardian.

Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so). If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.

Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base golem, but with the following additional special qualities. A shield guardian's CR is equal to the base golem's CR + 2.

Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of its amulet is within 30 feet.

Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.

Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can locate the amulet's wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.

Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.

Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).

Construction: A shield guardian's base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem's cost. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem's kind. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time-it costs 20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian's total cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. The creator must have a minimum caster level of 2 higher than the base golem's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells are added to the base golem's requirements: discern location and either shield or shield other.
