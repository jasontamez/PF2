The Grim White Stag - Monsters







Herald, The Grim White Stag

This gigantic stag-like being blurs the line between plant and beast, its horns branching like the limbs of some ancient, leaf less tree.

Special Abilities

Bugle (Ex) The Stag can make a distinctive call that can be heard for miles. All who worship Erastil immediately recognize the sound and know the direction and general distance to it.

Cascade of Spears (Su) Once per day, the Stag can shed fragments of its antlers, creating up to 18 +1 shortspears, +1 spears, or +1 longspears in any combination (or substitute five +1 arrows or +1 crossbow bolts for each spear). These weapons retain their magic for 18 minutes, after which they become common weapons made of antler.

Heroes' Feast (Sp) The Stag lies down and dies to begin the "casting" of this ability, its body becoming a magical feast feeding up to 18 creatures. At the next sunrise, it returns to life with full hit points.

Protective Aura (Su) This ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws, but only against attacks or effects from evil creatures.

Description

Erastil's herald is rarely seen more than once in a given generation, and only when a settlement is in mortal danger. All good creatures of the forest recognize its near-divinity and come when they hear its bugling call. Other than its mighty summons, it does not speak to humanoids. It stands 60 feet tall and weighs approximately 140 tons.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
