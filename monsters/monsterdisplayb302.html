Get of Iblis - Monsters







Get of Iblis

Unspeakable pallid flesh twitches and quivers across the grotesque bulk of this vaguely insectile monstrosity. Behind a ravening maw of needle-sharp teeth twists a bulbous, eyeless head covered in a veined membrane. Beyond this amorphous mass coils a long, segmented body bearing dozens of scuttling legs covered in chitinous armor and ending in a pincer-like double stinger. The foremost legs are oversized and folded back like those of a mantis, but with jagged, metallic growths along its clawed edges.

Special Abilities

Amphibious (Ex) The get of Iblis can survive equally well in or out of water.

Devour Elemental (Su) This ability functions against any creature that has one or more of the elemental subtypes of air, earth, fire, or water. Any such creature that suffers bite damage from a get of Iblis gains one negative level. A get of Iblis can critically hit a creature with one of these subtypes with its bite attack even if the target creature is normally immune to or resistant to additional damage from critical hits-this represents the get of Iblis's ability to gnaw apart such creatures and consume portions of their body with shocking alacrity.

Genie Sense (Ex) The get of Iblis can pinpoint genies within 100 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsense ability to that range.

Penetrating Strike (Ex) The get of Iblis's natural weapons are embedded with growths of adamantine-these attacks bypass DR/adamantine.

Poison (Su) Injury, Fortitude DC 25, initial damage 2d6 Str, secondary damage 2d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based. If the initial saving throw is failed, the target is also affected by dimensional anchor (CL 15th) for 2d6 rounds.

Description

The get of Iblis (known to some as "Iblis's begotten" or the "brood of Iblis") are massive, multi-legged wormlike creatures with vicious claws of adamantine and the ability to devour the very essence of genies and elemental creatures. Appearing much like monstrously huge parasites or insectile beings sculpted from the most unfit of living flesh, these things know only sleep and unrestrained hunger, proving endlessly ravenous for the lives of genie-kind. These revolting creatures' armored bodies grow as long as 60 feet and weigh as much as 100,000 pounds. They have no known natural limit to their life spans unless they meet a violent end.
