Special Abilities

Creature of the Night (Su) A mngwa exists
only at night, appearing at sunset and
fading away at sunrise. It receives the
benefit of a heal spell (CL 15th) each
night when it reappears. A mngwa's
connection to darkness is so strong
that it has sunlight powerlessness even
within the effects of a daylight spell.
However, a daylight spell that affects a
mngwa loses 10 minutes of duration
for each round it affects a mngwa
in this way.

Focus of Hate (Su) A mngwa comes into being to punish a hated
creature or group of creatures, and survives only as long as
its focus of hate exists. The mngwa fades away permanently
if its focus of hate dies (or if all members of the group die). A
mngwa knows the direction and general distance to its focus
of hate (or the nearest member in the case of a group). This
sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks scrying. While
its focus of hate exists, a mngwa destroyed through violence
fades away and reappears fully restored in 1d4+1 days. The
only way to permanently destroy a mngwa is to appease the
spirits responsible for its creation-typically by killing its focus
of hate or redressing the wrong that angered the spirits.

Jungle Stealth (Ex) A mngwa in forest terrain can move at full
speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.

Murderous Claws (Ex) A mngwa deals an additional 1d6 points
of bleed damage with its claw and rake attacks, and each
subsequent successful claw and rake attack increases the
amount of bleed damage by 1 (up to a maximum of 1d6+7
points of bleed damage). A successful DC 20 Heal check or
the application of any magical healing stops the bleeding.

Description

Mngwas are the incarnation of malevolent jungle spirits,
driven by anger directed toward their focus of hate-a
specific creature, family, or community who has despoiled
the jungle or desecrated a sacred site. A mngwa exists only
between sunset and sunrise. Each day at sunset the mngwa
materializes near the spot on which it first manifested, and
each day at sunrise the mngwa fades back into nothingness.
Legendary for their skill at evading hunters, mngwas
sometimes haunt a region for centuries, continuing to
stalk the members of large tribes or extended families
responsible for some ancient transgression.

Mngwas average 15 feet in length
and weigh 3,000 pounds.
