Special Abilities

Blisterwomb (Su) Once per day as a standard action, Oaur-Ooung can cause one of the immense, pulsating blisters on her body to erupt. This creates a 30-foot cone of freezing fluid that deals 20d6 points of cold damage and knocks creatures standing in the area prone. With a successful DC 36 Reflex save, a creature takes half the damage and avoids being knocked prone. At the same time, a number of fully-grown qlippoth equal to a CR 20 encounter emerge from the blister- typically, this consists of four catabolignes (see page 225), but Oaur-Ooung can create any qlippoth she wishes with this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Create Spawn (Su) Once per round as a swift action as she slays a living non-outsider with her slam attack, Oaur-Ooung can transform that slain creature into a qlippoth. The qlippoth she creates must be of a CR no greater than the slain creature's CR - 2, but otherwise the nature of the new qlippoth is chosen by Oaur-Ooung. Once created, the new qlippoth is free-willed and retains no memories of its previous life. A slain creature subjected to this transformation can resist the change with a successful DC 29 Will save. If the save fails, the slain creature cannot be restored to life until the qlippoth it spawned is slain, and even then, only via miracle, true resurrection, or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Horrific Appearance (Su) A creature that succumbs to OaurOoung's horrific appearance is overwhelmed by the scope and size of the immense qlippoth lord, and falls prone in a stupor. In addition to falling prone, the victim is dazed for 1d6 rounds. Each round the victim remains dazed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. If a creature is killed by this damage, its body splits open and a new qlippoth (of a CR equal to no more than that of the target) emerges from the remains.

Massive (Ex) Oaur-Ooung is unhindered by uneven ground and other environmental features that qualify as difficult terrain, though settlements and forested areas are considered difficult terrain for her. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by Oaur-Ooung, and vice versa. Unlike kaiju, which are similarly massive, Oaur-Ooung can make attacks of opportunity against foes of any size and can be flanked by foes of any size. She gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if her entire space is on higher ground than the target. A Huge or smaller creature can climb Oaur-Ooung, but this requires a successful DC 30 Climb check.

Poison (Su) Slam, tentacle, or constrict-injury: save Fort DC 36; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. A creature slain by this poison splits open to spawn a new qlippoth (of a type chosen by Oaur-Ooung and of a CR no greater than that of the victim). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Prodigious Reach (Ex) Once per round as an immediate action, Oaur-Ooung can unfurl her central tentacle to attack any creature she can see within 600 feet with her slam attack. This attack can be used to make an attack of opportunity. She cannot grapple a foe outside of her normal reach of 60 feet.

Reactive Swarms (Ex) Once per round when a creature strikes Oaur-Ooung with a melee weapon, her flesh splits and releases a nauseating spray of swarming vermin that immediately cloud around the attacker. This swarm deals 6d6 points of damage, and the attacker must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This does not require an action on Oaur-Ooung's behalf. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Swarm Mastery (Ex) Oaur-Ooung is immune to swarm damage and cannot be distracted by swarm attacks.

Description

Immense Oaur-Ooung is a horrifically prolific source of soldiers for the qlippoth's war against mortals. It is from this qlippoth lord that a significant number of the Abyss's qlippoth hordes emerge. If through some chance event Oaur-Ooung were permanently slain, the production of qlippoth by the Abyss would not cease entirely, but it would diminish by a noticeable amount-at least, until the Abyss churned out some sort of equally vile and fecund replacement for the slain qlippoth lord.

Oaur-Ooung's Abyssal sanctum is a poisoned ocean with no shoreline. Here and there in its inky depths, submerged mountaintops reach in vain for the churning sea's surface, and leviathans swim through the vastness. Oaur-Ooung is the largest among them, but she keeps no lair as her own, content to drift through the eternal ocean spawning qlippoth large and small. Some are drowned, some she consumes, but enough escape her clutches and the ocean's depths to make their way elsewhere into the Abyss, often via churning vortices to other realms.

Sometimes, the creatures born from OaurOoung's blisterwombs are particularly powerful; it's rumored that at least one of the Abyss's demon lords began its existence as a qlippoth lord emerging from Oaur-Ooung. Those few who have recently seen Oaur-Ooung (and survived) claim that a blisterwomb of unprecedented size boils on her flank, suggesting that she is about to spawn something of immense power. What this new addition to the Abyss might be and what form it might take is unknown, but it surely bodes ill for mortal life on countless worlds.

Oaur-Ooung's body is 120 feet long, but her central tentacular stalk can unfurl to a length of miles for brief moments to lash out at creatures that have the distinct misfortune of having attracted her attention.

Oaur-Ooung's Cult

Worshipers of Oaur-Ooung tend to be obsessed with one thing: the overwhelming desire to be transformed into a qlippoth. These cultists are not to be pitied, for their desires are not born out of shame. They believe that the qlippoth will win, and that by securing early transformation into one of these destructive beings, they will live on in the world they know will eventually replace all of reality. That they will retain none of their mortal memories or personalities is no deterrent to these people, as long as they survive in some form while the rest of their kind do not. Many have already abandoned their racial identities, repudiating their original cultures and pursuing magical or surgical alteration. Oaur-Ooung is worshiped on desolate coastlines and within the ruins of wracked or sunken ships, and sacrifices to her are often subjected to vile fleshwarping rituals in which their bodies become unholy components for transformative rituals designed to "evolve" the faithful and consume worshipers' foes.

Oaur-Ooung's symbol is a jellyfish-shaped rune, and her favored weapon is the trident. This qlippoth lord grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Plant, and Water, and to the subdomains of Decay, Fear, Growth, and Oceans.

The creatures known as qlippoth (the singular and plural forms are the same) are as mysterious as they are horrifying, as one might expect of the first form of life imagined by reality. These monsters hail from a time when morality did not exist, when gods and mortals were unknown, when, perhaps, time itself had not yet begun to unfurl. Certainly, the qlippoth were old when the first proteans brought order to chaos and discovered the endless tunnels of the Abyss running through the underworld of the Outer Planes. What the race's goals and desires may have been in that unimaginably distant past is unknown, and more to the point, cannot be known to minds that have the current reality as their only point of reference. Just as reality changes what it touches, so did the introduction of the qlippoth to the reality of the Outer Planes change them. Enemies of all they encounter, they warred on any who would dare encroach upon their domains. And when no enemies dared approach, the qlippoth took their wars to others instead, boiling up out of the Abyss in seemingly endless armies.

But as vast and potent as the qlippoth may be, there are those among them that eclipse the power of them all- unique and powerful qlippoth lords that rule the deepest and darkest Abyssal depths. The number of qlippoth lords active today represents only a small fraction of those that existed at the dawn of creation. As the eons wore on, the qlippoth lords were opposed by nearly all who learned of their existence. Demon lords, archdevils, empyreal lords, and the deities themselves have taken offense at the blasphemy of the qlippoth lords, and have destroyed many of the more powerful among them. Those who remain are either shadows of the qlippoth lords' one-time glory or are so adept at hiding their true natures that none have yet glimpsed even hints of their forms.

The bulk of qlippoth lords range in strength from CR 21 to 25. More powerful creatures akin to the Horsemen or archdevils in stature may still exist in the deepest parts of the Abyss, but for now, these theoretical qlippoth demigods remain mysteries. Certainly, any active qlippoth lords are potent enough to threaten and endanger the bulk of mortal life when they choose to turn their attention to the Material Plane.

Some qlippoth have chosen to abandon their roots and accept the demonic as the new order of the Abyss. Qlippoth lords who accept sin and allow themselves to be transformed often gain a significant boost in power that catapults them out of this lower tier directly into the ranks of demon lords, but only at the cost of forever losing any tenuous alliances they may have had with the first lords of the Abyss. These former qlippoth lords are seen as the worst kind of traitors by the qlippoth and their masters, but for these qlippoth, the trade-off is more than worth it, as the power they now wield as demon lords is formidable. Demon lords who began existence as qlippoth lords include primeval entities like <a href="deitydisplaya05d.html?ItemName=Dagon">Dagon</a> and <a href="deitydisplay3054.html?ItemName=Jubilex">Jubilex</a>, but are hardly limited to these alone.

The four qlippoth lords presented on the following pages have interests in multiple Material Plane worlds. Others, such as the Polymorph Plague Yamasoth, the Warmonger Queen Shiggarreb, and the Enigma Clot Aonaurious, have focused their wrath on specific worlds or have yet to fully emerge from the deepest recesses of the Abyss to turn their attentions to the worlds beyond, and are not detailed in this book.


Qlippoth Lord Sanctums

Although the qlippoth lords are powerful, their strength does not equal that of their most hated enemies, the demon lords. But in their deepest, hidden lairs in the most remote corners of the Abyss, qlippoth lords are much more potent threats. As long as they remain in these domains (or can at least retreat there in times of need), they are well protected from retribution. These lairs are known as sanctums, and while methods of reaching and entering them are occult and obscure, a sanctum can be vast in size.

Within its sanctum, a qlippoth lord gains the following additional powers (with the exception of the mythic ability, the statistics presented on the following pages do not include these abilities). <ul><li>Mythic: A qlippoth lord functions as a <a href="rules0baf.html?Name=Mythic%20Monsters&amp;Category=Mythic%20Rules">10th-rank mythic creature</a>, including having the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). It can expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic version of any spell-like ability denoted with a superscript "M," just as if the ability were a mythic spell.</li> <li>Rejuvenation: The mind of a qlippoth lord that is slain in its sanctum merges with a qlippoth of the lord's choosing, selected from any living qlippoth within the lord's sanctum. This functions as per <a href="spelldisplayf8af.html?ItemName=mind%20swap,%20major">major mind swap</a>, except there is no save to avoid its effect and the typical qlippoth immunity to mind-affecting effects offers no protection. After 1d100 years, the qlippoth transforms into a new incarnation of its previous body as a qlippoth lord, but if slain before this transformation, the qlippoth lord is forever dead.</li> <li>A qlippoth lord can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: <a href="spelldisplay1d83.html?ItemName=astral%20projection">astral projection</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf8a0.html?ItemName=binding">binding</a>, <a href="spelldisplayf22f.html?ItemName=demand">demand</a>, <a href="spelldisplay5dd5.html?ItemName=discern%20location">discern location</a>, <a href="spelldisplayfd7c.html?ItemName=fabricate">fabricate</a>, <a href="spelldisplay36ee.html?ItemName=major%20creation">major creation</a>, <a href="spelldisplay46d4.html?ItemName=miracle">miracle</a> (limited to physical effects that manipulate the sanctum or to effects that are relevant to the qlippoth lord's interests), and <a href="spelldisplayd28c.html?ItemName=polymorph%20any%20object">polymorph any object</a> (when used on objects or creatures that are native to the sanctum, the polymorph duration factor increases by 6).</li></ul>
