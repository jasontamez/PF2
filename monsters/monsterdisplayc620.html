Special Abilities

Burning Cold (Su) An owb prophet can conjure a ball of flickering flames and hurl it at an opponent as an attack action, or hurl four balls of flame as a full-attack action. These flames are ranged touch attacks with a range of 120 feet with no range increment. Each flame deals 3d6 points of cold damage. Any creature struck by the flames must succeed at a DC 24 Reflex save or become entangled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Curse of Darkness (Su) With a touch, an owb prophet can make bright light unbearable to the victim. A creature touched must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or gain the light blindness weakness. This ability also robs the victim of its coloration, leaving the creature and its equipment washed-out shades of gray. This effect can be removed with <a href="spelldisplay8624.html?ItemName=break%20enchantment">break enchantment</a> or <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a>, unless the target has the <a href="monstersubtypes5610.html?ItemName=Dark%20Folk">dark folk</a> subtype, in which case the effect can be removed only by <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a> or similar magic. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Deific An owb prophet can grant divine spells to its worshippers. Granting spells doesn't require any specific action on the owb prophet's behalf. Owb prophets grant access to the domains of <a href="domaindisplay95e4.html?ItemName=Darkness">Darkness</a>, <a href="domaindisplay4f4d.html?ItemName=Evil">Evil</a>, <a href="domaindisplay5f1e.html?ItemName=Madness">Madness</a>, and <a href="domaindisplay3da5.html?ItemName=Trickery">Trickery</a>. Their symbols and favored weapons vary based on the owb prophet's Forsaken patron.

Forsaken Patron Each owb prophet serves as a conduit to one of the distant, shadowy demigods known as the Forsaken. Forsaken patrons are described below, and each patron grants the owb prophet additional abilities. The choice of Forsaken patron cannot be changed.

Description

Few remember that the Shadow Plane once had its own demigods, akin to the Eldest of the First World. Called the Forsaken, these mysterious, evil entities had a direct hand in shaping the caligni race but then vanished for unknown reasons. Although caligni cannot call upon the Forsaken, the sinister <a href="monsterdisplay0781.html?ItemName=Owb">owbs</a> can still reach these distant demigods by performing esoteric rituals in remote temples on the Shadow Plane.

An owb who successfully contacts one of the Forsaken gains a fragment of the demigod's power and forms a permanent connection to that Forsaken patron. This contact causes dramatic physical changes, often forcing the owb to swell in size and sprout additional limbs, but the most significant change is that the owb becomes a divine conduit. Known as owb prophets, these god-touched beings grant spells to faithful worshippers on behalf of their Forsaken patrons. Unfortunately for the Forsaken, owb prophets don't pass along this divine energy gladly, always seeking a way to hoard it for themselves. The most cunning owb prophets develop long-term plans to ascend to the status of demigod independently and join the ranks of the Forsaken. No owb prophet has yet acquired sufficient spiritual energy to make this leap, but the first to succeed would be more than a peer to the distant Forsaken-it would be the only active Forsaken in the multiverse.

Forsaken Patrons

Although the Forsaken do not have worshippers as most demigods do, owb prophets commit themselves to these mysterious entities and gain the indicated benefits. The most noteworthy Forsaken are described below as they once appeared; their current forms and powers remain purely speculation.

Enkaar, the Malformed Prisoner (NE Forsaken of fetters, lethargy, and physical corruption): Left to die in a festering prison on the Shadow Plane, Enkaar eventually emerged as a mutated horror draped in rusted chains. Enkaar's owb prophets are immune to petrification and paralysis, gain two wing attacks as natural attacks, and can use <a href="spelldisplaydbda.html?ItemName=excruciating%20deformation">excruciating deformation</a> at will as a spell-like ability. Enkaar's symbol is a pus-encrusted fetter, and its favored weapon is the spiked chain.

Eyes That Watch (NE Forsaken of feelings of inferiority, felines, and strangers): None can fully describe the Forsaken known as Eyes That Watch, as it appeared only as a trio of feline eyes staring from shadows with an arrogant gaze. Eyes That Watch's owb prophets gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet, can always act in the surprise round, and can use <a href="spelldisplay2df9.html?ItemName=burning%20gaze">burning gaze</a> at will as a spell-like ability. The flames from this spell-like ability are always a dull yellow and never shed more than dim light. Eyes That Watch's symbol is three feline eyes, and its favored weapon is the dagger.

Grasping Iovett (CE Forsaken of accidents, parasites, and reckless lust): Clad only in heavy black silks that shifted to reveal sensual forms of an indescribable variety, Grasping Iovett's touch left painful welts and tick infestations. Iovett's owb prophets are immune to disease and poison, cannot be grappled unless they choose to be, and automatically succeed at combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to escape a grapple or pin. They can use <a href="spelldisplay5a58.html?ItemName=eruptive%20pustules">eruptive pustules</a> at will as a spell-like ability. Iovett's symbol is a stylized tick on a swatch of silk, and its favored weapon is the short sword.

Husk (NE Forsaken of emptiness, loneliness, and narcissism): Husk was an attractive, androgynous humanoid whose joints were gaps that revealed the Forsaken to be entirely hollow beneath paper-thin skin. Husk's owb prophets are immune to bleed, disease, mind-affecting effects, and poison, and they can use <a href="spelldisplay672f.html?ItemName=silence">silence</a> at will as a spell-like ability. Husk's symbol is an empty humanoid outline with hands outstretched, and its favored weapon is the short sword.

Lady Razor (NE Forsaken of family strife, suspicion, and vengeance): A stern magistrate among the Forsaken, Lady Razor forbade showing kindness or mercy to family members. Lady Razor's owb prophets are proficient with all slashing weapons, never take penalties on attack rolls when fighting with multiple slashing weapons, and can use <a href="spelldisplaybe46.html?ItemName=keen%20edge">keen edge</a> at will as a spell-like ability. Lady Razor's symbol is a gavel crossed with a bloody razor, and her favored weapon is the dagger.

Reshmit of the Heavy Voice (CE Forsaken of broken things, forgetting, and unexpected violence): Reshmit was a Gargantuan shadowy form whose softest touch landed like a hammer blow and whose rumbling voice could shred steel. Reshmit's owb prophets emanate an aura of forgetfulness within 30 feet; each creature in the aura other than owb prophets must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half the owb prophet's Hit Dice + the owb prophet's Charisma modifier) each round or lose one prepared spell or available spell slot. They can use <a href="spelldisplay99a7.html?ItemName=shatter">shatter</a> at will as a spell-like ability. Reshmit's symbol is a torn steel plate, and his favored weapon is the morningstar.

Thalaphyrr Martyr-Minder (LE Forsaken of failed heroics, imprisonment, and squandered time): Thalaphyrr guarded the prisons where the Forsaken kept their would-be usurpers and destroyers. Creatures within 30 feet of Thalaphyrr's owb prophets cannot benefit from morale bonuses. In addition, his owb prophets can use <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> at will as a spell-like ability. Thalaphyrr's symbol is a pair of hands grasping a set of prison bars, and his favored weapon is the spear.
