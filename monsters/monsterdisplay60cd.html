Special Abilities

Benevolent Mercy (Su) When Talmandor uses his lay on hands ability, he also removes all of the following conditions from the target: dazed, nauseated, paralyzed, poisoned, sickened, and stunned.

Channel Positive Energy (Su) Talmandor can expend two uses of his lay on hands ability to channel energy as a 20th-level cleric.

Coruscating Charge (Su) When Talmandor charges, he can transform his body into golden light. He becomes incorporeal until he arrives at the end of his charge and makes his physical attacks. In this form, he radiates light as a daylight spell. Any evil creature whose space he passes through is affected as by sunbeam (Reflex DC 35 negates and Reflex half), while good-aligned creatures whose space he passes through gain the benefit of good hope for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Protective Aura (Su) Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of Talmandor. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against evil effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius of 20 feet (and a caster level of 20th). The defensive benefits from the magic circle are not included in the statistics above.

Quell the Profane (Su) Talmandor's frightful presence aura affects only evil creatures. Evil creatures inside Talmandor's protective aura also become sickened, and profane bonuses are suppressed within his aura unless their caster level exceeds 20th.

Sacred Slasher (Ex) When attacking with his claws, Talmandor adds 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus on damage rolls. He also threatens a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 and multiplies critical hit damage by 3. His claws overcome all damage reduction of evil creatures.

Twin Talons (Ex) When using the attack action, Talmandor can attack a single target with both claws.

Description

Talmandor is the celestial patron of Andoran and a great leader of the avoral agathions, surpassed among their kind only by the empyreal lord Ylimancha, the Harborwing. Talmandor abides in the aptly named Soaring Palace of Talmandor the Golden on the plane of Nirvana, yet travels frequently among the planes. In addition to looking in on the nation that has arisen under his wings, he wanders the Outer Sphere, often acting as an ambassador between mortal priesthoods and the immortal servants of Erastil, Iomedae, and Shelyn.

Like most agathions, Talmandor takes an interest in influencing mortals and bringing them to a place of enlightenment. He is convinced that the greatest enlightenment for mortals can be achieved through social interaction. He has observed that mortals respond best to a full, robust engagement with their fellow citizens, and that it's important to have a voice in the decisionmaking process of one's society. Talmandor sees hereditary aristocracy and primogeniture as shackles slowing society's ascent into a place of justice and peace where all citizens work together for the common good. Talmandor does not want the rights and importance of individuals to be sacrificed for the greater good, and advocates a balance between collective needs and communitarian works on the one hand and the individual's personal responsibilities and liberties on the other.

According to popular legend, Talmandor developed his democratic theories and shared them with the mortal poet Darl Jubannich, who transcribed them in his nowfamous treatise, On Government. However, while Talmandor favored overturning established structures of power where necessary, he never promoted anarchy and has long felt great sadness over how the core tenets of his political philosophy have been twisted beyond recognition in Galt. He strives to promote moderation and peaceful reconciliation within government, even in times of upheaval.

In some parts of Andoran, the adulation Talmandor has earned goes beyond respect to outright worship. The agathion steadfastly refuses to seek godhood in his own right, as he believes he can be a better inspiration to the goals of democratic freedom as a powerful outsider who can aid the mortal citizens of Andoran in times of great need, rather than becoming a godlike creature they worship from afar. Talmandor typically assists only those he feels have earned the right to call upon any ally of Andoran, though he is pleased to give advice to anyone if asked in earnest. He often appears to speak when called upon by the People's Council, offering what guidance he can, but never insists that his suggestions be enacted. He has been known to appear at the meetings of smaller city and town councils as well, though as a guest he does not speak until the council asks him to. Only if Andoran faced some threat it found impossible to handle on its own without his aid would Talmandor take direct action to protect the nation, though his regular presence is certainly considered carefully by Andoran's enemies.

Though Andoran celebrates a feast day in his honor on 4 Erastus, Talmandor insists the celebration is held to honor him in his capacity as one of many heroes of the nation, rather than as its divine protector. Despite his refusal of the mantle of divinity, a few in Andoran (including a small but growing number of oracles and paladins) revere him as a nascent demigod embodying the virtues of hope, liberty, and community, and his worship has begun to grow in small congregations across the country.

Talmandor is closely associated with birds of prey and as a result is the patron of the Steel Falcons order of the Eagle Knights of Andoran, as well as a frequent advisor to leaders within the order. Talmandor inspires their work as ambassadors of liberty, and he sometimes even sends aid to those in the midst of dangerous political missions aimed at cultivating peace. Those who rise to greatness also receive Talmandor's direct blessing, which he sees as a rightful reward for good works and a tool that allows those blessed to achieve even greater things. If called to serve through powerful magic (such as gate), Talmandor generally answers but refuses to grant direct assistance except to those overwhelmingly outmatched by evil foes. Even then, he generally requires any aid he gives be paid for in massive donations to the poor and oppressed, though he also often offers a free alternative to his direct involvement, such as receiving his blessing (often crafted with miracle) or gaining some insight into the caller's foes.
