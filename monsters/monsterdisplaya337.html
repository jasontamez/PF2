Chortov - Monsters







Devil, Chortov

Quivering with heat and barely restrained might, this monstrous, pig-faced titan looms taller than a city wall. Girded in fiendishly etched armor too small for its incredible corpulence, rolls of densely muscled hide spill forth in a flamered avalanche. Gnashing its many-tusked teeth and clutching a wicked military fork, the terrible giant rumbles as if preparing to roar or scream.

Special Abilities

Corrupt Fire (Su) Any fire effect-naturally or magically created-within 50 feet of a chortov is tainted into hellfire by its fury and evil. Aside from being sinisterly colored, hellfire functions like normal fire, except that half the damage dealt by hellfire is fire damage and the other half results from evil energy and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. In addition, all of a chortov's spell-like abilities with the fire subtype produce hellfire instead of normal fire.

Hellfire Soul (Su) Upon being reduced to 0 hit points, a chortov explodes in a blast of hellfire. All creatures within 25 feet take 6d6 points of damage from hellfire (see above; DC 22 Reflex save for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon exploding, the chortov's waning yet still raging soul lingers on as a creature of pure living hellfire. This creature has the same statistics as a Huge fire elemental, except that damage caused by its burn ability results from hellfire and it is not vulnerable to cold. Every round that this hellfire elemental exists, it loses 10 hit points until it dissipates completely.

Infernal Bondage (Su) Chortovs wage Hell's wars not by choice, but due to powerful magical bondage. The armor that binds all chortovs bears an infernal curse that compels these murderous fiends to serve the will of their infernal masters. This compulsion can be temporarily dismissed by a break enchantment, dispel law, or dispel magic spell that overcomes a DC 25 dispel check. This frees the chortov of its bondage for 1d6 minutes, during which the baffled creature acts as though under the effects of the spell confusion. Destroying the armor via sundering attacks also frees the devil for 1d6 minutes, after which the armor magically reforms. A chortov's armor has hardness 13 and 45 hit points.

Wrath (Su) The anger and hatred of chortovs is infectious. Any creature damaged by a weapon wielded by a chortov or a chortov's slam attack must make a DC 17 or be thrown into a haze of murderous rage, being treated as though under the effects of the spells confusion and rage. This mania lasts for 1 minute, but victims may retry their save to resist every round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Towering, rage-wracked brutes enslaved to the will of Hell, chortovs fume upon the borders and ramparts of Hell's hinterlands, murderous deterrents to any who would besiege the shores of the infernal realm or seek to escape. Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but damned nonetheless, chortovs carry with them the rage of those who have suffered the multiverse's cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors. Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering hellfire, these horrors hate all things' other creatures, their fate, and the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past damnation.

Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh, muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov's armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted.

Masters of corruption and despoilers of purity, devils seek to destroy all things good and drag mortal souls back with them to the depths of Hell.

As the most numerous fiendish occupants of Hell, the various forms of devils are well catalogued by diabolists. Most are known by two names: an evocative title given to the fiends by commoners and folklore, and an obscure, ancient designation spoken by the servants of Hell and those who would seek to deal with the damned.

Born from the foulest of mortal souls-their personalities and memories long since scoured by millennia of torment-would-be devils rise from the masses of suffering souls as lemures, revolting beings of mindless evil potentiality. Only through continued centuries of torture or by the edicts of more powerful devils do these least of devilkind rise to become deadlier fiends, graduating through a pain-wracked metamorphosis dictated by their masters or the infernal whims of Hell's semi-sentient layers. While fiendish lords wield transformation into greater or lesser forms as both prize and punishment, some devils spontaneously rise from particularly evil souls long trapped upon an infernal layer. Thus, although the various diabolical breeds possess recognizable abilities and hold generalized rankings in the great infernal hierarchy, a devil's type alone does not always correspond to a specific tenure of torment or place in the infernal chain of command.

Devils fill the nine layers of Hell, though certain fiends are more common on specific layers than others, their specialized duties or fealty to individual archdevils drawing them to one torturous domain more than others. Although the various types of devils tend to specialize in unique forms of depravity or temptation, the hierarchies of Hell are not without flexibility for uncommon individual talents. Thus, particularly watchful hamatulas might join the ranks of Phlegethon's bone devil inquisitors, while veteran barbazus might serve among the pit fiends of Nessus.

Beyond the pits of Hell, devils often travel to the Material Plane at the summons of evil spellcasters. Quick to bargain and willing to serve mortals to assure their damnation, devils ever obey the letter of their agreements, but serve the whims of Hell foremost. Thus, even the least of devilkind might come to the Material Plane intent on further corrupting souls, cleverly escaping the bonds of their contracts to indulge their own plots, or to further the unspeakable goals of the archdevils of Hell.

The Ranks of Devilkind

Diabolists speak often of the rankings of Hell, the distinctions made between devils that distinguish the foot soldiers from the commanders of Hell's armies. While such divisions mean little to most mortals-a devil being a deadly foe in any incarnation-the hierarchies and nuances of Hell's society carry distinctions vital to the survival of any who would commune with devils. What distinguishes a breed of devils above or below others is more than a matter of brawn, with several cunning types of fiend holding priority over their fundamentally stronger brethren. While a devil's station does not mean it can instantly command every other devil of inferior standing, it does imply which fiends might serve their brethren or hold influence over others.

Below these are the devil races themselves, from the lordly and malevolent pit fiends all the way down to the lowly, malformed lemure.

The Infernal Hierarchy

Listed here, from the absolute weakest devils to the lords of Hell, is the most basic hierarchy of the infernal realm's best-known denizens.

Least Devils: imps, lemures
Lesser Devils: bearded devils (barbazus), erinyes, barbed devils (hamatulas), bone devils (osyluths)
Greater Devils: horned devils (cornugons), ice devils (gelugons), pit fiends
