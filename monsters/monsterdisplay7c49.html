Special Abilities

Infused Weapon (Su) Any throwing weapon wielded by a yamah is treated as a +2 returning weapon. This special ability fades 1 minute after a yamah no longer wields the weapon.

Steal Magic (Su) As a standard action, a yamah can make a touch attack against a creature under the effects of a spell or spells and attempt to dispel the effects as per dispel magic (CL 6th). If successful, the yamah absorbs the magical energy and converts it into a bolt of force. A yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st level for the purpose of this ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24 hours of being obtained disappear and are wasted.

Description

Yamahs travel throughout the planes promoting the ideals of freedom and fairness, using their unique talents to rob evildoers of their magic and turn it into a weapon for good. Yamahs harbor ill will toward anyone who would use magic for cruel or evil purposes, especially necromancers and creatures that use magic to trap souls and pervert life.

Though yamahs often bear a stern countenance, they nonetheless enjoy lighthearted pranks and cheery jokes when appropriate. The white markings that cover their bodies may at first appear to be tattoos, but are actually natural sigils unique to each individual. The average yamah stands just over 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds.

Yamahs can often be encountered during lunar eclipses and other significant celestial events in regions where worship of any chaotic good deity or demigod is strong. Legends among such faiths claim that yamahs sometimes accompany good spellcasters on crusades against otherworldly fiends, though every story inevitably ends with the yamah mysteriously departing after the deed is done, abandoning its mortal partner without a word.

Azatas are a race of celestials native to the plane of Elysium, where the pursuit of freedom and goodness is paramount. Azatas are champions of these concepts, great bards, knights, and explorers who roam the planes in search of good folk in need of their help. Frequently described as the most elven or fey-like celestials, azatas nevertheless often have strange, inhuman shapes or can take elemental or eldritch forms. Most have some knightly or courtly title, such as duke, countess, or prince, apparently hereditary, perhaps from a celestial monarchy long abandoned and forgotten. Azatas do not exploit these titles to exert influence over each other, instead using them for personal identification or a bit of self-importance. They are deadly and resolute foes of evil, fearless and clever in battle.

It is not surprising that the three best-known kinds of azatas can all fly, for they rarely stay in one place for long and prefer the thrill of motion and discovery to creature comforts. Most azata "settlements" are little more than a collection of tents around a landmark, gathered over the course of a day to share news, stories, and perhaps good-natured duels, and then packed up again a few days later. Such temporary settlements are colorful and have a celebratory atmosphere, as azatas are quick to greet any of their kind as old friends. Although few can predict when and where an azata community might arise, some groups or breeds of azatas gather in cycles for traditional festivals and reunions. Such gatherings typically take place at a time of mystical consequence, such as on the evening of the lunar equinox, or during less predictable times, such as upon the wedding of two seers, and always in a place of pristine or stunning natural wonder. All azatas fundamentally know when and where the closest or next gathering of their people might occur, and while none are required or even expected to attend, all are welcome. These gatherings do not preclude more permanent azata holdings and communes, however, and the heights of Elysium endlessly ring with the songs of azata choirs.

While the stoic, homebound archons call their cousins flighty, azatas are driven by a crusading nature and feel bored when forced to stay in one place too long. This tendency also means they are unlikely to agree to serve mortals for an extended period of time, preferring to arrive, get the job done, and move on to some other quest or challenge. As much as they seek to spread the cause of freedom and joy, azatas realize that they cannot enforce such virtues throughout the multiverse. Without darkness there can be no light, and without struggle there can be no victory. Understanding this, these celestials remain removed from the majority of mortal conflicts, preferring to act as advisors in such situations rather than champions, granting goodly mortals ownership over their own triumphs. In cases where the forces of evil act overtly, however, and intrude upon mortal worlds, azatas are quick to rally to defend such realms and aid those who have no hope of defending themselves.

Azatas generally work together, but their powerful personalities and strong sense of individual freedom often see them disagreeing on how best to handle a particular situation. While both parties have the greater good at heart, these arguments can fester and grow into long-lasting grudges. In cases where a single azata is convinced his way is right, he might even enter a sort of self-imposed exile, abandoning the support of his kin so he can launch a one-azata crusade against the cruelties of the multiverse.

Most azatas originate from the untamable beauty of Elysium, created and nourished by the influx of goodly mortal souls. Like most other outsiders, they cannot reproduce with each other in the mortal fashion, and often tryst with mortals who prove charming and good spirited. Azatas dally frequently with their own kind, being quick to seek out feelings of love, joy, and companionship, but rarely feel bound or exclusive to merely one lover, regardless of its race.

Azatas speak Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal, but can speak with almost any creature because of their truespeech special ability. See creature subtypes for full details on truespeech and other shared azata traits.
