Description

While many cetaceans are docile, the crimson whale is an aggressive hunter that evolved to quickly kill even the largest and most powerful of prey. It sports a full set of deadly teeth that average between 1 and 2 feet in length, and its powerful bite can tear through f lesh and crush bone. A typical adult crimson whale is 45 feet long and weighs 30 tons.
