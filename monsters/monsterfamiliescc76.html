Spawn of Rovagug

The spawn of Rovagug are titanic terrors, slavering monstrosities of immense size and strength that live only to destroy. They are unnatural things, born of a fundamental wrongness in the universe where entropy gnaws at the root of reality. None know whether the spawn of Rovagug are the literal children of the Rough Beast in a biological sense, for it is almost impossible to think of what manner of creature could survive copulation with Rovagug or the gestation of such terrible abominations. Perhaps their foremothers are not remembered because these beasts ripped their way from the womb with their own claws, tearing and rending their way to matricidal freedom. Some sages speculate that perhaps Lamashtu herself bore them in one monstrous brood at the dawn of time, before Rovagug's imprisonment, but none of her blasphemous rites or scriptures attests to this, and her faithful make no claim that these terrors are sacred to the Mother of Monsters.

Whatever their provenance, spawn of Rovagug are living engines of destruction, slumbering for long periods before awakening with an incomprehensible hunger for sustenance and devastation. Their rampages lack cruelty or premeditation. If they indeed can trace any lineage to the Rough Beast, they did not inherit his spirit of hateful and wanton viciousness. Instead, they are comparatively simple creatures, their urges to destroy purely instinctual. They wreak havoc because it is what they were created to do, each in their own way. It may be that spawn of Rovagug represent a divergence in the fabric of reality, a natural f law that seeks to unravel the threads of the universe even as the universe attempts to heal itself around them, which in turn the spawn of Rovagug experience as a suffocating constriction. They must destroy if they are to survive, rending reality to create space to breathe, f iguratively speaking. Their apparent satiation at the end of rampages may simply represent the spawn unraveling the order of the universe suff iciently to allow them to once more rest in peace. Their hibernation resumes until the universe knits itself back together too tightly, choking the spawn once more until they rise yet again in another waking rampage of annihilation.

It is known that certain strange and nigh-impossible rituals are capable of attracting the attention of a spawn of Rovagug or awakening one from long hibernation. Such rituals may draw the spawn to a place or perhaps point it in a certain direction, but taking full control of a spawn of Rovagug is wholly impossible. The earliest recorded appearance of a spawn of Rovagug, in ancient Ninshabur, was of Festering Ulunat, the Unholy First, whose immortal carapace towers over Osirion's capital of Sothis and has spawned countless legends about a future end-time wherein he might reawaken. Perhaps the most famous of Rovagug's living spawn is the Tarrasque, the Armageddon Engine, but Wrath-Blazing Xotani, the Firebleeder, and Unyielding Kothogaz, the Dance of Disharmony, have reputations no less terrifying in Garund and Vudra, respectively, among those aware of their existence.

**Spawn of Rovagug Traits**

Spawn of Rovagug are Colossal magical beasts, and gain the normal features of a creature of that type as well as the following traits common to all spawn of Rovagug.

**Damage Reduction (Ex)** Spawn of Rovagug have DR 15/epic.
**Frightful Presence (Su)** Spawn of Rovagug radiate an aura of terror in a 300-foot radius.
**Hibernation (Ex)** Spawn of Rovagug can sleep for years, decades, or even centuries and do not need to eat or breathe during these periods of dormancy, though they breathe normally and eat ravenously and almost constantly once they've been awakened. If a spawn of Rovagug is forced into an environment where it cannot breathe and would suffocate, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken.
While in hibernation, a spawn of Rovagug's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.
**Immunities (Ex)** All spawn of Rovagug are immune to ability damage, bleed, disease, energy drain, mind-affecting effects, paralysis, permanent wounds, petrification, poison, and polymorph. In addition, each spawn of Rovagug possesses immunity to two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.
**Regeneration (Ex)** All spawn of Rovagug possess regeneration, and no form of attack can suppress this regeneration; they regenerate even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If a spawn of Rovagug fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug has yet to be discovered.
**Spell Resistance (Su)** A spawn of Rovagug possesses spell resistance equal to 11 + its CR.
**Unstoppable Force (Ex)** A spawn of Rovagug can always charge, even if its movement is impeded or its path is blocked by another creature. It receives a +20 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to overrun and Strength checks to break or destroy objects, and can make one such check as a free action as part of a charge. In addition, the natural weapons of a spawn of Rovagug ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.
