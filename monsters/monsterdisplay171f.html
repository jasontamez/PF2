Special Abilities

Guardian of Jandelay (Su) The Oliphaunt was created to live in Jandelay, and attempting to remove it from the place is almost impossible. The Oliphaunt can prevent a gate or similar effect from opening inside Jandelay's borders unless the effect was created by an artifact or cast by a mythic character. If brought outside Jandelay, the Oliphaunt attempts a Will saving throw each day to return. The DC is equal to the DC of the spell that transported it, or the DC that spell would have if it allowed a saving throw. The return of the Oliphaunt triggers a magical punishment on those that stole it, laying waste to people and land. Centered on the point from which the Oliphaunt just departed, the ward triggers a mass hold monster spell targeting all creatures in a 5-mile radius. Then, that area is affected by an earthquake and storm of vengeance that last 1d12 months. While in Jandelay, the Oliphaunt's dimensional lock aura extends to protect the entire realm.

Massive (Ex) The Oliphaunt is so enormous in scale that it gains the benefits of a kaiju's massive ability (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4).

Ruinous Tusks (Ex) The Oliphaunt's gore attacks are treated as adamantine, and any creature hit by one is affected by a targeted greater dispel magic spell.

Ward against Command (Su) The Oliphaunt is immune to any mind-affecting spell or effect unless the Oliphaunt has line of sight to the caster. Even then, all mind-affecting spells and effects gain the language-dependent descriptor. Magical means of translation such as tongues do not bypass this restriction.

Wards of Jandelay (Su) Ancient protective magic was bound into the essence of the Oliphaunt. The wards give it a +20 deflection bonus to AC, spell resistance 41, and a constant freedom effect.

Weather Sphere (Su) The Oliphaunt can continuously change the environment around it, as control weather with a 5-mile radius. The Oliphaunt can change the weather to that of any season, and the effects manifest 1 round thereafter. If the Oliphaunt creates stormy weather, it can call down one lightning bolt per round as a free action, as if using call lightning storm.

Description

Only once did the Oliphaunt of Jandelay set foot on Golarion. A runelord of Thassilon, a precursor of Karzoug, had the knowledge to call the creature, and the ambition and ego to do so despite the risks. He erected the Spindlehorn, a slender tower of dark slate thousands of feet tall, in the Wyvern Mountains simply so he could look the Oliphaunt in the eye and attempt to control it. And control it he did.

The Oliphaunt caused the carnage the runelord intended, destroying an invading army from Azlant. Black clouds sprang from a clear sky around the mountain of a creature, and lightning and hail shot down on the amassed troops. Every impact of the thing's foot shook the ground, and the thunder of the Oliphaunt's march through the armies drowned out even the screams of the dying thousands. A massive valley marked the path where the Oliphaunt trod, with entire cities lying buried underneath the earth by the crushing footfalls.

But even a runelord couldn't control such power forever, and the wards protecting the Oliphaunt continued to draw it back to its home realm of Jandelay. The legion following the runelord's ally, Runelord Xanderghul, suffered the parting punishment when the Oliphaunt vanished, torn back to Jandelay. A quarter of Xanderghul's legion froze still in their tracks, then were ripped apart by chaotic, bloody storms and repeated earthquakes left in the Oliphaunt's wake.

In spite of the repercussions of calling the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, spellcasters of great influence and arrogance still attempt to recreate the singular feat of calling it to Golarion. Desperation drives most who try, most notably the Runelord Alaznist, who was prepared to call the beast down upon Karzoug as he prepared to finally march on her territory. Only Earthfall cut Alaznist's plans short.

Since the fall of the runelords and Thassilon, lore about the Oliphaunt and Jandelay has become much harder to come by-but it's far from forgotten. Ancient liches still work away in secluded laboratories to recreate the complicated means that once before called forth the great Oliphaunt, meticulously reconstructing what few scraps of ancient records they can find. Speculators collect all sorts of relics purported to be chunks of tusk that sloughed off the beast, vials of water collected from lakes formed by the Oliphaunt's tears, and all manner of other curiosities. Few eyewitness accounts remain, since most who saw the Oliphaunt died.

Few alive on Golarion even know about the Oliphaunt, but even fewer understand what Jandelay itself is. Some believe it's the name of the person who first scribed a tale of the Oliphaunt, others think it's an even greater progenitor beast that spawned the creature. Those who-ve deeply researched to topic found only a few hints. The most compelling of these are within the epic poem Jandelay, as inscribed at the base of the Spindlehorn. The poem tells of the Oliphaunt's rampage and the other legendary acts of the runelord who summoned it (though lacking specific details of how the runelord pulled off this feat). However, within the poem is a cipher that when translated reveals these words:

Jandelay, proof against the Maelstrom,
Jandelay, of green fields and faultless spires;
No sane soul born dares trespass fair Jandelay
For the Oliphaunt guards you always.
