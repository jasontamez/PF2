Description

An elohim is a strange being obsessed with creating miniature worlds populated with creatures of its choosing. It creates new permanent demiplanes or alters remote environments in pre-existing planes, seeds them with new life, then eventually abandons them. An elohim might return to its creation decades or centuries later to observe how its progeny have fared, and might allow them to continue or eradicate them completely. Elohim communicate with other beings only rarely, and always in a cryptic fashion.
