Rat Plague Swarm - Mythic Monsters








Plague Swarm, Rat Plague Swarm

Sent down by vengeful deities to punish communities that have offended them, plague swarms scour crops, terrorize populations, and lay waste to civilized lands. Normal means of dealing with vermin and pestilence don't drive them off, for these vicious and intelligent mythic swarms carry the destructive blessings of their gods, and breed at an exceptional rate until their spawn consume entire cities. They are single-minded in their devotion to carrying out the furious will of their deities.

Special Abilities

Curse of Lycanthropy (Su) A humanoid of any size who takes
damage from a plague rat swarm must succeed at a DC 19
Fortitude save or it contracts lycanthropy and becomes a
wererat. Any humanoid who contracts lycanthropy from a rat
plague swarm becomes immune to bubonic plague.

Disease (Ex) Bubonic Plague: Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 19;
onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage,
1 Cha damage, and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves.

Hivemind (Su) A plague rat swarm can maintain constant
telepathic communication with every wererat it created with
its curse of lycanthropy as long as they are on the same plane.
These wererats have an attitude of helpful toward the swarm.

Reform (Su) A rat plague swarm can be destroyed only if a
mythic spellcaster (or a non-mythic spellcaster who succeeds
at a DC 31 caster level check) affects it with remove disease
on the round before the swarm is dispersed. This condition
bypasses a swarm's normal immunity to single-target effects.

Special Abilities

Blight (Su) Plague swarms deal additional untyped damage equal to their standard swarm damage. This damage originates from divine power, similar to the spell <a href="spelldisplay58a3.html?ItemName=flame%20strike">flame strike</a>. A plague swarm's damage counts as magic and epic for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.

Multiply (Ex) Plague swarms spawn at an incredible rate. Once per minute, a plague swarm can produce a new swarm of the type listed in its stat block as full-round action. When the plague swarm is not in combat, it typically uses this ability once per minute. If the plague swarm is destroyed, all of the swarms that it spawned also disperse.

Reform (Su) When a plague swarm is dispersed by damage, it is not destroyed. A dispersed plague swarm reforms in 24 hours. Each plague swarm has a unique destruction condition. In addition, because plague swarms are manifestations of divine retribution, placating the deity's rage destroys the swarm instantly.
