Special Abilities

Immunity to Scorpion Venom (Ex) Meerkats are immune to the poison of all scorpions.

Mob (Ex) If two meerkats in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.

Description

Meerkats are playful, highly social animals that hunt and forage during the day. They live in complex burrow systems consisting of numerous access holes, chambers, and tunnels. Their diet consists of eggs, fruit, insects, larvae, lizards, rodents, and scorpions. Using a wide range of sounds, they communicate and warn one another about threats, banding together in a mob when they need to defend themselves. Meerkats can live more than 10 years.

A meerkat weighs around 2 pounds and is about 1 foot tall when standing upright.
