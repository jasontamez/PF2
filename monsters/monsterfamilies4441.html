The trappings of strange cultures and jealous mystics, isolated natives and sinister beliefs, idols symbolize the might of enigmatic and often bloody faiths. As the focus of cultish tribes and mysterious religions, crude icons occasionally come to express a measure of true power, transforming religious ardor offered through centuries of worship or the magic of inscrutable priests into not just supernatural properties, but actual life. Such idols thus become manifestations of self-fulfilling beliefs, servants to zealots, and miniature gods to the blindly devout.

While the abilities of an idol are tied intrinsically to the magic and materials from which it is made, all idols constantly radiate moderate magical auras and possess the following special abilities:

Inanimate (Ex) An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints-magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.'suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves.

Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).

Skills In addition to the challenge of detecting a stationary idol, these constructs gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks made to hide amid the materials that comprise their bodies.
