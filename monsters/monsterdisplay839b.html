Special Abilities

Immortal (Ex) Shabti do not age naturally
and can't die of old age. While some might
come into being at age categories other than
adulthood, they never leave their original age categories.
Spells and effects that cause aging affect a shabti as normal.

Immune to Undeath (Ex) Shabti can't become undead. Spells
and abilities that would transform a shabti into an undead
creature have no effect.
Past-Life Knowledge (Ex) Shabti remember bits of their past
lives. As a result, they treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.

Resist Level Drain (Ex) A shabti takes no penalties from
energy drain effects, though it can still be killed if it accrues
more negative levels than it has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any
negative levels a shabti takes are automatically removed
without the need for additional saving throws.

Shattered Soul (Ex) Shabti who are killed are exceptionally
difficult to return to life. Anyone who attempts to return a
shabti to life using raise dead, resurrection, or a similar spell
must succeed at a caster level check whose DC is equal to
10 + the shabti's Hit Dice. If it fails, the spell fails and the
caster can't return the shabti to life for the next 24 hours
(though the caster can try again after this period).

Description

Shabti are facsimiles of wealthy or powerful mortals seeking
to escape judgement for their sins upon death. Grown from
broken bits of mortal souls, shabti endure whatever cosmic
punishments or labor might await their creators in the
afterlife unless they're discovered and freed by psychopomps.
Shabti typically look like idealized humans with perfect
physiques and flawless features. They
usually stand 6 feet tall and weigh
around 175 pounds.
