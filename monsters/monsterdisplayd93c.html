Urannag - Monsters







Urannag

What at first appeared to be a sadistic spiked cage writhes into unholy life, extending bladed, articulated arms.

Special Abilities

Encage (Ex) As a swift action, an urannag can encage a
creature that shares its space and is not aware of it or
a helpless creature it has entrapped. The target treats
the urannag's space as difficult terrain, and cannot
move out of that space unless it succeeds at a DC 22
Reflex save. Each round a creature remains encaged,
it takes 2d6 points of slashing damage. A creature
can try to escape by attempting a combat maneuver
check or Escape Artist check (DC = the urannag's CMD)
as a full-round action, or it can try to smash through a
cage wall. These walls have an Armor Class of 22,
hardness 10, and 22 hit points. A wall with a
hole smashed in it automatically repairs itself.
The save DC is Strength-based.

Exposed Mechanisms (Ex) Although an
urannag is a construct, it can be harmed
by the methods used to disable traps.
A successful DC 20 Disable Device check
targeting an urannag (a full-round action that
provokes an attack of opportunity) deals damage that bypasses
the urannag's DR equal to 3d6 + the character's total ranks in
Disable Device. Additionally, the urannag is staggered for 1
round (DC 16 Fortitude negates the staggered condition).

Living Trap (Ex) Defensive abilities that apply to traps (such as
trap sense) apply against an urannag's attacks.

Description

Urannags have long vexed scholars, some of whom contend
that they're creatures, while others argue that they're complex
traps. In truth, they're both-an unsettling example of how
reality on the Abyss doesn't match mortal expectations. An
urannag behaves like an ambush predator, yet has no need for
sustenance and is driven to flense prey out of innate sadism.
