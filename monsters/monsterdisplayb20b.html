Description

The behemoth hippopotamus is a true monster. Standing taller than an elephant, this animal has few enemies in the natural world-even dinosaurs and dire crocodiles avoid fights with them. Making them even more dangerous is the fact that they are practically carnivores-while not above eating plant matter, they devour carrion or foolish creatures that come too close.
