Edimmu - Monsters







Edimmu

A flickering ghostly form soaring upon a front of roiling storm clouds, its skeletal torso lies cloaked in tattered wrappings. Powerful winds seem to lash about the spectre, and malevolent embers flare within its eye sockets as its claw-like fingerbones reach forth.

Special Abilities

Frigid Touch (Su) An edimmu's frigid touch deals 1d6 points of cold damage.

Life Implosion (Su) Once an edimmu reaches 0 hit points it collapses upon itself, imploding with a final shriek that rips the life force from nearby creatures. Any living being within 20 feet of the edimmu at the time of its destruction must succeed a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The save is Charisma-based.

Moan (Su) An edimmu's sorrowful moans force every living creature within 30 feet to make a DC 14 Will save to avoid becoming shaken. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same ediummu's moan for 24 hours. The save is Charisma-based.

Rejuvenation (Su) Upon an edimmu's destruction, the magics that bind it to the mortal world linger on. Thus, 1d4+1 days after an edimmu's destruction, the creature reforms with full hit points. The only way to destroy an edimmu is with an atonement spell. The atonement absolves the creature of its sins and sorrows, allowing it to finally return to its native plane.

Storm Mastery (Su) Once per day, an edimmu can spend a fullround action to control the winds within 50 feet of it. It may change the speed and strength of the wind within this area, raising wind force to as strong as severe (see page 95 of the DMG for details on wind effects). It may control such winds for up to 1 minute, but can perform no other action while doing so. At the end of this minute, or when the edimmu takes another action, the force of the winds reduces by one level of strength per round until returning to normal.

Weaknesses If dismissal is cast upon an edimmu, it is immediately destroyed without its life implosion ability taking effect.

Description

Edimmus rise from the corpses of slain genies unable to return to their elemental homelands. Whether through powerful magics or as part of bargains made with mortal spellcasters, genies occasionally find themselves tied to the Material Plane for a specific term or until they complete a set task. As the conditions of some such magics remain binding even in death, genies that perish before the terms of their service are fulfilled sometimes manifest as creatures of uncontrolled fury. Even in their undead state, these genies still possess a measure of their mastery over the elements, using their powers to seek revenge upon those who led them to be trapped to their horrifying forms.

Edimmus are ghostly, with ancient-looking, hunched skeletal frames that make them appear shorter than their average 6-foot heights.
