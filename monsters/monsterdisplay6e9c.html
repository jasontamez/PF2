Vescavor Swarm - Monsters







Vescavor Swarm

With a gibbering chorus, hundreds of toothy insects swarm together,
their heads nothing more than maws filled with a sickly green glow.

Special Abilities

Gibber (Su) Vescavors yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss.
Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor swarm or inside
it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be confused for 1
round. This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion. A creature
that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor swarm's
gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.
Ravenous (Ex) Vescavors can devour nearly anything. If
the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors
ignore its hardness if it is made of any substance other
than adamantine. Additionally, every round that a creature
is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin
devouring one object on the creature-if the vescavor
swarm is not under the control of a vescavor queen, refer to
Pathfinder Core Rulebook 216 Table 9-2. Once the vescavors
choose an item in this way, they continue to devour that
same item until it is destroyed. The object takes half its
maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken
condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken
condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can
make a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC
is Constitution-based.
Traumatizing (Su) Enduring the presence of a vescavor swarm
is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature
that spends more than 3 consecutive rounds inside a
vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or gain
one of the types of madness presented on page 250 of the
Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide. Roll on the Types of
Insanity table to determine which type of insanity affects
the creature. Despite each entry listing a DC, the creature
does not receive an additional Will save to prevent the
insanity. This affliction is permanent, but can be healed as
detailed in the Curing Insanity section of the Sanity and
Madness rules. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Description

Once found only in the lightless crevices and shrieking
half-live jungles of the Abyss, the yammering, gluttonous
vermin of the Abyss called vescavors crawl through
portals into the Material Plane to feed and spawn. Ruled
by enormous, hideous queens who direct their swarms
in finding food and destroying foes with the help of
pheromones and mental commands, vescavor swarms
devour objects, creatures, and structures alike. Their
hunger is insatiable and carries with it the terrors of the
Abyss itself, warping the minds of even those creatures
who escape the vescavors' maws. Only adamantine can
endure their gnashing teeth, and a swarm of vescavors
that descends upon a settlement devours everything and
leaves nothing behind.
