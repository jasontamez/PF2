Special Abilities

Poison (Su) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 28, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d4 Con drain, cure 2 consecutive saves.

Soul Rend (Su) If a deathsnatcher hits a single creature with two or more claw attacks in 1 round, it deals an additional 1d8+13 points of damage to the creature. For every claw attack that hits beyond the first, the soul rend inflicts 1 negative level. The deathsnatcher regains 5 hit points per negative level inflicted. After 24 hours have passed, a negative level can be removed with a successful DC 26 Fortitude save.

Swift Spawning (Su) When a deathsnatcher kills via negative levels, negative energy damage, or a death effect, the body immediately rises as an advanced bodak (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 292, 48) under the deathsnatcher's control.

Description

Deathsnatchers dwell amid the ruins of fallen civilizations, where they play at being godlings worshiped by undead slaves. Though self-aggrandizing, deathsnatchers are known to give homage to (and claim descent from) the various demon lords of darkness, the desert, and undeath.

A deathsnatcher is 6 feet tall and weighs 280 pounds.
