Description

Before Alaznist created the first <a href="monsterdisplay89d8.html?ItemName=Sinspawn">sinspawn</a> through the use of her runewell, she experimented with several techniques to create sin-twisted servants. One foundation of the complex magical technique used to create sinspawn was known as runewarping. Through the use of runewarping, Alaznist and other powerful mages created horribly twisted creatures from their slaves and prisoners. These creators valued ability over aesthetics, so runewarped creatures were transformed by powerful magic into horrid mockeries of their previous forms. Runewarped creatures seek out sources of magic to consume, trying in vain to complete their transformation. Although a runewarped creature is recognizable as the creature it once was, the creature bears altered or additional limb joints, elongated fingers, and a massive jaw capable of delivering a powerful bite.

Ecology

Runewarped creatures are not tied to a particular sin. They cannot detect any specific emanations of sin, but they instead sniff out magic and magical abilities. A runewarped creature constantly searches for magical energy in hopes of completing its unfinished transformation-a futile effort due to the incomplete nature of runewarping. When a runewarped creature locates a source of magic, such as a magic item or a spellcaster, it attempts to consume it. Runewarped creatures gnaw on magical items, worrying at them until they are wholly destroyed. A runewarped creature's bite siphons away the magical abilities of creatures capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities. If a runewarped creature kills such a creature, it often drags the body away to consume it entirely.

No matter how much it gluts itself on magic, a runewarped creature can never sate its hunger. The unstable magic resonating through the runewarped creature disrupts any consumed magic and dissipates it without any benefit to the runewarped creature.

A runewarped creature is not immortal and must still eat and drink as normal, but runewarping grants an incredibly long lifespan-a few runewarped creatures from the days of ancient Thassilon still lurk in isolated subterranean dungeons. When exposed to ongoing sources of rune magic, such as an active runewell, these extraordinarily old runewarped creatures sometimes transform into something more twisted and powerful, able to expend their consumed energy as spell-like abilities. Known as sinwarped, these creatures are living embodiments of sin magic.

Habitat and Society

Although the exact means of creating runewarped creatures was lost to Earthfall, creatures still occasionally find themselves twisted by runewarping magic. Creatures exposed to aberrant energies in Alaznist's ancient laboratories, or who spend prolonged periods near residual echoes of such energies, find their flesh twisting and their minds wracked with the magical hunger that runewarping creates. Hidden chambers within Hollow Mountain have warped many unaware explorers in this way. Runewarped creatures created in this manner tend to adopt the source of their affliction as their home, exhibiting a fierce territoriality.

Runewarped creatures might work together to share resources, set traps, or plan thefts, although their constant hunger usually makes such alliances short lived. Some runewarped creatures subjugate groups of lesser creatures, such as morlocks or goblins, sending them out to kidnap spellcasters to feed their magical hunger.

Creating a Runewarped Creature

"Runewarped creature" is an acquired template that can be added to any animal, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A runewarped creature uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: Base creature's CR + 1.

Alignment: Any evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to aberration. Do not recalculate its base attack bonus, saves, or skill ranks.

Senses: The creature gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet, low-light vision, and magic-scent.

Magic-Scent (Su): Runewarped creatures have scent that detects only creatures with the ability to cast spells. This scent allows the runewarped creature to know the location and power of all magic auras within range of its scent. Magic-scent always detects magic auras in a range of 60 feet and is not affected by wind.

Armor Class: Natural armor bonus increases by 2.

Hit Dice: Change all the creature's racial Hit Dice to d8s. Hit Dice derived from class levels remain unchanged.

Defensive Abilities: A runewarped creature with 5 Hit Dice or more gains DR 5/magic (or DR 10/magic if it has 11 Hit Dice or more) and SR equal to its new CR + 6 (or SR equal to its new CR + 11 if it has 11 Hit Dice or more).

Melee: A runewarped creature gains a bite attack that deals damage based on the runewarped creature's size but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. If the runewarped creature already has a bite attack, the bite's damage increases by one step, as if it had increased one size category.

Special Attacks: A runewarped creature loses any spells or spell-like abilities, but it retains all other special attacks and abilities of the base creature. A runewarped creature gains the following special attack.

Consume Magic (Su): A runewarped creature's bite drains magical ability from creatures capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities. The struck creature loses its highest-level prepared spell, spell slot, or spell-like ability unless it succeeds at a Will save to negate the effect. A creature can be affected by this ability only once per round, even if attacked multiple times or by multiple runewarped creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Ability Scores: Str +4, Con +2, Int -4 (minimum 1), Cha -2.

Sinwarped Creatures

Runewarped creatures subjected to prolonged direct exposure to a runewell or sin magic gain additional powers related to a specific sin, seeking out magic and spellcasters associated with that sin.

Sinwarped creatures are runewarped creatures with the advanced creature simple template, magic-scent with a range of 120 feet, and spell-like abilities determined by the creature's affinity to a particular school of sin magic: envy (<a href="spelldisplaydcdb.html?ItemName=resist%20energy">resist energy</a> and <a href="spelldisplay01c1.html?ItemName=shield">shield</a>), gluttony (<a href="spelldisplay1e46.html?ItemName=chill%20touch">chill touch</a> and <a href="spelldisplaycade.html?ItemName=false%20life">false life</a>), greed (<a href="spelldisplay5fff.html?ItemName=barkskin">barkskin</a> and <a href="spelldisplayb085.html?ItemName=expeditious%20retreat">expeditious retreat</a>), lust (<a href="spelldisplay9304.html?ItemName=hold%20person">hold person</a> and <a href="spelldisplayd175.html?ItemName=hypnotism">hypnotism</a>), pride (<a href="spelldisplay14e2.html?ItemName=blur">blur</a> and <a href="spelldisplayc403.html?ItemName=color%20spray">color spray</a>), sloth (<a href="spelldisplayb58c.html?ItemName=cure%20moderate%20wounds">cure moderate wounds</a> and <a href="spelldisplayf210.html?ItemName=grease">grease</a>), or wrath (<a href="spelldisplay3e9a.html?ItemName=burning%20hands">burning hands</a> and <a href="spelldisplay47a2.html?ItemName=darkness">darkness</a>). Each spell-like ability is usable once per day. When a target loses a prepared spell, spell slot, or spell-like ability that is at least 3rd level to a sinwarped creature's consume magic ability, the sinwarped creature regains all of these spell-like abilities it has used.
