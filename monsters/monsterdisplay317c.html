Special Abilities

Adoration (Ex) The first time each round a creature attempts to attack Arshea (whether with a melee attack, a ranged attack, or a spell), that creature must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or hesitate and waste the action (losing the spell or daily use, if applicable). If Arshea attacked that creature in the last round, the creature automatically succeeds at this Will save. Evil creatures gain a +10 bonus on this Will save. This is a mind affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Endless Dance (Ex) Arshea adds their Charisma bonus to all damage rolls with weapon attacks (this bonus is already calculated into their statistics above).

Flawless Form (Ex) Arshea exults in the body's full freedom of motion and the beauty of the physical form. Whenever wearing revealing clothing (or no clothing) and no armor, Arshea adds their Wisdom bonus as an insight bonus to their Armor Class and their Charisma bonus as a sacred bonus to their Armor Class (these bonuses are already calculated into their statistics above).

Freedom's Call (Ex) Arshea is immune to any effects that abrogate freedom, as if constantly under the effects of freedom.

Fulfillment (Su) Arshea instantly receives the full results of detect anxieties, detect desires, and detect thoughts on the first round of examining a creature. In addition to the creature's current desires, Arshea's detect desires reveals the creature's deepest underlying desires-those that would bring it true fulfillment if granted. If the creature's deepest desires are wicked or perverse in nature, Arshea also learns the creature's deepest nonharmful desire, if any, and whether its fulfillment might help the creature eschew the darkness constraining its heart. Arshea can produce an effect within the bounds of wish without spending a use of the daily spell-like ability, but only to help grant a creature fulfillment as determined by this ability, and only once per creature. Participating in a creature's fulfillment and release from needless constraints is a religious and often sexual experience for both parties involved. For 24 hours afterward, both Arshea and the fulfilled creature receive a +4 morale bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, as well as to caster level.

Nomadic (Ex) Arshea, unlike many empyreal lords, does not keep a static empyreal realm. Instead, Arshea is nomadic, traveling the wilds of Nirvana as they see fit. As a swift action once per day, Arshea can designate a region on Nirvana to serve as their territory-this region cannot include any area currently claimed by another empyreal lord or deity as part of a planar realm. The area of the territory can vary, but it never extends more than 100 miles from the point Arshea selected as the center of their territory. The next time Arshea uses this ability to generate a planar territory, it cannot overlap any region that served them as a planar territory within the previous 24 hours. Within this planar territory, Arshea enjoys the full benefits of an empyreal realm, as detailed on page 87 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4, including the ability to use mythic spell-like abilities and the mythic power ability.

Primal Aura (Su) Creatures within Arshea's primal aura must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with euphoria. On a successful save, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against emotion-based effects while remaining within Arshea's primal aura, but it is immune to further effects from the primal aura for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature becomes dazed for 1 round from overwhelming sensations in addition to the -2 penalty on all saving throws against emotion-based effects. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Unlimited Abandon (Su) All of Arshea's mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and extraordinary abilities affect all creatures, regardless of those creatures' immunity to charms, compulsions, emotion effects, or mind-affecting effects. A mythic or deific creature with such an immunity still loses its immunity, but gains a +4 bonus on its saving throws against these effects and can roll twice and then choose the best result.

Description

Arshea is known as the embodiment of irrepressible passion and exultation, and is also named among mortals as the Spirit of Abandon and the Host of Delectation. Their unique form combines the most attractive traits of both femininity and masculinity'seen as such not only by members of the human race, but by those of any species that have an encounter with the empyreal lord. The empyreal lord is of both genders and neither, unfettered by such distinctions. Arshea has no personal realm, instead journeying throughout the celestial realms and the mortal world unpredictably, trailing a wake of beauty, freedom, and sensuality

Arshea's Faith

Arshea is the angelic patron of freedom, physical beauty,
and sexuality, and their worshipers include artisans,
courtesans, some fey, and those seeking to escape
repression. Arsheans often follow in their deity's footsteps
and spend significant time experiencing life as every
gender and sexuality, experimenting in order to overcome
their preconceptions and ensure they each express their
truest identity.

Arshea's holy symbol is a reclining figure draped in
multicolored sashes, and their favored weapon is the flail.
The Spirit of Abandon grants access to the domains of Charm,
Good, Liberation, and Strength, and to the subdomains of
Agathion, Freedom, Love, and Lust.

The empyreal lords are the primal forces of good given physical form. Though not as powerful as gods, they are ancient celestials with legendary abilities.

Unlike many other beings of demigod-level power, empyreal lords do not divide themselves as strictly along racial lines-the term "empyreal lord" names the greatest members of the agathion, angel, archon, and azata races. While demon lords, archdevils, horsemen, and similar unique beings orchestrate the plots of their race alone- proving either unwilling or too fractious to collaborate with those not of their kind-empyreal lords seek out the commonalities of interest and purpose shared by their peers among the other celestial races. Although some goodaligned planar races have their own titles for the greatest of their kind, the title "empyreal lord" serves as a unifying bond between forces for good. Though their foes (and even some allies) see these mightiest azatas, angels, agathions, and archons as rulers of their kind, the empyreal lords do not consider themselves royalty. Together the empyreal lords marshal the efforts of all goodly outsiders toward common ends.

Some empyreal lords are almost as old as creation itself, having arisen from the ranks of the first celestials. Others were imbued with divine grace, either by being champions of a deity, inheriting the power of a slain god, or tapping into remarkable powers gathered at far-flung corners of the planes. Some reached this high station by performing impossible quests, gaining the favor of fate, or becoming perfectly attuned with one of the good outer planes.

Representing the two poles of goodness and the fulcrum upon which they balance, the empyreal lords do not always agree, but generally do not interfere with each others' decisions. Most view philosophical squabbles as petty when faced with a common foe, and never has infighting threatened the foundation of their bonds. Thus, while their outlooks may differ regarding freedom, individuality, and loyalty, the empyreal lords do not allow such differences to stand in the way of vanquishing evil-they're celestials aligned against evil first and foremost.

Despite their power, the empyreal lords typically eschew direct involvement in the affairs of mortals and even most other celestials. They believe the greater objectives of good are ultimately served by larger and fartherreaching orchestrations of diplomacy and subtle strategy. Even though their powers might not always obviously be directly at work, empyreal lords court mortal worshipers who share their goals and ideals, who are typically referred to as mystery cultists. Rather than more general goals like good or order, mystery cultists focus their worship on the ideals, activities, and creatures their patron most fervently extols or openly favors.

Empyreal Realms

An empyreal lord's planar realm may be as small as a metropolis or as large as a continent. The realms' environments, themes, and traits are as unusual as the empyreal lords themselves, presenting surreal challenges and dangers to creatures seeking to invade them.

An empyreal lord gains the following additional powers while in its realm (the statistics presented on the following pages do not include these abilities). <ul><li>Mythic: An empyreal lord functions as a 10th mythic rank creature, including the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). It may expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic versions of any spell-like ability denoted with an asterisk (*) just as if the ability were a mythic spell.</li><li>Use of the following spell-like abilities at will-demand, discern location, fabricate, and major creation.</li><li>Use of the following spell-like abilities once per day- dimensional lock*, miracle (limited to physical effects that manipulate the realm or to effects that are relevant to the empyreal lord's areas of concern), power word stun*.</li><li>Heightened Awareness (Ex): An empyreal lord gains a +10 insight bonus on Perception and Initiative checks.</li></ul>

Other Empyreal Lords

Although the three presented here are among most powerful of the empyreal lords, they are far from the only celestials to bear this title. Among the ranks of the good races of the heavens stand those that are great leaders of their kind and shining examples to other celestials. For these few, their natures or their actions kindle a transformation that reshapes them into empyreal lords-a superlative version of their basic form. When they ascend, these empyreal lords are given an honorific typically celebrating their deeds or honoring another empyreal lord of similar distinction. Below are many ascendant celestials that have become empyreal lords and their honored titles.
