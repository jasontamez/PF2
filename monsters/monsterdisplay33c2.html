<td>Desert Vermin, Giant Walking Stick

What at first appears to be a spindly, dead tree suddenly crawls from its camouflage, its wiry antenna twitching in the air.

Special Abilities

Nauseating Spray (Ex) A walking stick can spray a 15-foot cone of irritating, foul-smelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. Creatures within this area must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or be sickened for 5 rounds. Alternatively, the walking stick can target a single creature within 30 feet with a stream of this fluid. To use this version of its nauseating spray, the walking stick must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most walking sticks). If the target is hit, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Description

More common in rocky badlands than the great sandy dunes, stick bugs of all sizes are often mistaken for the fallen palm fronds or thorny leaf less trees found near oases and other spots in the desert where vegetation grows. Giant walking sticks often remain motionless for days at a time, waiting for the right prey to pass by before striking. When engaged with a foe too difficult to overtake, giant walking sticks flee from the fight. They usually expel their nauseating spray in these situations, but some can even break off their own limbs in order to escape, regrowing the missing arm or leg later once they're safe.

A fully grown giant walking stick stretches from 6 to 10 feet long, but typically weighs only 120 pounds.
