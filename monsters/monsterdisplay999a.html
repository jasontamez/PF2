Description

Khalirai, the Ivory Queen, is one
of the most powerful nymphs in
the Mwangi Expanse. Protecting
her exotic ward, known in local
myths as the Ivory Boneyard,
Khalirai is mysterious even by
nymphs' standards. In mimicry
of her surroundings, she has
bone-white skin-a rarity among
nymphs of the region-and she
possesses long, lustrous black hair and deep
green almond-shaped eyes. She has taken to
wearing ivory jewelry that she crafts from the
tusks of the fallen elephants that travel here at
the ends of their lives to rejoin their ancestors in
her ward. The Ivory Boneyard has had a great impact
on her, and she is a dark, brooding soul, but with a soft
spot for the sick and ill, and often heals those who are
brave enough to come into her ward. While she protects
the elephant graveyard from external threats, she holds
it as her solemn duty to keep undead at bay, especially
those arising from the ward itself.

Many years ago, Khalirai fell in lust with a young
Mwangi man, and has served as his muse ever since. It
has been many years since then, and her love is old and
frail; soon she will need to find a new bard to inspire.
