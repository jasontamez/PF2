Special Abilities

Disease (Ex) Any weapon a gibrileth wields becomes a vector for
spreading the demonplague. A creature bitten by a gibrileth
or damaged by a weapon it wields is exposed to this virulent
disease. A successful DC 22 Fortitude save is needed to resist
this creature's particular strain of demonplague-full details
on this widespread sickness appear on page 29. The save DC
is Constitution-based.

Tumors (Su) As a swift action, a gibrileth can rip a grapefruitsized
tumor from its body with one of its many arms and
throw it as a splash weapon with a range increment of
20 feet. A direct hit deals 2d6 points of acid damage, and
deals 1d4 points of acid splash damage to all creatures
within 5 feet of the target. A creature can avoid the splash
damage with a successful DC 22 Reflex save. The save DC is
Constitution-based.

Whip Specialist (Ex) A gibrileth does not provoke attacks of
opportunity when using a whip.

Description

Gibrileths are known as filth demons because their
appearance is so vile that even other demons find them
appalling-including some hezrous. A gibrileth's body is
composed almost entirely of quivering,
globular, acidic tumors, save for its batlike
wings and the nest of spindly, atrophied
arms growing from the top of its body. It
can walk with a clumsy gait, using its long
arms, but it prefers to be on the wing.
These creatures enjoy spreading
nausea and sickness, either
via their spell-like abilities or
through violence-in fact, they
are one of the primary sources
of demonplague throughout
the Worldwound. Gibrileths
particularly relish the taste
of partially liquefied,
diseased flesh, and many
keep infected victims
in pens like cattle for
periodic snacking, allowing
their sickness to season them
properly before feeding. Gibrileths
rise from the souls of mortals who
deliberately encourage the spread of
disease or sickness, many of whom died
of disease themselves.

A gibrileth is approximately 10 feet in
diameter, with a wingspan of 16 feet. These
foul, bloated demons typically weigh about
2,400 pounds.

Demons exist for one reason-to destroy. Where their more lawful counterparts, the devils of Hell, seek to twist mortal minds and values to remake and reshape them into reflections of their own evil, demons seek only to maim, ruin, and feed. They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy-for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon's depredations and flee to his just reward in the afterlife. It is the prolonging of mortal pain and suffering that fuels a demon's lusts and desires, for it is partially from mortal sin and cruelty that these monstrous fiends were born.

Demons are the most prolific and among the most destructive of the fiendish races, yet despite what some lore might preach, they were not the first forms of life to rise in the stinking pits of ruin and cruelty known across the multiverse as the Abyss. Before the first fledgling deity gazed upon reality, before mortal life drew its breath, before even the Material Plane itself had fully formed, the Abyss was infested with life.

Known to many scholars as "proto-demons," these wretched and deadly beings were the qlippoth. Today, because of the influence of sinful mortal souls upon the Abyss, mixed with unholy tamperings at the hands of the daemonic keepers of Abaddon and the cruel whims of fate and evolution, the rule of the qlippoth has receded. The proto-demons dwell now in the noxious and forgotten corners of the Abyss, and the far more fecund and prolific demons rule now in their stead. With each evil mortal soul that finds its way into the Abyss, the ranks of the demonic hordes grows-a single soul can fuel the manifestation of dozens or even hundreds of demons, with the exact nature of the sins carried by the soul guiding the shapes and roles of the newly formed fiends.

The Abyss is a vast (some say infinite) realm, far larger than any other plane save possibly the primal chaos of the Maelstrom itself. As befits such a vast and varied realm, the demonic host is likewise diverse. Some carry in their frames humanoid shapes, while others are twisted beasts. Some flop on land while others flap in air or sea. Some are schemers and manipulators of emotion and politics, others are destructive engines of ruin. Yet all demons work to the same goal-pain and suffering for mortal life in all its forms.

Yet despite this, mortals have sought demonic aid since the start. Be it an instinctual draw to self-destruction or a misguided lust for power, conjurers to this day continue to draw forth demons with forbidden magic. Some conjure demons for lore, while others call upon them to serve as assassins or guards. Demons view such summoners with a mix of hatred and thanks, for most demons lack the ability to come to the Material Plane to wreak havoc on their own. They depend on the mad to call them up from the Abyss, and while they gnash their fangs and rail against the commands and strictures enforced, most demons find ways to twist their summoners' demands so that even the most tightly controlled demonic slave leaves a trace of ruin and despair in its wake. More often than not, a foolish spellcaster makes a fatal mistake in the conjuring and pays for it with blood, unwittingly releasing a terrible blight upon the world as his conjuration breaks free of his control.

The truly mad call upon demons to offer themselves, both body and soul, in the misguided belief that alliance with the demonic can buy salvation and protection when the demonic apocalypse finally comes to call. Tales of desperate kings who sought to engage demons to serve as generals for their armies or of lunatics who seek demonic sires to gift them with horrific children are common enough, yet worst are those mortals who worship the most powerful demons as gods, and who pledge their lives in support of that which would bring destruction to all.
