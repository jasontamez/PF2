Counterpoised creatures dwell in the Outer Planes where balance between elements or ideologies is paramount, but they can be summoned using spells such as summon monster and planar ally. A counterpoised creature's CR increases by 1 only if the base creature has 5 or more Hit Dice. A counterpoised creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same.

Rebuild Rules: Senses gains darkvision 60 ft.; Defensive Abilities gains DR and energy resistance as noted on the table; SR gains SR equal to new CR +5; Special Attacks smite bias 1/day as a swift action (adds Cha bonus to attack rolls and damage bonus equal to HD against a foe that is chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, or lawful good; smite persists until the target is dead or the counterpoised creature rests). <table class="inner"><tr><td>Hit Dice</td><td>Resist Cold, Electricity, and Fire</td><td>DR</td></tr> <tr><td>1-4</td><td>5</td><td>-</td></tr> <tr><td>5-10</td><td>10</td><td>5/adamantine</td></tr> <tr><td>11+</td><td>15</td><td>10/adamantine</td></tr></table>
