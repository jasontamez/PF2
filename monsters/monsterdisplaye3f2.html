Special Abilities

Immunity to Magic (Ex) A quintessence golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. <ul><li>- A plane shift spell allows the golem's DR to be bypassed by an aligned weapon (evil, chaos, good, or law; determined randomly) for 2d4 rounds, with no save.</li> <li>- A resurrection or true resurrection spell negates a quintessence golem's energy drain and soul siphon abilities for 2d4 rounds. When cast in this way, resurrection and true resurrection do not require expensive material components.</li></ul>

Powerful Blows (Ex) A quintessence golem adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage rolls for its slam attacks.

Soul Infused (Ex) A quintessence golem's animating spark is provided by the flow of souls through it into the Outer Planes and by the potential for life inherent in all quintessence, rather than an imprisoned elemental spirit. As a result, a quintessence golem, while not technically alive, does modify its hit points with its Charisma modifier. These hit points are already calculated into its statistics.

Soul Siphon (Su) If any creature within 100 feet of a quintessence golem is reduced to negative hit points, it is immediately slain as its spirit is sent on to the afterlife due to the golem's proximity. Whenever a creature is slain in this way, the quintessence golem regains 100 hit points and gains the effects of haste for 1 round.

Description

Quintessence is the raw material that makes up all matter and life found on the Outer Planes. With its infinite potential for shape and state, it should come as no surprise that raw quintessence makes an outstanding material (in terms of both quality and price) for the construction of golems. A quintessence golem is among the greatest creations a mortal spellcaster can craft-while not technically alive, the quintessence golem is made of material that aches to live, trapped in a metaphysical state between mortal and immortal life. The quintessence that makes up these golems actually acts as a siphon of sorts that encourages souls to shed their mortal frame and slip into the soulstream to seek their judgment in the afterlife. This fact makes these golems particularly dangerous and quite well suited for the guardianship of powerful temples or graveyards.

Construction

A quintessence golem is built from raw, fresh quintessence harvested at great expense from remote corners of the Outer Planes. This material costs no less than 150,000 gp in total.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They stand apart from other constructs in the nature of their animating force-golems are granted their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the will of the golem's creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of another, but the golem's creator can always resume control by commanding the golem to obey him alone.


Constructing a Golem

The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components used in its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the materials required and the total cost for its creation.

Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. Building a golem with the advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.


Shield Guardians

A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the golem's construction-a completed golem cannot later be "upgraded" to function as a shield guardian.

Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so). If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.

Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base golem, but with the following additional special qualities. A shield guardian's CR is equal to the base golem's CR + 2.

Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of its amulet is within 30 feet.

Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.

Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can locate the amulet's wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.

Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.

Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).

Construction: A shield guardian's base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem's cost. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem's kind. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time-it costs 20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian's total cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. The creator must have a minimum caster level of 2 higher than the base golem's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells are added to the base golem's requirements: discern location and either shield or shield other.
