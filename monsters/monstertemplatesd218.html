Infused with powerful psychic energy, enlightened constructs have access to strange and deadly mental powers. Highly intelligent and secretive, these constructs typically serve as henchmen to powerful psychics or sorcerous cabals.

"Enlightened construct" is an acquired template that can be added to any construct, referred to hereafter as the base creature. An enlightened construct retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Challenge Rating: If the base creature had 4 or fewer HD, base creature's CR + 1; HD 5-10, base creature's CR + 2; HD 11 or more, base creature's CR + 3.

Alignment: An enlightened construct's alignment is no more than one step away from that of its creator.

Type: An enlightened construct gains the augmented subtype.

Senses: An enlightened construct gains lifesense out to 60 feet.

Weaknesses: An enlightened construct gains the following weakness.

Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex): An enlightened construct is susceptible to mind-affecting effects, even though it is a construct. Although they can be magically charmed or compelled, enlightened constructs are particularly resistant to enchantments and receive a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist these effects.

Special Attacks: An enlightened construct gains the following special abilities.

Mind Thrust (Sp): An enlightened construct can use <a href="spelldisplaybbe9.html?ItemName=mind%20thrust">mind thrust</a> as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 2 + the enlightened construct's Intelligence modifier. The version of <a href="spelldisplaybbe9.html?ItemName=mind%20thrust">mind thrust</a> available to an enlightened construct is determined by its Hit Dice: HD Spell

Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): An enlightened construct gains a number of spell-like abilities set by its Hit Dice. It gains the spell-like abilities listed in the entry for its Hit Dice on the table below, as well as all listed spell-like abilities for prior entries. Unless otherwise noted, each ability is usable 1/day. The caster level for these abilities is equal to the enlightened construct's Hit Dice (or the caster level of the base construct's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher). The DC for a saving throw against the enlightened construct's spell-like ability is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the enlightened construct's Intelligence modifier.

Ability Scores: If the base creature had an Intelligence score of 9 or less, roll 2d6+4 to determine the enlightened construct's new Intelligence score. If the base creature had an Intelligence score of 10 or greater, increase its Intelligence score by 6. Additionally, increase the enlightened construct's Charisma score by 2d6.

Feats: Since it has an Intelligence score, an enlightened construct gains feats as normal for a creature of its Hit Dice.

Skills: An enlightened construct gains skill points according to its new Intelligence score, which are assigned appropriately for its function, as determined by the GM.

Languages: An enlightened construct speaks one language that its creator spoke, plus a number of additional languages that its creator knew equal to the enlightened construct's Intelligence bonus (if any). The enlightened construct can also communicate by telepathy up to a range of 100 feet.

Special Qualities: An enlightened construct gains the following special qualities.

Artificial Soul (Su): Though not the true soul of a living creature, the enlightened construct's artificial soul provides it with a unique personality and a spark of sentience. Unlike most constructs, the enlightened construct is not immune to necromantic effects. Enlightened constructs are still immune to death effects and they cannot be raised or resurrected. Enlightened construct golems are still immune to magic as described in their entries.

Phrenic Stone (Su): An enlightened construct has a stone infused with supernatural mental energy embedded into its head or chest that is the source of its awakened intellect. If an enlightened construct is destroyed but this phrenic stone remains intact, it can be used to create another enlightened construct, using the same cost as augmenting a new enlightened construct (see Construction below). When a phrenic stone is used to create a new enlightened construct, the personality and memories of the previous enlightened construct are lost. A phrenic stone has hardness 10, 20 hit points, and a break DC of 30.


Construction

An enlightened construct's phrenic stone and materials cost an additional 60,000 gp above the base creature's cost. The construct's master can assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The DC of the Craft check required to create the body is 10 higher than normal for the base creature. After the body is created, the enlightened construct is animated through a magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom that costs 1,000 gp to establish. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. If the creator is personally constructing the construct's body, the construction and the ritual can be performed simultaneously. The creator must have a minimum caster level 4 higher than the base construct's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells must be cast during the ritual: <a href="spelldisplay86ed.html?ItemName=awaken%20construct">awaken construct</a>, <a href="spelldisplay8498.html?ItemName=eagle%e2%80%99s%20splendor">eagle's splendor</a>, <a href="spelldisplay71ac.html?ItemName=greater%20possession">greater possession</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayef5a.html?ItemName=wish">wish</a>.
