Botfly Swarm - Monsters







Botfly, Botfly Swarm

Like a cloud of black dust, a swirling swarm of insects hovers in the air. From within comes the low, droning buzz of thousands of tiny flies.

Special Abilities

Infestation (Ex) A living creature injured by a botfly swarm's attack must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be infested with the swarm's larvae. The larvae may be cut out of the host with a DC 15 Heal check, though each attempt inflicts 1d8 points of damage whether or not it's successful. A cure disease spell destroys all larvae without further harm to the host.

Botfly larvae: infestation; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage.

Description

Common to sweltering jungles, warm swamplands, and lazy riverbanks, these pestilent f ly swarms seek humanoid hosts for their eggs. While not as physically dangerous as their giant cousins, implanted botf ly larvae typically carry diseases that spread to the host.

Infestations

Parasites such as botf ly larvae cause infestations, a type of aff liction similar to diseases. Infestations can only be cured through specific means; otherwise, no matter how many saving throws are made, the infestation continues to aff lict the target. While a remove disease spell (or similar effect) instantly halts an infestation, immunity to disease offers no protection, as the infestation itself is caused by parasites.
