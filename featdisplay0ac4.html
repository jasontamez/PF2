Although undead, you can easily pass as living.

Prerequisites: Ghoul, Cha 18.

Benefit: Your appearance is such that, while paleskinned and gaunt, you can pass as a living humanoid of your choice. You gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to appear human, and your channel resistance increases by +2. Ghasts with this feat can activate or suppress their stench ability as a free action.
