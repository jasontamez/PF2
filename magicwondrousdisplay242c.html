Description

This red and orange silk robe gives viewers the impression
of a flame roiling just below the fabric's slick surface. The
robe grants the wearer fire resistance 5 and increases the
wearer's caster level for all spells with the fire descriptor
by +1. Once per day on command, the wearer of the robe
can emit a 20-foot-radius burst of fire. Creatures other than
the wearer within the area take 2d6 points of fire damage
(Reflex DC 16 half).
