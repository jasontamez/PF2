Description

Pale blue when wet, ghost ink dries to near-transparency 1 minute after application. Ghost ink is used to subtly mark trails and locations. The pigment glows red under the light shed by fire beetle glands and sunrods; otherwise, a successful DC 25 Perception check is required to notice a mark in ghost ink. One vial of ghost ink is sufficient for writing a page's worth of characters.
