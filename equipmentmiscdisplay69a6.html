Description

This garment is specially designed to have a single spell scribed on the inside of its surface, hidden from prying eyes. Infiltrators and spies often use scroll belts to secure extra magical means of escape when the remainder of their equipment is taken during capture. The belt is reusable, though the normal costs and time required to scribe a spell on the belt for each new spell apply. You must remove the belt and hold it in a free hand in order to use the scroll.
