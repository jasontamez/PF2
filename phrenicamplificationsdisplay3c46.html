Will of the Dead - Phrenic Amplifications - Psychic







<a href="phrenicamplificationsdisplay3c46.html?ItemName=Will%20of%20the%20Dead">Will of the Dead</a> (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 62</a>): Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor.
