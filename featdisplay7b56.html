The animal's intervention completely protects its master from harm.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay977d.html?ItemName=Intercept%20Blow">Intercept Blow</a>, base attack bonus +6, animal companion.

Benefit: When the animal companion uses Intercept Blow to intercept an opponent's melee attack and succeeds, it can take all the damage from the intercepted attack, in which case its master takes no damage from the intercepted attack and doesn't suffer effects that trigger on a hit.
