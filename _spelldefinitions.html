<a href="spelldefinitionsdfb4.html?ID=1"></a>Abjuration

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Abjurations are protective spells. They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence.
If one abjuration spell is active within 10 feet of another for 24 hours or more, the magical fields interfere with each other and create barely visible energy fluctuations. The DC to find such spells with the Perception skill drops by 4.
If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures. If you force the barrier against such a creature, you feel a discernible pressure against the barrier. If you continue to apply pressure, you end the spell.

<a href="spelldefinitions1c06.html?ID=2"></a>Conjuration

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools. Conjurations transport creatures from another plane of existence to your plane (calling); create objects or effects on the spot (creation); heal (healing); bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or forms of energy to you (summoning); or transport creatures or objects over great distances (teleportation). Creatures you conjure usually-but not always-obey your commands.
A creature or object brought into being or transported to your location by a conjuration spell cannot appear inside another creature or object, nor can it appear f loating in an empty space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of supporting it.
The creature or object must appear within the spell's range, but it does not have to remain within the range.

<a href="spelldefinitionsdc08.html?ID=3"></a>Divination

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Divination spells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, predict the future, find hidden things, and foil deceptive spells.
Many divination spells have cone-shaped areas. These move with you and extend in the direction you choose. The cone defines the area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for multiple rounds, you can often gain additional information, as noted in the descriptive text for the spell.

<a href="spelldefinitions5ced.html?ID=4"></a>Enchantment

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. All enchantments are mind-affecting spells. Two subschools of enchantment spells grant you influence over a subject creature.

<a href="spelldefinitions53e5.html?ID=5"></a>Evocation

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Evocation spells manipulate magical energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired end. In effect, an evocation draws upon magic to create something out of nothing. Many of these spells produce spectacular effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of damage.

<a href="spelldefinitions3439.html?ID=6"></a>Illusion

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.

<a href="spelldefinitionsc655.html?ID=7"></a>Necromancy

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Necromancy spells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force. Spells involving undead creatures make up a large part of this school.

<a href="spelldefinitionsfc86.html?ID=8"></a>Transmutation

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
Transmutation spells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition.

<a href="spelldefinitions5a25.html?ID=9"></a>Universal

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type School
A small number of spells (arcane mark, limited wish, permanency, prestidigitation, and wish) are universal, belonging to no school.

<a href="spelldefinitionsf723.html?ID=10"></a>Calling

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A calling spell transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on. The spell grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin, although the spell may limit the circumstances under which this is possible. Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they do not disappear and reform, as do those brought by a summoning spell (see below). The duration of a calling spell is instantaneous, which means that the called creature can't be dispelled.

<a href="spelldefinitions87ac.html?ID=11"></a>Charm

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A charm spell changes how the subject views you, typically making it see you as a good friend.

<a href="spelldefinitionse996.html?ID=12"></a>Compulsion

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A compulsion spell forces the subject to act in some manner or changes the way its mind works. Some compulsion spells determine the subject's actions or the effects on the subject, others allow you to determine the subject's actions when you cast the spell, and still others give you ongoing control over the subject.

<a href="spelldefinitionsbd47.html?ID=13"></a>Creation

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A creation spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place the spellcaster designates. If the spell has a duration other than instantaneous, magic holds the creation together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace. If the spell has an instantaneous duration, the created object or creature is merely assembled through magic. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on magic for its existence.

<a href="spelldefinitionsb2d5.html?ID=14"></a>Figment

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A figment spell creates a false sensation. Those who perceive the figment perceive the same thing, not their own slightly different versions of the figment. It is not a personalized mental impression. Figments cannot make something seem to be something else. A figment that includes audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell description specifically says it can. If intelligible speech is possible, it must be in a language you can speak. If you try to duplicate a language you cannot speak, the figment produces gibberish. Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of something unless you know what it looks like (or copy another sense exactly unless you have experienced it).
Because figments and glamers are unreal, they cannot produce real effects the way that other types of illusions can. Figments and glamers cannot cause damage to objects or creatures, support weight, provide nutrition, or provide protection from the elements. Consequently, these spells are useful for confounding foes, but useless for attacking them directly.
A figment's AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.

<a href="spelldefinitionsd2c2.html?ID=15"></a>Glamer

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A glamer spell changes a subject's sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.

<a href="spelldefinitions6dda.html?ID=53"></a>Haunted

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nft?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Haunted-Heroes-Handbook">Haunted Heroes Handbook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
These spells manipulate the lingering spiritual energy suffusing an area or surrounding an object into semi-autonomous magical effects. Haunted spells function like regular spells, but those with ongoing durations can be neutralized as though they were haunts as they take effect. The statistics for each spell's haunt-like manifestation are listed at the end of the spell's other statistics.
Events during a haunted spell's duration may cause its haunt-like manifestation to reoccur during that round, causing a surprise round if combat has not yet begun. These manifestations grant victims and their allies additional chances to notice and neutralize the haunted spell before it takes effect. These additional manifestations do not allow new saving throws to negate the spell.
Since haunted spells derive their power from ambient emotional energy, a given area or object can host only one haunted spell at a time. Most haunted spells have shapeable areas of effect, which can be molded to fit the areas where they are cast, and their effects target all creatures in the area when the haunted spell manifests. Once a haunted spell is cast on an area or object, it remains in place for 1 week or until it is activated, triggering its haunt-like manifestation. Once an area or object hosts a haunted spell, it cannot host another haunted spell for at least 7 days after the first one activates. A single area or object cannot host a haunted spell and a regular haunt at the same time. As long as a haunted spell remains latent in an area, its caster can't prepare a new spell in that slot or regain that spell slot. When the haunted spell triggers, the caster can sense it but gains no insight or information about what triggered the haunt beyond what he can directly observe. A caster can dismiss a haunted spell as a swift action in order to prepare a new spell in that slot or to regain a spell slot; doing so causes the haunted spell to dissipate.
Haunted spells don't have histories like regular haunts do, so effects that reveal such information merely expose that the haunted spell is a magical effect. Efforts to communicate with haunted spells using <a href="equipmentmiscdisplayb7a8.html?ItemName=Talking%20board">talking boards</a>, the spells <a href="spelldisplay29c0.html?ItemName=call%20spirit">call spirit</a> and <a href="spelldisplaydc7a.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20haunt">speak with haunt</a>, or similar methods automatically fail.

<a href="spelldefinitions1707.html?ID=17"></a>Healing

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.

<a href="spelldefinitionse248.html?ID=18"></a>Pattern

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
Like a figment, a pattern spell creates an image that others can see, but a pattern also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it. All patterns are mind-affecting spells.

<a href="spelldefinitionsbf3c.html?ID=19"></a>Phantasm

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A phantasm spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subject (or subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is totally in the minds of the subjects. It is a personalized mental impression, all in their heads and not a fake picture or something that they actually see. Third parties viewing or studying the scene don't notice the phantasm. All phantasms are mind-affecting spells.

<a href="spelldefinitions18df.html?ID=20"></a>Polymorph

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A polymorph spell transforms your physical body to take on the shape of another creature. While these spells make you appear to be the creature, granting you a +10 bonus on Disguise skill checks, they do not grant you all of the abilities and powers of the creature. Each polymorph spell allows you to assume the form of a creature of a specific type, granting you a number of bonuses to your ability scores and a bonus to your natural armor. In addition, each polymorph spell can grant you a number of other benefits, including movement types, resistances, and senses. If the form you choose grants these benefits, or a greater ability of the same type, you gain the listed benefit. If the form grants a lesser ability of the same type, you gain the lesser ability instead. Your base speed changes to match that of the form you assume. If the form grants a swim or burrow speed, you maintain the ability to breathe if you are swimming or burrowing. The DC for any of these abilities equals your DC for the polymorph spell used to change you into that form.
In addition to these benefits, you gain any of the natural attacks of the base creature, including proficiency in those attacks. These attacks are based on your base attack bonus, modified by your Strength or Dexterity as appropriate, and use your Strength modifier for determining damage bonuses.
If a polymorph spell causes you to change size, apply the size modifiers appropriately, changing your armor class, attack bonus, Combat Maneuver Bonus, and Stealth skill modifiers. Your ability scores are not modified by this change unless noted by the spell.
Unless otherwise noted, polymorph spells cannot be used to change into specific individuals. Although many of the fine details can be controlled, your appearance is always that of a generic member of that creature's type. Polymorph spells cannot be used to assume the form of a creature with a template or an advanced version of a creature.
When you cast a polymorph spell that changes you into a creature of the animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin type, all of your gear melds into your body. Items that provide constant bonuses and do not need to be activated continue to function while melded in this way (with the exception of armor and shield bonuses, which cease to function). Items that require activation cannot be used while you maintain that form. While in such a form, you cannot cast any spells that require material components (unless you have the Eschew Materials or Natural Spell feat), and can only cast spells with somatic or verbal components if the form you choose has the capability to make such movements or speak, such as a dragon. Other polymorph spells might be subject to this restriction as well, if they change you into a form that is unlike your original form (subject to GM discretion). If your new form does not cause your equipment to meld into your form, the equipment resizes to match your new size.
While under the effects of a polymorph spell, you lose all extraordinary and supernatural abilities that depend on your original form (such as keen senses, scent, and darkvision), as well as any natural attacks and movement types possessed by your original form. You also lose any class features that depend upon form, but those that allow you to add features (such as sorcerers that can grow claws) still function. While most of these should be obvious, the GM is the final arbiter of what abilities depend on form and are lost when a new form is assumed. Your new form might restore a number of these abilities if they are possessed by the new form.
You can only be affected by one polymorph spell at a time. If a new polymorph spell is cast on you (or you activate a polymorph effect, such as wild shape), you can decide whether or not to allow it to affect you, taking the place of the old spell. In addition, other spells that change your size have no effect on you while you are under the effects of a polymorph spell.
If a polymorph spell is cast on a creature that is smaller than Small or larger than Medium, first adjust its ability scores to one of these two sizes using the following table before applying the bonuses granted by the polymorph spell.  <table class="inner"><tr><td>Creature's Original Size</td><td>Str</td><td>Dex</td><td>Con</td><td>Adjusted Size</td></tr><tr><td>Fine</td><td>+6</td><td>-6</td><td>-</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>Diminutive</td><td>+6</td><td>-4</td><td>-</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>+4</td><td>-2</td><td>-</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>-4</td><td>+2</td><td>-2</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>-8</td><td>+4</td><td>-4</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>-12</td><td>+4</td><td>-6</td><td>Medium</td></tr><tr><td>Colossal</td><td>-16</td><td>+4</td><td>-8</td><td>Medium</td></tr></table>

<a href="spelldefinitions1acc.html?ID=21"></a>Scrying

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A scrying spell creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of sensory acuity that you possess. This level of acuity includes any spells or effects that target you, but not spells or effects that emanate from you. The sensor, however, is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ of yours, and thus functions normally even if you have been blinded or deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment.
A creature can notice the sensor by making a Perception check with a DC 20 + the spell level. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an active spell.
Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks a scrying spell, and you sense that the spell is blocked.

<a href="spelldefinitionse205.html?ID=22"></a>Shadow

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A shadow spell creates something that is partially real from extradimensional energy. Such illusions can have real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion is real.

<a href="spelldefinitions2f56.html?ID=23"></a>Summoning

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A summoning spell instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate. When the spell ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back to where it came from, but a summoned object is not sent back unless the spell description specifically indicates this. A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0 or lower, but it is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to reform, during which time it can't be summoned again.
When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature disappears, all the spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have.

<a href="spelldefinitionsa856.html?ID=24"></a>Teleportation

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook</a>
Definition Type Subschool
A teleportation spell transports one or more creatures or objects a great distance. The most powerful of these spells can cross planar boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the transportation is (unless otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.
Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.

Definition Type Descriptor
Cold effects deal damage by making the target colder, typically by blasting it with supernaturally cooled matter or energy. Cold effects also include those that create ice, sleet, or snow out of nothing. They can cause frostbite, numbness, coordination problems, slowed movement and reactions, stupor, and death.

<a href="spelldefinitions87c0.html?ID=29"></a>Curse

Definition Type Descriptor
Spells that create darkness or reduce the amount of light should have the darkness descriptor. Giving a spell the darkness descriptor indicates whether a spell like <a href="spelldisplay0c31.html?ItemName=daylight">daylight</a> is high enough level to counter or dispel it.

<a href="spelldefinitionse0c3.html?ID=31"></a>Death

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Spells with the death descriptor directly attack a creature's life force to cause immediate death, or to draw on the power of a dead or dying creature. The <a href="spelldisplayeb38.html?ItemName=death%20ward">death ward</a> spell protects against death effects, and some creature types are immune to death effects.

<a href="spelldefinitionsf4e5.html?ID=32"></a>Disease

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Disease effects give the target a disease, which may be an invading organism such as a bacteria or virus, an abnormal internal condition (such as a cancer or mental disorder), or a recurring magical effect that acts like one of the former. Creatures with resistance or immunity to disease apply that resistance to their saving throw and the effects of disease spells.

<a href="spelldefinitions02b1.html?ID=33"></a>Draconic

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nfl?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Legacy-of-Dragons">Legacy of Dragons</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Spells with the draconic descriptor were created by dragons in ages long past, and still resonate within the blood of true dragons to this day. Creatures of the dragon type with 5 or more racial hit dice can select a draconic spell as a spell known regardless of the class spell list it's on. Each time such a creature gains an additional racial hit die, it can select a draconic spell in place of an existing spell known of the same or higher spell level.

<a href="spelldefinitions387c.html?ID=35"></a>Electricity

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Electricity effects involve the presence and f low of electrical charge, whether expressed in amperes or volts. Electricity deals damage to creatures by disrupting their biological systems. It deals damage to objects (as well as creatures) by heating the material it passes through, and thus technically many electricity spells could also be treated as fire spells, but for sake of game simplicity, it is better to just let electricity-based spells deal electricity damage. Electricity effects may stun, paralyze, or even kill.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Fire effects make the target hotter by creating fire, directly heating the target with magic or friction. Lava, steam, and boiling water all deal fire damage. Fire effects can also cause confusion, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, unconsciousness, and death. Spells that manipulate fire or conjure creatures from fire-dominant planes or with the fire subtype should have the fire descriptor.

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Spells that create significant amounts of light or attack darkness effects should have the light descriptor. Giving a spell the light descriptor indicates whether a spell like <a href="spelldisplay47a2.html?ItemName=darkness">darkness</a> is high enough level counter or dispel it.

<a href="spelldefinitions9b9b.html?ID=45"></a>Meditative

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9nvh?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Divine-Anthology">Divine Anthology</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Meditative spells are not cast like other spells-they are cast during the period of the day when a spellcaster prepares her spells. A meditative spell must already be prepared at the time when you start your 1-hour spell preparation ritual, and at the end of that time, the meditative spell of your choosing is cast, leaving you with that one spell slot used for the remainder of the day. You can have only one meditative spell in effect on you at any one time. All meditative spells have a range of personal and a target of you, and they can't be brewed into potions or part of similar one-use items like elixirs. A meditative spell can be placed on a scroll or in a wand, but the act of casting the spell must always be incorporated into the user's spell-preparation time; it also takes 1 hour for a character who succeeds at an appropriate Use Magic Device check to operate such an item. Though some of these spells are on the cleric spell list, they can't be part of an oracle's list of spells known. Spontaneous casters such as oracles or sorcerers cannot benefit from the effects of a meditative spell, nor can characters who use such magic without preparation via Use Magic Device and a magic item, since part of the process of casting and maintaining the effects of a meditative spell involves tying the act of weaving the magic into the very process of meditation and study that a prepared spellcaster (such as a cleric or wizard) undergoes at the start of every day.

<a href="spelldefinitions2a7e.html?ID=46"></a>Mind-Affecting

Definition Type Descriptor
Pain effects cause unpleasant sensations without any permanent physical damage (though a sensitive target may suffer mental repercussions from lengthy exposure to pain). Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fort save (such as constructs and undead) are immune to pain effects.

<a href="spelldefinitionsf826.html?ID=48"></a>Poison

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic</a>
Definition Type Descriptor
Poison effects use poison, venom, drugs, or similar toxic substances to disrupt and damage living creatures through chemical reactions. Technically, acids and poisons are both chemical reactions, but for the purpose of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, they are categorized as different effects, with acids dealing hit point damage and poisons causing ability damage, ability drain, bleeding, confusion, convulsions, nausea, paralysis, reduced healing, suffocation, unconsciousness, or death. Creatures with resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells. Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell (for example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison could still trap or drown a poison-immune creature).

Definition Type Descriptor
Spells with the ruse descriptor are easily mistaken for other spells and are intended to confuse even onlookers trained in Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana). Attempts to identify a ruse spell by its effects, its aura, its components, or other attributes with a skill check treat the spell as though it were a different spell, as indicated in the spell's description. The one attempting the check can correctly identify the spell only by exceeding the DC by 10. The false spell is typically a level lower than the ruse spell, so skill checks use the DC for the lower-level spell. Even <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> and most similar spells don't prevent the caster from being fooled by a ruse spell. <a href="spelldisplay60a5.html?ItemName=Analyze%20dweomer">Analyze dweomer</a>, <a href="spelldisplayc78f.html?ItemName=arcane%20sight,%20greater">greater arcane sight</a>, and similar spells of the same or higher spell level that automatically identify spells reveal a ruse spell for what it is. Ruse spells that mimic harmless spells still list harmless on their saving throw or spell resistance lines; a creature that knows or suspects the true nature of the spell typically chooses to attempt the save.

Definition Type Descriptor
Sonic effects transmit energy to the target through frequent oscillations of pressure through the air, water, or ground. Sounds that are too high or too low for the humanoid ear to detect can still transmit enough energy to cause harm, which means that these effects can even affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, and temporary blindness, and can detect creatures using batlike echolocation.
