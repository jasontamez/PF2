Your painful stare fatigues your opponent.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.

Benefit:  When a target takes damage from your painful stare, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round. This can't cause the target to become exhausted, even if the target is already fatigued.
