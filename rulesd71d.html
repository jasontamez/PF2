The GM's primary job is to run the game, but there's more to that task than just rolling dice and orchestrating ingame challenges. As the group member most responsible for the game's success, the GM is also the de facto host for each session, in charge of handling or delegating the logistics behind the fun.

The social side of a session is at least as important as the quality of the game itself. Adult gamers might rarely get time to socialize, given the pressures of jobs, families, and homes, so game night becomes a welcome chance to spend time with friends, no different than a night of board games, movies, or poker. And like any party, there's work to be done both before and after.

Some of the following issues can be delegated to a willing player, but ultimately, all of them are the GM's responsibility.

Before a game ever begins it's up to the GM to decide how many players to invite to play. While there is no f irm minimum or maximum limit to how many players a game can accommodate, this choice is largely a matter of how many players the GM expects he can comfortably manage and what limitations a game's expected play space present. Although most published adventures present challenges for parties with four characters, any encounter can easily be customized to suit the needs of any size group.

Once you know how many players you-d like to have, it's time to organize a group. Start by talking to friends and family members you-d like to include. Mixing ages is fine so long as there are enough common interests.

If there's still room at your game table, you can consider people you don't yet know or know only tangentially. Coworkers and friends of friends are usually the first to be included in this set, especially if your players have sung the praises of your game to other people.

Outside of such personal contacts, there are a number of other ways to find players. Try contacting a local game store about putting up a flier with your contact information, or see if there's a gaming club at your school or the local college. The Internet offers instant access to thousands of gamers via free classified ads or message boards, and there are several websites specifically devoted to helping local gamers connect, such as the <a href="http://paizo.com/community/forums/gamerLife/gaming/connection">Gamer Connection forum on paizo.com</a>. (Of course, safety always comes first-you should meet strangers in public places with plenty of people around and should never give out more personal information than an email address until you trust someone.)

Last but not least, when in doubt, go where the gamers are. Attend a local game convention, science fiction movie opening, or other event that might be of interest to gamers. Talk to people there, and if you find a gamer who lives nearby, mention that you're looking for players and provide contact information.

If you don't want to do the recruiting yourself, you can allow one or more players to handle it, but it's a good idea to ask that they run any potential new players past you-or even the whole group-for approval before inviting them to a session.

A word of warning: As with any party, it's important to make sure that everyone you invite to your game gets along with the rest. While you can't predict every conflict, you can do your best to avoid obvious problems-this might be a player whose style doesn't match the rest of the group (see Problem Players in Chapter Three), or a player with a more obvious conflict, such as a current player's ex-spouse. A lot of gaming groups fall apart because of interplayer conflict. As a result, when taking a chance on a new player, it's generally best to issue a limited invitation, such as for a single adventure, and then decide from there. Don't let a party member who's friends with a potential player-or worse, the potential player himself-pressure you into inviting him back if he isn't right for your game.

Sometimes games aren't hard to schedule. If you and your players all live near each other in college dorms, you might have no trouble getting a game together every night. But if you or your players have other responsibilities, scheduling can become a major headache.

One of the easiest ways is to have a regular schedule. Some campaigns are played weekly, others biweekly, and still others monthly. More frequent games are rare and usually unsustainable, as are games with more than a month between them, since players tend to forget what's going on after a while. A weekly game is optimal for many people since it's easy to remember. Weekends tend to be better for working people, but constant weekend availability is probably impossible for any one person. Weekdays after school may work for parents and students, but choosing a day can be tricky, since sports and club meetings may interfere for long periods.

If you do decide to go for biweekly or monthly games, you may want to make the sessions longer. Try scheduling an entire day for a monthly game-or even a weekend, if your household is up to overnight guests. For a game with low meeting frequency, be sure to remind everyone when the next session is coming up. You'll also need to prepare a good recap of what happened in the previous adventure so the players know where the characters were when you left off.

If you opt for an irregular schedule, you'll need to schedule every session, which can be more difficult, as players don't have the option of always leaving certain days open. Scheduling an irregular game can happen at the end of each session or via group emails and phone calls.
