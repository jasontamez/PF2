Description

This set consists of two masks of hammered iron, one sized for a gorthek's face and the other sized for the face of its orc handler. To bond a gorthek with its handler, orcs permanently nail the gorthek masks to the respective wearers' faces. The magic functions only when the gorthek masks are affixed to one orc and one gorthek. It doesn't work with animals other than gortheks. There's only a 60% chance an orc's mask will function when affixed to a non-orc humanoid-and it's impossible to tell whether a mask will work until after it has been permanently attached.

The orc's mask is fashioned with horns on the side, resembling those of a gorthek. With its bonded gorthek, the wearer gains the benefits of speak with animals and a +10 competence bonus on Handle Animal checks.

The gorthek's mask depicts fearsome tusks, scales, or other features meant to make the creature look more terrifying. A gorthek wearing its mask ignores the first 5 points of hardness of any object it hits with a gore attack when performing a sunder combat maneuver or when smashing an object. Any creature other than its handler takes a -10 penalty on Handle Animal checks against a bonded gorthek.
