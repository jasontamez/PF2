Your reverence for an empyreal lord is so great that daily
prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons.


Prerequisites: Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, must worship
an empyreal lord.

Benefit:  Each empyreal lord requires a different
obedience, but all obediences take only 1 hour to perform.
Once you've performed the obedience, you gain the
benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the
"Obedience" entry for the empyreal lord.

If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first
boon granted by your empyreal lord upon undertaking
your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also
gain the empyreal lord's second boon. If you have 20 Hit
Dice or more, you also gain the empyreal lord's third boon.
Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is
listed, a boon's effects are constant.

Mystery cultists (see page 48) gain access to these boons
at lower levels as a benefit of their prestige class.

If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose all
access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until
you next perform the obedience.
