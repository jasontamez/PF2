Description

You receive a clear and memorable view of the layout of chambers,
barriers, and connecting passages within the area of effect. This
spell does not reveal the contents or inhabitants of any of these
locations, only the basic architecture of the space. For example, a
staircase leading up to a pair of doors would be apparent, but the
iron golems guarding the doors would not. This spell does identify
the locations of secret doors and hidden passages but gives no clue
as to the means of opening or accessing them.
