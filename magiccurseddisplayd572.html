Description

This bow appears to be a +2 distance
shortbow, but its curse is that it suffers
a -4 cumulative penalty for each range
increment beyond the first. Furthermore,
it takes an additional -4 penalty on
critical confirmation rolls when firing
beyond the first range increment. This
bow must be used as its wielder's primary ranged weapon and
can only be discarded after the owner is subject to a remove
curse spell or similar effect.
