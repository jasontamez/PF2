Description

Roughly carved from porous stone that litters the base of the Tusk Mountains, these pots allow Kellid nomads to carry burning coals from one day's campsite to the next, so they can quickly start cook fires wherever they find themselves. Coals placed within an ember pot stay hot for 24 hours, and allow anyone to light a fire in normal conditions without needing to make a Survival check.
