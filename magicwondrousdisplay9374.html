Description

This garish cloak of red velvet is embroidered with gold-threaded
patterns, typically in shapes of sinisterly masked
harlequins or other imagery of sinister revelry. The cloak
acts like a cloak of the mountebank, but its dimension door
power can be used three times per day. Furthermore, once
per day the wearer of the cloak can use ethereal jaunt, as
per the spell.
