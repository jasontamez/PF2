As its name implies, dark fantasy isn't a subgenre of horror but rather a fantasy subgenre that relies on horror themes. Dark fantasies typically involve the same tropes as fantasy tales'swords, castles, magic, heroics-but viewed through a grim lens. Deadliness, despair, and the macabre are common here, elements that threaten innocents with forces beyond their power to understand or overcome.

Storytelling: In these tales, magic and the supernatural take on a darker and deadlier cast. Enchanted lands become accursed places filled with ravenous predators and dangerous outcasts. Magic might bear the threat of arcane backlash or addiction. Monsters are fearful things, whether they are born from the corpses of former neighbors, demonic incarnations of temptations, or terrifying beasts that city walls dubiously hold at bay. It's a pessimistic sort of fantasy where threats are many and death seems likely, yet the heroes of these stories have the opportunity to defend the rare places of warmth and light. Not unlike other fantasy heroes, they become champions of the helpless and foes of evil. However, here the odds are stacked far more heavily against them.

Monsters and Threats: Aberrations, constructs, evil outsiders, and undead are common in dark fantasy adventures, as are grim reimaginings of magical beasts and other classic fantasy creatures. Evil spells, cursed magic items, and magical environmental hazards are also typical. With a properly grim twist, nearly any fantasy element could find its home in a dark fantasy adventure.

Basic Plots: Necromancers use the corpses of a plague-scoured village to create a <a href="monsterdisplay3300.html?ItemName=Gashadokuro">gashadokuro</a>. A <a href="monsterdisplay8e0b-2.html?ItemName=Gargoyle">gargoyle</a> trophy hunter is responsible for a series of baffling murders. A <a href="monsterdisplay358f.html?ItemName=Troll">troll</a> uses the sewer to slip into the basement of the royal archives and preys upon scholars who linger too long after dark.

Advanced Plots: A genius arcanist seeks to recreate the empire of a fallen undead tyrant by retracing his path to <a href="monsterdisplay37f3.html?ItemName=Lich">lichdom</a>. A rift between realities allows the hordes of the Abyss to invade the world. The corpse of everyone who dies returns as a <a href="monsterdisplay30e4.html?ItemName=Ghoul">ghoul</a> within 1 day, forcing the PCs to investigate why souls are not passing on to the afterlife.
