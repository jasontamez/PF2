Description

This small silver shackle is carved with conjuration runes. When
used as a focus as part of a summoning spell of 3rd level or less,
it creates a faintly-glowing intangible magical chain from the
caster to the summoned creature or creatures. The duration of
that summoning spell is extended as if using the Extend Spell
feat, with no increase in casting time. The chain prevents the
creature from moving more than 30 feet from the caster, even
when using teleportation (though the caster can use these
effects to exceed this distance, which ends the shackling effect
immediately). The chain does not otherwise obstruct or interfere
with any object or creature other than the summoned creature.
The shackle may be used up to five times per day. If the shackle
or the chain is dispelled, the range limitation and increased
duration ends; if the spell's unmodified duration would already
have ended by then, the spell ends immediately.
