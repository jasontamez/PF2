When fighting with two weapons, use the lower attack bonus of the two weapons. If you score one hit, you also score a hit with your off-hand weapon. If you have <a href="featdisplayebc1.html?ItemName=Improved%20Two-%20Weapon%20Fighting">Improved Two- Weapon Fighting</a> and score two hits, you also score a second hit with your off-hand weapon, for a total of four. If you have <a href="featdisplayd76e.html?ItemName=Greater%20Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a> and score three hits, you also score a third hit with your off-hand weapon, for a total of six.

Critical Hits with Two-Weapon Fighting: If you threaten a critical hit when using Two-Weapon Fighting, roll a single confirmation roll using the lower attack bonus among the two weapons. If you confirm, you score one critical hit with each weapon, so long as the initial roll threatened a critical with both weapons. For example, if you're fighting with a rapier and a light pick, roll an 18 on your initial attack roll, and confirm the critical hit, you score a critical hit with only the rapier. However, if you roll a 20 and confirm, you score a critical hit with each weapon.
