Description

While normally functioning as a standard well of many worlds, this well possesses a command word that supersedes its normal placement-based destination, and it instead opens up onto a single location designated by its maker during the well's creation (often the creator's home or a private, warded demiplane). Those finding the well are not immediately aware of this command word unless a spell more powerful than a simple identify spell is used, and the well's secret destination, whatever it might be, may or may not still be occupied.
