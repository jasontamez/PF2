Charge Through - Feats







Charge Through (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 156</a>
You can overrun enemies when charging.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay6051.html?ItemName=Improved%20Overrun">Improved Overrun</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  When making a charge, you can attempt to overrun one creature in the path of the charge as a free action. If you successfully overrun that creature, you can complete the charge. If the overrun is unsuccessful, the charge ends in the space directly in front of that creature.

Normal:  You must have a clear path toward the target of your charge.

When you attempt and fail to overrun a creature in the path of your charge, you can spend 5 stamina points to finish your charge against that creature instead of losing your charge.

Mythic Charge Through

You can plow through those who stand between you and the target of your charge.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaye51b.html?ItemName=Charge%20Through">Charge Through.</a>

Benefit:  When charging, you can ignore allies in your path when determining whether or not you can charge your target. Furthermore, after you have attempted at least one overrun with Charge Through, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to attempt another overrun against a different opponent in the path of the same charge.
