You have a near-perfect sense of direction.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus (Survival)</a>, Survival 5 ranks.

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost and to determine whether you are lost. You also gain a +4 bonus on Intelligence checks to navigate mazes, including to escape a maze spell. Once per day, you can use your intuition to determine whether traveling a particular direction from a fork in the road (or other junction) might be productive or dangerous. This functions like the augury spell, except it provides weal or woe based on traveling in a particular direction.
