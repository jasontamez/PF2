Description

Particularly useful for travelers moving through areas too small or remote to support a full-time place for gambling, this small, tightly packed suitcase holds decks of cards, a betting wheel, numbered cloths, colored wooden chips, and a wide variety of other sorts of specialized equipment necessary for many different games of chance. A cheating gambler's kit is very similar, except its cards are marked and its games are rigged, giving a knowledgeable user a +4 circumstance bonus on Profession (gambler) checks when using these materials. A DC 25 Perception or DC 20 Profession (gambler) check exposes the ruse.
