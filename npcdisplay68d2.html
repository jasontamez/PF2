Tactics

Before Combat The druid casts liveoak every 13 days, and endure elements each morning.
During Combat The druid casts stoneskin on her treant and orders it into combat. She wild shapes into a bat and casts cat's grace and barkskin on herself. She then casts cure spells or spontaneous summon nature's ally as necessary. If entering melee, she casts protection from energy and greater magic fang, then wild shapes into a treant herself.

These druids see themselves not as protectors of the forest, but as part of it, like the fey they associate with.

Pai Spiritwind

An inhabitant of a fey-infested forest, Pai fiercely advocates for the fey and their causes. After many run-ins with destructive humans, she considers all non-fey creatures (excluding gnomes) to be trespassers and attacks them on sight.
