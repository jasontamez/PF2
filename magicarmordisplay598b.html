Description

Shadow blending armor is drab and mutes any colors in its wearer's attire into dull grays. Attacks against the wearer in dim light have a 40% miss chance instead of the normal 20%. This ability does not grant total concealment; it only increases the miss chance. If the armor also has the shadow, improved shadow, or greater shadow armor special ability, the miss chance increases to 50%.
