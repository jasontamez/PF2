Description

A fervent weapon thrums with the divine power of a specific
deity or set of deities. If the wielder is an adherent of the deity
or deities, she gains several benefits. First, the wielder gains a
+4 insight bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks
to conceal the weapon from members of other religions. On a
successful hit against a flat-footed target of a different religion,
the target must succeed at DC 13 Will save or be shaken for 1
minute. Finally, the wielder receives a +2 bonus to confirm critical
hits against members of other religions.

The creator of a fervent weapon must be within one step
of the religion to be attuned to the weapon, along either the
lawful/chaotic axis or the good/evil axis. The target religion must
be determined at the weapon's creation and cannot be altered.
