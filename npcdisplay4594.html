Some doomsayers walk in solitude; others form cults to witness the end.

Asha Garcer

After preaching the end times since her youth, Asha now seeks to hasten the apocalypse. Her cult, hundreds strong, sings the dirges of a dying world. Some say she exploits people's fears of the apocalypse, but others think Asha truly believes her rants. All of her cultists show total dedication. Though they would rather live to see the end of the world, they fight fearlessly to the death for Asha's cause.

Combat Encounters: A host of zealots defends Asha.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Any meeting to gain the grim cult leader's blessing requires an invitation.
