Select one spell. You cast that spell with greater than normal power.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus.</a>

Benefit:  Select one spell of a school for which you have taken the Spell Focus feat. Treat your caster level as being two higher for all level-variable effects of the spell.

Every time you gain an even level in the spellcasting class you chose your spell from, you can choose a new spell to replace the spell selected with this feat, and that spell becomes your specialized spell.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different spell.
