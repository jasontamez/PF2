Description

This cluster of emeralds attached to a delicate golden clasp is arranged in the likeness of a fivepetaled blossom. Regardless of how it is worn, it does not take up an item slot. As long as the pendant is visible on the wearer's person, it grants a +4 competence bonus on Disguise and Stealth checks to the wearer. In addition, once per day when the command word is spoken, the emeralds take on the appearance of a living flower, gaining the ability to magically imbue 2d4 freshly picked berries so that each can provide a meal and cure 1 point of damage when eaten, as per goodberry.
