Lust

A phantom with this focus aches for the intoxicating pleasures it experienced during life. These phantoms often writhe sensuously and whisper promises of unadulterated bliss to those they fight. Lust phantoms are typically deep rose in color, and they sometimes emit musky, exotic scents when they move.

Skills: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Bluff and Diplomacy equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

Good Saves: Fortitude and Will.

Constitution Focus: A phantom with this focus gains a +2 bonus to Constitution and a -2 penalty to Dexterity. Instead of gaining a bonus to Dexterity as the spiritualist gains levels, a lust-focused phantom gains a bonus to Constitution instead.

Alluring Presence (Su): A phantom with this focus can coerce enemies to attack it. As an immediate action, the phantom attempts a Diplomacy check against a creature targeting the spiritualist with an attack or harmful spell, provided the phantom is within the target creature's reach (or range, if the creature is attacking with a ranged weapon or spell). The DC for this check equals 10 + 1/2 the attacking creature's HD + the attacking creature's Wisdom modifier. If successful, the phantom becomes the target of all the creature's attacks for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion emotion effect.

Mine Alone (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, whenever the spiritualist or the phantom is subject to a charm or compulsion effect, the target of the effect can roll twice for its save-once using the spiritualist's Will save modifier and once using the phantom's-and take the better result.

Aura of Ecstasy (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the lust phantom emanates an aura of ecstasy. All creatures adjacent to the phantom must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier) or be shaken and staggered each round that they remain within the aura of ecstasy. Creatures that succeed at this save are immune to this phantom's aura of ecstasy for 24 hours.

Sinful Command (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, once per day as a standard action, the phantom can attempt to assume control of another creature's mind as per the dominate monster spell. The DC of the effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the phantom's Hit Dice + the phantom's Charisma modifier.
