Description

While this spell is active, you may reroll one attack roll, combat maneuver check, or skill check before the result of the roll or check is known. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. Once the reroll is used, the spell ends. You can have no more than one fallback strategy active on you at the same time.
