Your attention to detail provides you with insights into
how to more effectively and economically gain certain
commodities.


Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay9e7a.html?ItemName=Focused%20Worker">Focused Worker.</a>

Benefit:  You can spend a day of downtime to purchase
one type of capital for half its normal cost (see Purchasing
Capital on page 77 of Ultimate Campaign). This capital must
be the same as the focus capital you chose for the Focused
Worker feat. However, the cost of the neglected capital,
chosen as part of the same Focused Worker feat, increases
by half again its normal amount. These changes in price
apply to both the purchased cost and the earned cost of
the affected forms of capital.


Special:  You may take this feat twice, but only if you
have also chosen the Focused Worker feat twice. This feat
only affects one feat's focus capital. The second time you
take this feat, choose the other focus capital from your
Focused Worker feats.
