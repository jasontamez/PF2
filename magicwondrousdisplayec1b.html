Description

Rootlike filaments of cold iron wind their way around this adamantine spike, tapering as they approach its point. When driven deeply into solid stone or a stone object weighing at least 1,000 pounds, the spike emits an aura that interferes with spellcasting to a radius of 60 feet. Any spells cast within the radius have a 30% chance of failing. This chance of spell failure does not stack with spell failure from other sources. The aura persists until the spike is removed. Driving the spike into the ground or pulling it free with a successful DC 15 Strength check is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. If wielded in combat, a null spike functions as a +1 adamantine dagger.
