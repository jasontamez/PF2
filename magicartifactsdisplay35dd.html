Description

<a href="monsterdisplay54b2.html?ItemName=Szuriel">Szuriel's</a> weapon is Lamentation of the Faithless, a black-bladed +5 <a href="magicweaponsdisplay6bb5.html?ItemName=Speed">speed</a> <a href="magicweaponsdisplay02ed.html?ItemName=unholy">unholy</a> greatsword. When using the blade to attack, Szuriel regains 1d6 hit points with each successful hit. If Szuriel presents her sword as a standard action, all creatures within 60 feet that view it are blinded and affected by crushing despair for 1d4+1 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 30 Will save. Creatures with the good subtype and divine spellcasters take a -4 penalty on this save. As a standard action, Szuriel can call the sword to her hand from any distance, including across planar boundaries.

Destruction

The sword shatters and sublimates if it is ever placed in the empty, walled garden at the summit of Heaven's mountain by a risen, repentant fiend.
