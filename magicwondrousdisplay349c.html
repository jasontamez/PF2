Description

Laurel leaves crafted from fine gold decorate this circlet that
imparts powers of persuasion and leadership. The wearer's
voice carries great authority and can inspire others to victory. As
a swift action, the wearer can speak words of encouragement
or advice to an ally within 30 feet. That ally gains a +2 morale
bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability
checks until the start of the wearer's next turn. The wearer can
use the laurel to grant this bonus to himself. A creature cannot
gain this bonus more than once per day.
