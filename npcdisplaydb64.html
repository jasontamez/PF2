Wu Shen

Wu Shen loves death as if it were an actual person. She speaks of death as "her lover" and never as "death" or any proper name, and listeners may mistakenly believe she is referring to a mortal person. She relishes every killing, seeing them as love notes of a sort. Death's affection is the most elusive prize, and each murder brings her a moment of hope that it will acknowledge her as its favorite. To challenge herself and prove her worthiness, she often sets specific criteria for her kills, such as death in exactly three hits, or from two different directions, or while holding a black rose in her off hand.

Combat Encounters: Wu Shen might select a PC to be the target of her latest challenge, attacking unexpectedly and retreating without saying a word if she fails to meet the self-imposed parameters of her challenge.

Roleplaying Suggestions: With her highly romanticized way of speaking about "her lover," Wu Shen might convince the PCs to help her with specific killings under the pretense of deeds of heroic chivalry. The PCs may persuade her to help them with battles that would pose a unique enough challenge to attract her lover's attention.
