Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 125</a>
Your spells break through spell resistance much more easily than most.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayd0d6.html?ItemName=Spell%20Penetration">Spell Penetration.</a>

Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on caster level checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature's spell resistance. This bonus stacks with the one from Spell Penetration.
