The tribal seer speaks to hostile spirits and interprets omens that affect her tribe.

Greshek the Sighted

Greshek was trained by her father, the tribe's previous seer, and inherited his role when he died in a battle with an angry ghost. She tries to avoid violence and conflict, and would rather pacify an enemy to learn what it knows than kill it outright.

Combat Encounters: Greshek counsels her tribe to capture the PCs because of information she learned from an omen or by spying on them.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Greshek might have seen an omen or heard from a spirit that foretold that the PCs are vital to her or her tribe's survival.
