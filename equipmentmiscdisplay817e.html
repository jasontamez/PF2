Preparation After soaking in salt water for 1 hour, a cloud puff must be dried in a delicate process that requires it to be turned three times per hour for 4 hours. This requires a successful DC 12 Craft (alchemy) check.
Use By crushing a dried cloud puff and inhaling the spores, a creature becomes light-headed and its mind grows resistant to outside influences. For the next hour, the creature gains a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects but takes a -2 penalty on Wisdom-based skill checks.

Description

The spores of this odorous pale-gray fungus cause a euphoric light-headedness.
