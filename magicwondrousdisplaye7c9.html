Description

These thick leather cords wrap around the wearer's biceps and
shoulders. When worn, they make the wearer's muscles appear
larger than normal. The wearer treats his Strength score as 8
higher than normal when determining his carrying capacity.
This bonus does not apply to combat, breaking items, or any
other Strength-related rolls, it only contributes to the amount of
equipment or material the wearer can carry.
