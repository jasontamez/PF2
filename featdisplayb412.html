Thrown weapons fly from your hands as if blown by a gale, and you leave behind a wake of wind as you move.

Prerequisites: Dex 13; Wis 13; <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>; <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility</a>; <a href="featdisplayda34.html?ItemName=Perfect%20Style">Perfect Style</a>; <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw</a>; <a href="featdisplay5087.html?ItemName=Unfolding%20Wind%20Strike">Unfolding Wind Strike</a>; base attack bonus +13 or monk level 13th.

Benefit: When using Perfect Style and wielding thrown weapons, you can combine a full-attack action with a single move action. You must forgo the attack at your highest bonus but can take the remaining attacks as normal at any point during your movement. You can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to create a path of wind along your path of movement that functions as wind wall for 1 round; this effect does not affect your ranged attacks.
