Rather than being overwhelmed by mind-blasting distortions of reality, you gained a perverse clarity of insight and strength of will bordering on insane certainty.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, Worldwound affinity.

Benefit: Anyone attempting to read your thoughts, communicate with you via telepathy, or otherwise contact your mind is dazed for 1d4 rounds (Will save DC 15 + your Cha modifier negates). In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on Will saves.

Special: You take a -1 penalty on all Intelligence-based skill checks.

You may only gain this feat at 1st level.
