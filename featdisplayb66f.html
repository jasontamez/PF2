Your symbiotic vines have spread all throughout your body, granting you a lesser form of the immunities enjoyed by plant creatures.

Prerequisites: Con 13, gathlain.

Benefit:  When you are paralyzed, magically put to sleep, or stunned, you ignore the effects of that condition, but you are instead staggered for the same duration as the ignored condition. Removing the ignored condition also removes this staggered condition, but you can't otherwise remove the staggered condition, nor can immunity to being staggered protect against it.
