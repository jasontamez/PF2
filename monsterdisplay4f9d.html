Taxidermic Grizzly Bear

Tufts of haphazard fur line the body of this gruesome bear, while
great lines of stitching crisscross its body.

Description

Taxidermic creatures are the work of obsessed individuals
seeking to use their alchemical or occult talents to preserve
and reanimate lifeless beings. The abilities of taxidermic
creatures often pale in comparison to those of their living
counterparts, as they are bereft of intelligence or an animate
life force to guide them. Instead, taxidermic creatures
possess a rudimentary form of instinct, though they are
still able to follow basic instructions from their creators.

Less refined than the magic used to animate undead,
golems, and other constructs, the creation of a taxidermic
creature is at best an inaccurate science. There is no one
method of crafting a taxidermic creature, so each result
is different. Every creature crafted in such a manner is
prone to inherent defects based on the materials used or
shortcuts taken during the process, and may or may not
be able to obey its creators commands in a satisfactory
manner. Because of taxidermic creatures' limited mental
faculties, their creators must be extremely careful and
literal when commanding them.

Left unattended, taxidermic creatures stand in place,
having no need to drink, eat, or sleep. Unless given
specific commands, the actions of these creatures
are unpredictable. Each taxidermic creature behaves
differently, depending on the quirks of its individual
construction. Some taxidermic creatures move and act
like prowling animals, while others move with the rigidity
and unerring purpose of animated objects. Some twisted
taxidermists have gone so far as to create taxidermic
humanoids, aberrations, and even fey.
