Description

You gain mastery over the element matching the elemental essence in your blood (fire for ifrits, earth for oreads, air for sylphs, and water for undines). If you are a suli, you can choose any one of the four options as you cast this spell, but the duration is reduced to 1 round per level. Your mastery gives you an insight bonus to your speed or a new movement mode, depending on the element you master, and grants one additional benefit. This spell's descriptor matches the chosen element.
