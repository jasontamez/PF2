You've learned to defend yourself against spell and storm with dazzling flourishes of your weapon.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb423.html?ItemName=Alertness">Alertness</a>, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (Aldori dueling sword)</a>, base attack bonus +4.

Benefit: Whenever you use Combat Expertise, fight defensively, or take the total defense action, choose a type of saving throw. (You can choose a different type each time you take such an action.) Once per round before attempting a saving throw using the selected save, you gain a +2 bonus on that save. If you have a base attack bonus of +11 or higher, this bonus increases to +3. If you have a base attack bonus of +16 or higher, the bonus instead increases to +4.
