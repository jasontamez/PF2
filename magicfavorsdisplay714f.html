Description

This delicate example of papercraft is often given to a paramour, with the promise that the love of the presenter will protect the recipient. A paper flower is worn behind the ear. For 24 hours, the first creature to directly attack the wearer (even with a targeted spell) must succeed at a DC 12 Will saving throw or be unable to follow through with the attack (as per sanctuary).
