Description

Once possessed by a brijidine azata
dedicated to ending the depredations
of kytons, this potent magic weapon
now holds a portion of her essence.
This +1 shock whip is woven from
green leather and crackles with
electricity, seemingly writhing of its
own volition. Three times per day, when the wielder uses
Rythius to successfully trip a creature, the target of the trip
attack is subject to a dimensional anchor effect. The wielder
can choose to suppress this ability as a swift action.

Furthermore, in the hands of a wielder with a good
alignment, the weapon becomes a +1 kyton bane shock
whip. Rythius is infused with good, and as a result it bestows
1 negative level on any nongood creature wielding it. This
negative level persists as long as the weapon is wielded
and disappears when the item is put away. The negative
level cannot be overcome in any way (including by means of
restoration spells) while it is wielded.
