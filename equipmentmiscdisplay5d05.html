Description

This tough wickerwork cylinder is typically 3 feet tall and 2 feet wide. It has no top or bottom, and can be filled with about 10 cubic feet of earth, stone, or other heavy materials while standing upright to provide substantial cover. Filling a gabion with earth using a shovel generally requires 4 minutes of work for a Medium character or 8 minutes of work for a Small character. One gabion provides cover for a Small character and might provide partial cover for a Medium character, at the GM's discretion. Two gabions together can provide cover to a Medium character, although if they aren't stacked atop each other, they can form only a low obstacle depending on the character's height.

Gabions can be made of different materials, but the type described here is one of the most common varieties.
