Description

This shadowcraft weapon glows with palpable malice, its hunger ceaselessly gnawing upon the wits of its wielder. Whenever the wielder of an enervative shadowcraft weapon confirms a critical hit with the weapon against an opponent that failed its Will saving throw to disbelieve, the opponent gains 1 negative level. One day after being struck, a target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 15 + the weapon's enhancement bonus, if any) for each negative level gained or any such levels become permanent.
