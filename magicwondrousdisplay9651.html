Description

This crystal lens fits over a single eye but
takes up the entire eyes slot. Once per day,
the wearer is able to gaze at a 10-foot-by-10-
foot area and see exactly what occurred in
that area during the past 24 hours. The vision
of what occurred in the specified area comes
to the user in a single minute of observation; if that minute
is interrupted, the wearer must use the monocle again to get
the full observation. All the visual details of the observed
events are clear and memorable to the user, no matter how
obscure. The monocle does not, however, provide any insight
into the observed events besides what can be visually seen.
Observed conversations cannot be heard, for example.
