Boon A holy warrior can accompany the PCs for up to 3 days on a mission consistent with his alignment or can send a squad of up to four temple guards (as guards) for 1 day.

Holy warriors are divinely sanctified and anointed warriors, raining death with bow and blade upon the forces of darkness and bringing hope and rescue to the desperate. Holy warriors are versatile combatants and could be masters of a temple or monastery. A holy warrior might command ten temple guards (as guards, CR 9), while a pair of holy warriors might escort a priest (CR 10). A half dozen could be a saint's honor guard (CR 13).
