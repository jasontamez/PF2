Bull-Catcher Toss (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s7z">Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 8</a>
You can use a charging foe's momentum to throw them aside.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplaye9a7.html?ItemName=Bull-Catcher%20Style">Bull-Catcher Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, Improved Unarmed Strike; base attack bonus +8, brawler level 4th, or monk level 4th.

Benefit: When you successfully grapple a creature with the Bull-Catcher Style feat, you can immediately move that creature into any square you threaten. After it is placed, you can break your grapple as an immediate action to move the creature an additional 5 feet in any direction. You can't use this maneuver to move a foe into a space that is intrinsically dangerous or unstable, such as a pit, wall of fire, or midair.
