You have an extra wellspring of kundalini energy that you can use to open your chakras.

Prerequisites: Ability to awaken the root chakra.

Benefit:  You gain a pool that holds 3 points of serpentfire ki, which you can use only to open or maintain chakras. These serpent-fire ki points are replenished at the same time you replenish the points in your regular ki pool.
