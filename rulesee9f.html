The First World shares its place in existence with the Material Plane, and in some places, the boundary between the planes wears thin. The Material Plane's influence on the First World manifests as regions of stubborn stability called "breach scars," which the First World's denizens regard with disgust. On the Material Plane, the fey realm's influence erodes the laws of time and space and transforms reality in its wake. Sometimes, this influence manifests as an echo of the First World.

An echo of the First World functions (and is designed) as a <a href="rules2924.html?Name=Haunts&amp;Category=Advanced%20Topics">haunt</a>, but unlike haunts, they are damaged by negative energy and healed by positive energy. These echoes can be any alignment, but they are almost always chaotic neutral. Three sample echoes are <a href="hauntsb610.html?ItemName=Dimensional%20Tear">Dimensional Tear</a>, <a href="hauntsd5c5.html?ItemName=Enchanting%20Demise">Enchanting Demise</a>, and <a href="hauntsd173.html?ItemName=Following%20Footsteps">Following Footsteps</a>, but countless others certainly exist.

Overcharge: Positive energy and healing effects heal echoes of the First World. If such healing would cause an echo of the First World to exceed its normal maximum hit points, it gains half the excess as temporary hit points until those hit points are spent or 1 minute has passed since it last gained temporary hit points in this manner. As long as an echo of the First World has at least 1 temporary hit point gained in this way, it also gains its overcharge ability.
