You've learned to gain the upper hand against your enemies by charging at them with feigned abandon, yet gaining a strong grip on them after attacking.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay371b.html?ItemName=Charging%20Stag%20Style">Charging Stag Style</a>, <a href="featdisplayfa6f.html?ItemName=Dodge">Dodge</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaya042.html?ItemName=Mobility">Mobility.</a>

Benefit:  While using Charging Stag Style, if you make a successful unarmed attack at the end of a charge, you can attempt a free grapple check against the target of your charge without provoking an attack of opportunity.

Normal:  Attempting a grapple requires a standard action, which provokes an attack of opportunity from your target unless you have the Improved Grapple feat.
