Attacking you during your period of vigilance opens foes up to allies' strikes.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay169d.html?ItemName=Archon%20Diversion">Archon Diversion</a>; <a href="featdisplaycb16.html?ItemName=Archon%20Style">Archon Style</a>; <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>; <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>; base attack bonus +8 or monk level 7th.

Benefit: You no longer take a penalty to AC for using Archon Style to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC, and you can activate this effect as a swift action or a move action. Whenever you take damage from an attack you diverted to yourself using Archon Diversion, each ally threatening the attacking creature can make an attack of opportunity against that creature.
