Tactics

Before Combat The barbarian uses her wand of shield before most battles, but also uses her wand of mirror image if she expects a difficult fight or a battle against a strong lone enemy.
During Combat The barbarian closes quickly to make full attacks with her hooked hammer, using the thundering pick end as her primary weapon and the hammer as her off-hand attack. If she has to charge or otherwise move between attacks, she makes a single two-handed Power Attack with the pick end. She uses moment of clarity to trigger a wand or scroll if the situation demands, such as in an encounter with a flying or invisible foe. She prefers to reserve her boots of speed for when she is already in melee, to facilitate full attacks or to close the distance on faster enemies.

An oddity among their kind, arcane experimenters use knowledge of magic to sow confusion on the battlefield.

Krida Grichenwald

Krida studies the link between emotional states and magic. Though she's so far been unable to focus her rage into magic, she believes it is only a matter of time. When friends and family tried to dissuade her, Krida quite literally sacrificed them, murdering some swiftly in paranoid vengeance but gruesomely torturing others in her search for non-existent magical secrets.

Combat Encounters: Krida's obsession drives her to attack those who obviously possess magic items.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Krida may search out spellcasters in order to pick their brains about rage magic, but she soon becomes frustrated and hostile to them.
