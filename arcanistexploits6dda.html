Type Exploit of the Outer Rifts
The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to manifest a choir of insidious whispers, which echo in the mind of a single target within 30 feet, urging the target to harm itself. A creature that fails a Will save to resist this effect becomes overwhelmed by the voices and succumbs to their suggestions. On its turn, it drops any objects it holds and harms itself, inflicting 1d6 points of damage. At 3rd level, and again at every 3 levels thereafter, the arcanist can target an additional creature with this exploit, to a maximum of 7 targets at 18th level. Damnation susurrus is a mind-affecting effect.
