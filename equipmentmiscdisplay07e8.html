Description

The menacing, eyeless masks of Hellknight signifers were first created by members of the Order of the Gate and are semitransparent on the inside. Those who wear them are treated as if they were wearing smoked goggles (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 72). A character with the Hellknight signifer prestige class (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Paths of Prestige 28) can see through the mask as normal, but can also adjust her mask as a standard action to function as a pair of smoked goggles once more. Signifer masks are often enhanced, becoming variants of items that take up the head item slot. Additionally, when a character takes levels in the Hellknight signifer prestige class, this mask grants the benefits and capabilities of the signifer mask supernatural ability.
