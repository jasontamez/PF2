Special Abilities

Blessing of the Harrow (Su) Once per day, a harrower may spend 10 minutes to perform a harrowing for himself and all allies within 20 feet to gain an insight bonus that lasts 24 hours based upon the suit with the most cards showing after the reading. In the case of a tie, the harrower chooses one suit. Strength: +1 on attack rolls; Dexterity: +1 to AC; Constitution: +1 on all skill checks; Intelligence: +1 on all skill checks; Wisdom: +1 on all saving throws; Charisma: +1 on all caster level and concentration checks.

Harrow Casting (Su) As he casts a spell, the harrower can draw three cards from his Harrow deck. This adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the Harrow deck) to the spell, but does not increase the spell's casting time. Each card the harrower draws of the Intelligence or Strength suits grants the benefit of the tower of intelligence or tower of strength abilities, respectively. Each card the harrower draws that exactly matches his alignment counts as two cards of that suit. Cards drawn from the other four suits provide no benefits. A spell cannot be affected by both Harrow casting and a metamagic feat.

Far from mere fortune tellers, harrowers use their mystical powers to advise their clans, bring doom upon their foes, and uphold the ancient and mysterious traditions of the Varisian wanderers.
