Description

This +1 sling looks mundane, but its true ability is revealed when its wielder hurls a bullet with it. Song-o halflings often use these slings to hunt hard-to-hit game. When the wielder of a scatter sling makes a ranged attack with the weapon using a nonmagical bullet as ammunition, she can have the bullet fragment into sharp pieces, dealing 1d3 points of piercing damage to each target in a 15-foot cone. She rolls the attack once and compares the result against the AC of each creature in the area of effect.
