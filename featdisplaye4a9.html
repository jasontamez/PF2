When you are close to death, your body can convert pesh into lifesaving medicine.

Prerequisites: Sahir-Afiyun or pesh addict.

Benefit:  If you are brought to 0 or fewer hit points while under the initial effect of pesh, you can end the drug's initial effect as an immediate action. If you do, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your Constitution score. These temporary hit points last 1 hour. Upon using this feat, you are sickened for 1d6 hours.
