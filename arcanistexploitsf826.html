An arcanist who selects this arcanist exploit learns an <a href="_wizardarcanediscoveries.html">arcane discovery</a>. When she learns an arcane discovery, her level must be high enough for her to qualify for that discovery, using half her arcanist level as her wizard level to determine whether she qualifies. The effects of any arcane discovery that she selects with this exploit apply only to arcanist spells that she casts, not to wizard spells, and she cannot select an arcane discovery in place of a feat (unless she also has wizard levels, in which case the discovery applies only to her wizard spells).
