Tactics

Before Combat The sorcerer casts bear's endurance, false life, fly, mage armor, and see invisibility.
During Combat The sorcerer prefers to fight with her electricity spells, such as chain lightning and lightning bolt, and saves her breath weapon until her foes are lined up so she can catch as many as possible in its effect. She uses spells such as black tentacles, grease, and ice storm to hinder her opponents. If forced into melee combat, the sorcerer casts haste and form of the dragon I.
Base Statistics Without bear's endurance, false life, fly, and mage armor, the sorcerer's statistics are AC 18, touch 15, flat-footed 15; hp 126; Fort +8; Speed 30 ft.

An azure bolt sorcererbelieves she is smarter than she actually is, and spins wild schemes to make herself feel important.

Sesserand

Sesserand has always been a small person, a lackey to others, only coming into her own when her magic awakened. Now she makes up for years of insults by preparing and memorizing cutting remarks for every possible slight, not realizing her power and inner strength are more than enough to garner respect despite her shortcomings.

Combat Encounters: Sesserand prefers to have lackeys engage enemies so she can freely choose targets to destroy. She might serve as a lieutenant to a wittier person who can make her feel important.

Roleplaying Encounters: Sesserand might work for a charismatic person who values her abilities, or might tell herself that she's the "power behind the throne" in an unequal partnership.
