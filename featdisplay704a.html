Your blending of conversation and martial prowess makes it difficult for opponents to slip past your guard.

Prerequisites: Bluff 1 rank, weapon training class feature, gnome.

Benefit: When you successfully feint against an opponent in combat, instead of denying the opponent his Dexterity bonus, you may gain a dodge bonus to your AC against his attacks. This bonus is equal to your weapon training bonus for your current weapon. The bonus lasts until combat ends, you switch opponents, or you switch to a different weapon, whichever comes first.
