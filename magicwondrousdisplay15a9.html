Description

Often created by those who venerate Trelmarixian, the Horseman of Famine, this dark leather belt has a piece of a cracked soul gem in its plain brass buckle. the wearer of a belt of Trelmarixian doesn't need to eat and is immune to the effects of starvation, though she begins to take on an emaciated appearance after several days. Three times per day, the wearer can touch a creature (requiring a successful touch melee attack) to affect it with incredibly painful pangs of hunger. If the target fails a DC 15 Fortitude save, it takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and is fatigued. Creatures that don't need to eat or are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this ability.
