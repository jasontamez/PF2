Occult Rituals








Occult Rituals

It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.

While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.<a href="rules4c69.html?Name=Occult%20Rituals&amp;Category=Occult%20Rules">Click here for the full rules on Occult Rituals.</a>

Effect

The primary caster juggles the <a href="magicwondrousdisplayccac.html?FinalName=%Chaos%20Emerald">chaos emerald</a> back and forth between his hands, under his clothing, and between any secondary casters involved in the ritual. As the ritual progresses, the primary caster's actions with the chaos emerald become increasingly improbable (putting it into his mouth and pulling it out of his ear, for example, or placing it into the cupped hands of one secondary caster and removing it from the cupped hands of a different secondary caster). If the ritual is successful, the chaos emerald disappears entirely, and the primary caster gains the ability to inflict warpwaves like a <a href="monsterfamilies681d.html?ItemName=Protean">protean</a> for the ritual's duration. The primary caster can inflict a warpwave on a creature within 100 feet as a standard action. The target can negate the effects of the warpwave with a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the primary caster's character level + the primary caster's Charisma modifier). When the duration expires, the chaos emerald reappears in the primary caster's possession-usually in a hidden place, such as the bottom of a backpack or inside a hat.
