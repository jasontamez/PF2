Special Abilities

Breath Weapon (Su) An inubrix golem can expel a 15-foot cone of yellowish gas as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. Creatures within the gas cloud feel their skin crawl and their senses deaden. Each creature within the area must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds and gain 1 negative level. The save DC to remove these negative levels is equal to the initial saving throw for the breath weapon.

Immunity to Iron (Ex) Inubrix golems ignore the presence of iron and are able to pass through it as if they were incorporeal. They are immune to iron weapons, and their attacks ignore any armor or shield bonus to AC (including enhancement bonuses) from iron armor and shields. These abilities also affect variations of iron such as cold iron, living steel, and steel.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An inubrix golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. <ul><li>A magical attack that deals fire damage slows an inubrix golem (as per <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a>) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. </li><li>A magical attack that deals cold damage dispels any <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a> effect on the golem and restores 1 hit point for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points for 1 hour. An inubrix golem receives no saving throw against cold effects. </li><li>An inubrix golem targeted by <a href="spelldisplay3d95.html?ItemName=transmute%20metal%20to%20wood">transmute metal to wood</a> permanently loses its immunity to iron and damage reduction, but it gains hardness 5.</li></ul> Razor Fingers (Ex) An inubrix golem's claws are razor sharp and threaten a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

Description

These deadly golems are crafted with a technique that incorporates inubrix, a rare skymetal, into their bodies. Due to the extraordinary material used in their construction, these golems are extremely rare throughout most of Golarion, found only in places with access to skymetals or in places where those who can afford such unique materials reside. Inubrix's unique characteristics allow it to pass through iron and steel without any impact, as if it existed slightly out of phase with such metals. This strange property has given it the nickname of "ghost iron." Weaponsmiths were initially excited to learn that it could penetrate metal armor with ease. However, the soft metal is too malleable for effective crafting; weapons made from inubrix are weaker than their normal counterparts, making them less effective. Alloys of inubrix with other metals failed to maintain its unique property to phase through iron, causing many smiths to see it as a strange curiosity and nothing of practical value.

Because of its ghostlike properties, the odd metal has also earned a reputation for being related to necromancy, gluttony, and temperance. Some spellcasters report spectacular effects when using inubrix in the creation of magic items associated with necromancy, as the metal tends to accept magical enhancements from that magic school more readily than from other schools of magic. This has led enterprising golem crafters to create the first inubrix golems. Rather than being imbued with an elemental spirit like many golems, inubrix golems gain their animating spark from negative energy, which seems to resonate particularly well with the inubrix used in their construction.

Though creators can craft these golems into any configuration they desire, most form inubrix golems that have a skeletal aesthetic. This grotesque appearance only adds to the necromantic mystique of the golem, its visage promising the one thing these monstrosities can deliver: a brush with death. These 11-foot-tall creations weigh about 5,000 pounds, but their <a href="spelldisplay274d.html?ItemName=air%20walk">air walk</a> ability allows them to navigate difficult and unstable terrain with ease. They cannot speak, though at times their metal bodies emit a low bass rumble.

Technic League engineers created the first inubrix golems in the golem forges of Numeria. Their captains hoped to use them as scouts and shock troops when exploring the vast and dangerous metal ruins that speckle the landscape. However, their inability to communicate makes inubrix golems poor scouts, and the properties bestowed from their inubrix components left them often unable to harm the robotic contraptions they were sent to destroy. Their use as bodyguards is limited, as they cannot stop or deflect iron weapons, but they make decent assassins and excellent traps when hidden behind a wall of iron. Enterprising captains used the creatures to attack and assassinate their rivals, but it wasn't long before Technic League officers started to line their strongholds with lead and other materials that the golems can't pass through.

Variant Inubrix Golems

As other golem crafters experimented with the original inubrix golems, they discovered viable variants, including those below.

Abysibrix Golem (CR +0): By creating an alloy of inubrix and abysium, a glowing blue-green skymetal that makes creatures sick through exposure, a golem crafter can make a sturdier golem, but at the cost of its ability to phase through iron. These golems lose their immunity to iron and rend abilities, but their entire body is infused with a green-blue glow. They increase their damage reduction to 10/adamantine, and they leave behind a poisonous abysium residue with every successful claw attack.

Abysium Residue: Claw-touch; save Fortitude DC 20; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1d2 Con damage plus nauseated; cure 2 saves.

Ghost Metal Golem (CR +0): Ghost metal golems are enhanced specifically for assassination tasks. These golems take a more aggressive and bloodthirsty approach to combat, though they still follows all of their creators' commands. Ghost metal golems lose their rend special attack and breath weapon, but gain the ability to deal an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage with each claw attack, and they can cast <a href="spelldisplayae66.html?ItemName=ethereal%20jaunt">ethereal jaunt</a> as a spell-like ability three times per day.

Construction

The creator must sculpt an inubrix golem's body from 80,000 gp worth of inubrix and treat it with rare unguents worth 10,000 gp.

Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They stand apart from other constructs in the nature of their animating force-golems are granted their magical life via an elemental spirit, typically that of an earth elemental. The process of creating a golem binds the spirit to the artificial body, merging it with this specially prepared vessel and subjecting it to the will of the golem's creator.

Being mindless, golems do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow instructions explicitly and are incapable of complex strategy or tactics. A golem's creator can command it if the golem is within 60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a simple command to govern its actions in his absence, or can order the golem to obey the commands of another, but the golem's creator can always resume control by commanding the golem to obey him alone.


Constructing a Golem

The cost to create a golem includes the cost of the physical body and all the materials and spell components used in its creation. Each golem entry gives specific details on the materials required and the total cost for its creation.

Note: The market price of a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical golem described in each entry is increased by 5,000 gp for each additional Hit Die it possesses beyond the standard for its kind, and increases by an additional 50,000 gp if the golem's size increases. Building a golem with the advanced simple template increases its cost by 15,000 gp.


Shield Guardians

A spellcaster with enough talent, resources, and inspiration can create a special variant of a golem known as a shield guardian. Any true golem can be created as a shield guardian, but the choice to do so must be made during the golem's construction-a completed golem cannot later be "upgraded" to function as a shield guardian.

Shield guardians are designed to serve as bodyguards. When created, a shield guardian is keyed to a magical amulet that is constructed at the same time as (and as part of the cost of) the guardian. Henceforth, it regards the wearer of that amulet as its master, protecting and following that individual everywhere (unless specifically commanded not to do so). If a shield guardian's amulet is destroyed, the guardian ceases to function until a new one is created. If the wearer dies but the amulet is intact, the shield guardian carries out the last command it was given.

A shield guardian obeys its master's verbal commands to the best of its ability, although it is not good for much beyond combat, protection, and simple manual labor. It can also be keyed to perform specific tasks at specific times or when certain conditions are met. The wearer of the amulet can call the shield guardian from any distance, and it will come as long as it is on the same plane.

Shield guardians have the same statistics as the base golem, but with the following additional special qualities. A shield guardian's CR is equal to the base golem's CR + 2.

Controlled (Ex) A shield guardian that has the berserk special attack cannot go berserk as long as the wearer of its amulet is within 30 feet.

Fast Healing (Ex) A shield guardian has fast healing 5.

Find Master (Su) As long as a shield guardian and its amulet are on the same plane, the shield guardian can locate the amulet's wearer (or just the amulet, if it is removed after the guardian is called).

Guard (Ex) If ordered to do so, a shield guardian moves to defend the wearer of its amulet. All attacks against the amulet wearer take a -2 penalty when the shield guardian is adjacent to its master.

Shield Other (Sp) The wearer of a shield guardian's amulet can activate this defensive ability as a standard action if within 100 feet of the shield guardian. Just as the spell of the same name, this ability transfers to the shield guardian half the damage that would be dealt to the amulet wearer (note that this ability does not provide the spell's AC or save bonuses). Damage transferred in this manner bypasses any defensive abilities (such as immunity or damage reduction) the golem possesses.

Spell Storing (Sp) A shield guardian can store one spell of 4th level or lower that is cast into it by another creature. It "casts" this spell when commanded to do so or when a predefined situation arises. Once this spell is used, the shield guardian can store another spell (or the same spell again).

Construction: A shield guardian's base materials cost an additional 25,000 gp above the base golem's cost. The creature's master may assemble the body or hire someone else to do the job. The Craft check required to make the body is 4 higher than normal for the base golem's kind. The keyed amulet is fashioned at the same time-it costs 20,000 gp above and beyond the shield guardian's total cost. After the body is sculpted, the shield guardian is animated through an extended magical ritual that requires a specially prepared laboratory or workroom, similar to an alchemist's laboratory and costing 500 gp to establish. If the creator is personally constructing the creature's body, the building and the ritual can be performed together. The creator must have a minimum caster level of 2 higher than the base golem's minimum required caster level. In addition, the following spells are added to the base golem's requirements: discern location and either shield or shield other.
