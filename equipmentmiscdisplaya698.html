Description

These small capsules consist of a concentrated mix of nausea-inducing herbs. To use a capsule, you bite down and ingest its contents, which almost immediately cause you to projectile vomit. The vomiting lasts 1 full round, during which you can take no other actions. The following round you recover fully, and suffer no other ill effects. These capsules are most often used by rogues working in teams to create distractions and spectacles in order to draw people's attention away from their activities, as well as by those interested in faking illness, such as pugilists trying to throw fights or criminals seeking to create chaos during an arrest.
