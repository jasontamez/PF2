Your fighting style emulates the disciplined nature of the kytons, with passion and pain held tightly in chains.

Prerequisites: Wis 13, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain)</a>, Knowledge (planes) 3 ranks, ki pool class feature.

Benefit: When using this style, you treat spiked chains as if they had the monk special weapon feature. Additionally, if you have Stunning Fist, you can spend 1 point from your ki pool to make a Stunning Fist attack with your spiked chain instead of an unarmed strike. This still costs a use of Stunning Fist as normal.
