There are few things more terrifying than a half-orc barbarian with a greataxe.

Bloody Barru

Bloody Barru licks the blood from her axe each time she fells a foe.

Combat Encounters: Bloody Barru allies with almost anyone who promises excessive carnage.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Barru is hard to get along with. She would rather kill a person than engage in conversation.
