Monkey Swarm

Screeches and bestial calls precede this pack of monkeys, each primate propelling itself forward on calloused knuckles.

Special Abilities

Coordinated Swarm (Ex) A monkey swarm coordinates its attacks more than a typical swarm, and deals swarm damage one step higher than a swarm of its HD would normally cause.

Description

Monkeys sometimes travel in huge colonies of hundreds of individuals. In such quantities, these primates can become quite dangerous, capable of overwhelming many foes by their sheer numbers.

Unlike most swarms, monkey swarms work well together. A swarm of monkeys does not possess a true hive mind, but it is capable of working in tandem with other swarms to make basic tactical decisions in combat.
