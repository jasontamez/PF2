Adventuring is a dangerous career, and sometimes an animal companion, cohort, or familiar dies or is lost. A change in your alignment or religion might drive away your cohort, or the cohort's role in the story might end based on discussion between you and the GM. An extended voyage in a dangerous environment might convince a druid to free a trusted companion that would otherwise suffer and die if forced to travel (such as a polar bear in the desert). A ranger might discover a rare specimen of a favorite type of creature and want to claim it as his own in order to protect it from poachers. Regardless of the cause, when a companion dies or is lost, you need to replace it. This creates an opportunity for roleplaying.

A lost animal companion, cohort, familiar, or follower can be raised or resurrected with spells such as <a href="spelldisplay0d07.html?ItemName=raise%20dead">raise dead</a>, <a href="spelldisplayd65d.html?ItemName=resurrection">resurrection</a>, or <a href="spelldisplayb1f3.html?ItemName=true%20resurrection">true resurrection</a>. For a cohort or follower with character levels, these kinds of spells give the character one or more negative levels-a price worth paying if the alternative is death. Creatures with no character levels (such as animal companions and familiars) count as 1st level for the purpose of these spells, and therefore they take Constitution drain instead of negative levels. A nonsentient companion is assumed to be willing to return to life unless you were cruel to it or directly responsible for its death.

In most cases, the companion probably remembers its last moments alive and understands that you're the reason why it is alive again. For a lower-level cohort or a non-adventuring follower, the gift of a second chance at life is something very treasured and earns you great respect and devotion. You can gain the reputation of "fairness and generosity" for the purposes of the <a href="featdisplay4b4e.html?ItemName=Leadership">Leadership</a> feat.

Using <a href="spelldisplay0315.html?ItemName=reincarnate">reincarnate</a> is an alternative option, but has a similar effect on a companion's loyalty and affection. Few humans would choose to be reincarnated as a bugbear or kobold, but if the choice is that or death, a new life in a new body is generally preferred. For an animal companion, the GM should create a random table of creatures similar to its original form-for example, a lion might be reincarnated as a leopard, cheetah, or tiger.

In some cases, replacing an animal companion or familiar can be as easy as purchasing an animal of the desired type and declaring it your new companion. <a href="classdisplay477d.html?ItemName=Familiar">Attuning a familiar to its new master requires a ritual</a>. <a href="classdisplay4c10.html?ItemName=Companion">Choosing an animal companion requires 24 hours of prayer</a>. The ceremony can also be used to attract and bond with an animal appropriate to the local environment. However, you might want to wait for the campaign to present an appropriate companion, such as an animal you rescue from a cruel enemy that you tame with the ritual or ceremony. In terms of game mechanics, there is no difference between any of these options, and you should work with the GM to find a replacement method that is appropriate to the campaign.

Replacing a lost or killed cohort or follower involves a similar collaboration between you and the GM to create a character who is appropriate for the campaign and valuable to you (and hopefully to the rest of the party). You might want to elevate a follower to a cohort, select another known NPC to become a cohort, or start from scratch by introducing a new NPC to the party. Keep in mind that your Leadership score might have changed, especially if you were responsible for the previous cohort's death-and that sort of tragedy creates roleplaying opportunities for the new cohort.
