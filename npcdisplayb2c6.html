The profane general, a powerful cleric of war who leads by example, cleaves through enemies to inspire her allies and followers to greater glory and victory.

Birn Hengdel

Birn became a mercenary when her unit was cut off and her home city fell. Over the years, she has gathered many warriors under her banner. She lives only for battle, refusing to become attached to followers she may have to sacrifice.

Combat Encounters: Birn loyally serves whoever pays her, so she might face the PCs while in the employ of any villain.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Because she works for the highest bidder, Birn might just switch sides if given a better offer.
