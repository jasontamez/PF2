Description

This heavy warhammer is capped with steel spikes on both ends of its massive head, and a leather thong prevents it from falling from the wielder’s hand. Molvënn is a +3 warhammer that deals both piercing and bludgeoning damage. Yet although it is already a formidable weapon, its true potential is only realized in the hands of a barbarian.

Wielded by a barbarian, Molvënn becomes a +5 thundering warhammer. The barbarian gains an additional 1 hit point per barbarian level when raging and can add twice her Strength modifier (instead of half again her Strength modifier) to damage rolls while wielding Molvënn two-handed. Additionally, while Molvënn’s wielder is raging, she cannot be disarmed, nor can Molvënn be sundered.
