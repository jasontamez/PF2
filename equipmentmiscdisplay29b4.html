Description

Sylirican lemons make prized preserves when ground, salted, and sealed in jars, adding an intense citrus flavor when sprinkled atop other foods. If, within 8 hours of consuming a meal seasoned with Sylirican lemons, you gain the confused condition, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the result from the result of your d% roll to determine what action you take for the first round in which you are confused. This benefit does not stack with itself. The price and weight listed represent a jar containing enough preserved lemons to season 10 meals.
