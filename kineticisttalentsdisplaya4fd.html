Your kinetic blast pulls foes toward you. Attempt a drag combat maneuver check against each target damaged by your infused blast (the blast always drags the foe closer to you), using your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine your CMB. This infusion can pull a foe a maximum of 5 feet. You can increase the maximum distance pulled by 5 feet per additional point of burn accepted.
