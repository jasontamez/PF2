Your close bond with an animal allows you to ignore harmful magic that cannot affect your wild side.

Prerequisites: Animal companion or mount class feature.

Benefit: You can choose not to allow spells and effects to effect you if they would not be capable of affecting both your original creature type and the animal creature type.
