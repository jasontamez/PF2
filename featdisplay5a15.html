You and an ally can amplify the effects of beneficial spells.

Prerequisites: Spellcraft 5 ranks.

Benefit: Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat and both of you are affected by the same spell or spell-like ability, you may amplify the spell's effect on yourself. As an immediate action as the spell affects you and your ally, you can increase the effective caster level of the spell by 3. This increase in caster level doesn't affect the spell's duration or the effects for any target of the spell other than yourself. The increase doesn't stack with any other effects that might increase the spell's caster level.
