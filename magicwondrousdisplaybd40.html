Description

This thick leather cloak is charred and blackened around
the edges and smells faintly of soot. Once per day, when
subject to an effect that deals fire damage, the wearer can
spend an immediate action while obscured by the flames
to become invisible, leaving behind an illusory pile of
ashes and bones, as if he had been slain by the fire effect.
The wearer's invisibility and his illusory remains last for 5
rounds or until the wearer attacks any creature. Creatures
that study or interact with the ashes can make a DC 11 Will
save to disbelieve the illusion, though this does not end the
invisibility effect.
