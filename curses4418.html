Type curse; Save Will DC 17
Effect The victim is haunted by a <%MOSNTERS%Ghost%%ghost</a> as described in <a href="cursesd1c6.html?ItemName=Haunting,%20Minor">minor haunting</a>.
Cure Unlike a minor haunting, a major haunting can be ended only by putting the ghost to rest, though casting <a href="spelldisplay52f1.html?ItemName=remove%20curse">remove curse</a> directly after the ghost is destroyed prevents it from reviving for 2d4 days.
