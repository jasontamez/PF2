As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, when you use a melee weapon that is not a thrown weapon for a ranged improvised weapon attack, you use the weapon's melee critical threat range and multiplier instead of the normal 20/??2 for improvised weapons. You can spend 2 stamina points to increase your range increment for thrown weapon attacks (including ranged improvised weapons) by 10 feet until the beginning of your next turn.

Mythic Throw Anything

You're so skilled at throwing weapons that it hardly matters what you throw.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8204.html?ItemName=Throw%20Anything">Throw Anything.</a>

Benefit:  You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made using an improvised thrown weapon or splash weapon. This bonus stacks with the bonus from the non-mythic Throw Anything feat. If you miss with a thrown splash weapon, it always lands adjacent to its target regardless of how many range increments it was thrown.
