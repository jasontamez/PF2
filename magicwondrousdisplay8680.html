Description

Shaped like a fist, this iron amulet is surrounded by a frigid
fog. On command, this amulet causes the wearer's hands
to become encased in a layer of freezing iron. The wearer is
protected from the frigid cold and can make savage blows with
his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer
makes with hands gain the frost weapon special ability and
are treated as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage
reduction. The wearer's hands become rigid while using this
amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects
(unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club
and is not damaged by cold). The transformation can be ended
as a swift action.
