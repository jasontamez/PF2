Description

Phase lurching armor takes on a shifting and immaterial appearance and radiates ghostly clouds of ectoplasm. The wearer of phase lurching armor has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles once per day as a move action. The wall or obstacle can be up to 5 feet thick, and the wearer moves through it as if it were ethereal. The wearer is not considered ethereal for any other purpose, and can't move through corporeal creatures or through force effects (such as a wall of force) using this ability. Any surface the character moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute. The phase lurching special ability can be applied only to light armor.
