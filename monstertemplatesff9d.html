Frostfallen creatures are mindless undead infused with icy cold and animated by a hatred for all living things. Their bodies radiate a devastating chill that cloaks them in patches of ice that act as armor. Frostfallen creatures appear otherwise as they did at the time of their reanimation, except for a cold gleam in the eyes.


"Frostfallen creature" is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead), referred to hereafter as the base creature. A frostfallen creature uses the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

CR: As base creature + 1.

Alignment: Always neutral evil.

Type: The creature's type changes to undead and it gains the cold subtype. It retains any subtypes except for alignment subtypes (such as good) and subtypes that indicate kind (such as giant). It does not gain the augmented subtype. It uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

Armor Class: The natural armor bonus improves by +4.

Hit Dice: A frostfallen creature drops any HD gained from class levels and changes racial HD to d8s. Creatures without racial HD are treated as if they had 1 racial HD. A skeleton uses its Charisma modifier (instead of its Constitution modifier) to determine bonus hit points.

Defensive Abilities: Frostfallen creatures gain DR 5/ bludgeoning (or DR 10/bludgeoning if it has 11 HD or more). They are immune to cold.

Weaknesses: Frostfallen creatures gain vulnerability to fire.

Speed: A winged frostfallen creature's maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature f lew magically, its f ly speed is unchanged. Retain all other movement types.

Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the frostfallen creature's size, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size.

Special Attacks: A frostfallen creature retains all of the base creature's special attacks and also gains the following.

Cold (Su): A frostfallen creature's body generates intense cold, dealing an amount of cold damage with its touch determined by its Hit Dice. Creatures attacking a frostfallen creature with unarmed strikes or natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of their attacks hits. <table class="inner"> <tr><td>Frostfallen Creature Hit Dice</td><td>Cold Damage</td></tr> <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6</td></tr> <tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6</td></tr> <tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6</td></tr> <tr><td>16+</td><td>4d6</td></tr></table>

Skills: A frostfallen creature loses all skill ranks possessed by the base creature and gains none of its own.
