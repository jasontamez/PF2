Description

This map aids in navigating a single city. You can consult the map for 1 minute to gain a +2 bonus when attempting a Knowledge (local) check to identify a location in that city (and can attempt checks for DCs above 10 even if untrained) or when attempting a DC 15 Survival check to avoid getting lost in that city.
