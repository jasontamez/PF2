Adaros (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 7) are frightful creatures with the upper bodies of muscular humanoids, the lower bodies of sleek sharks, and enormous jaws filled with razor-sharp teeth. Nomadic predators of the deep, adaros travel in packs through tropical waters, hunting their prey with poisoned spears and then devouring the victims raw. Adaros willingly feed on humans, merfolk, and other sentient creatures.

Adaro adventurers are the rare shark-people who have learned to control their bloodlust to achieve a long-term goal, such as conquering a large territory, plundering a submerged city, or working alongside other creatures to stop a greater threat.
