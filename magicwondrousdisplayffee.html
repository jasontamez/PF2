Description

This rough vest of black snakeskin is
decorated with a fringe of rawhide
tassels, each knotted around a bit
of bone or a small animal skull. A
gunslinger with the deadeye deed
reduces the grit point cost to use that
deed by 1 (minimum 1 grit).


In addition, once per day when the
wearer reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a
firearm she can use death knell (Will DC 13 negates) against
that target as a swift action. She does not have to touch
the target to activate this ability, but her range increment
penalty for shooting the target also applies to the saving
throw DC of the death knell (for example, if the range
increment penalty is -2, the DC is 11).
