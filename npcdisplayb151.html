A ruffian makes a living by petty theft and robbery when he isn't working with a larger gang. Lacking the motivation to learn a profitable trade, a ruffian has spent a lifetime at hard unskilled labor, and isn't afraid to throw his weight around to get what he wants.

Ruffians are employed anywhere brute strength is more important than skill or finesse and getting it done cheaply is better than getting it done well. Miners use ruffians to push carts; farmers hire them to load wagons; merchants, thieves' guilds, and cults use them as enforcers and guards; and street gangs enlist them to bolster their numbers.
