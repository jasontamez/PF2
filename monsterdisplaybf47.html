Hiracapath - Monsters







Hiracapath

Silvery armor in the shape of a powerful ram barely contains the brilliant radiance shining from within it, and curling, steel horns emerge from its helm.

Special Abilities

Glorious Nimbus (Su) A hiracapath sheds the blinding light of righteous loyalty, which burns betrayers and staggers deceivers. Their radiance increases the light level within the area of the aura by one step and counts as magical light equivalent to a continual light spell for the purposes of dispelling magical darkness. Chaotic- or evil-aligned creatures that make a successful melee attack against a hiracapath take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Chaotic evil creatures suffer 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from striking the hiracapath while within the aura.

Nonlethal Mastery (Ex) A hiracapath can deal nonlethal damage with any of its natural attacks without taking a penalty on the attack roll. When making nonlethal attacks, the hiracapath increases the critical threat range on all natural attacks to 19-20.

Description

Hiracapaths are inhabitants of Heaven-outsiders formed from the celestial plane-but they are not true angels or archons. They exist below the lowest tiers of Heaven's hierarchy and are commanders of celestial animals, holding no official place among Heaven's formal ranks or society. They dwell primarily at the base of the mountain that makes up the plane, wandering the idyllic realm alone or in great, golden herds. Despite their placid appearances, hiracapaths act as Heaven's watchdogs, running down any discovered interlopers and dragging them before more formal authorities for judgment. To hiracapaths, this arrangement is not lopsided; rather, it's preferable, as it allows them to indulge in their natural affinity for tracking intruders while remaining outside of the official celestial hierarchy, which they find too complex and unappealing, when they even consider the matter at all.

In its natural form, a hiracapath is as an intangible cloud of soulstuff and celestial energy. Heaven itself provides each glorious creature with silver and steel armor to give it both form and purpose. Clad in gleaming plates, a hiracapath stands 9 feet tall and weighs almost 1,500 pounds.

Ecology

Sometimes called the "bulls of Heaven," hiracapaths are born from Heaven itself, often forming from the souls of loyal mounts and animal companions of righteous heroes. Newly formed hiracapaths burst forth as jets of light and sound from the ground of Heaven's lowest tiers. Their armor eventually emerges from these same fonts hours later, beginning a long process that is equal parts birthing and unification of their disparate elements. The creatures remember nothing of their creation, and are driven only by an imbued sense of their place in the rigid hierarchy of Heaven's inhabitants.

The same force that empowers its existence allows a hiracapath to expertly sap the life energies from enemies without mortally wounding them. In spite of the hiracapath's bulk and size, its powerful blows strike an enemy carefully, and rarely draw blood or open wounds. Born trusting humanoid masters more than their own judgment, hiracapaths dread the possibility of accidentally injuring or killing a creature that deserved a kinder fate, and under no circumstances do they wish to pass judgment on any creatures themselves. Against foes immune to nonlethal damage'such as constructs or undead-a hiracapath simply wields its curled horns and powerful hooves to devastating effect, trusting that a soulless creature cannot feel the pain it brings, and hoping only to stop, rather than totally destroy, its opponent.

A hiracapath's intangible core grants it many benefits, including a shining light that burns evil and the disobedient, plus the ability to tread upon air as if its armor weighed nothing. This same holy light allows them to slip between the planes as they wish. Small populations wander Nirvana from time to time, or charge though the borders of Hell and the Maelstrom. As outsiders, they have no need to eat or sleep, but enjoy both-great herds roam Heaven, chewing thoughtfully at mouthfuls of plant matter, dirt, or stones, resembling contented herds of mortal cattle, sheep, or goats. If they spot an intruder, however, the hiracapaths do not hesitate to meet the threat head on, even if they don't wish to visit mortal harm upon it.

Habitat and Society

After their emergence at the base of Heaven's mountain, hiracapaths swiftly define their territory, or join other hiracapath herds without much fanfare. Instinctively knowing their role, hiracapaths serve as vigilant protectors, shepherding celestial animals and guarding against threats from other planes. They suspiciously stalk new petitioners and planar travelers alike, only satisfied when they see newcomers judged worthy by angels, archons, or other celestials. Obvious threats' such as the rare fiendish incursion-are dealt with swiftly but mercifully. A hiracapath carries incapacitated foes to the nearest authority figure, and ultimately loves nothing more than praise from its celestial superiors for a job well done.

When the threat of invasion is not a concern, hiracapaths enjoy the rigid beauty of heaven. Though herd animals, they can wander off alone to spend extended periods of time in simple but careful introspection. Bold and stubborn, hiracapaths are ultimately gentle creatures who dread the thought of causing undue harm; they move with careful grace across the fields and pastures they patrol to avoid crushing smaller creatures beneath their bulk. Hiracapaths follow a simplified paladin's code, refusing to hurt helpless opponents and offering assistance to those in need. Thanks to their dull wits and prodigious strength, a hiracapath is often painfully straightforward. For instance, a hiracapath may help a lost traveler by carrying her in a straight line-through any and all obstacles-until the traveler spies familiar surroundings. Or a hiracapath may lead a wayward visitor around the mountains in a winding or circular path, waiting until it comes across a trusted angel or archon who can help direct its charge.

While hiracapaths' dogged defense of Heaven seems at odds with their ability to plane shift, they do use their planar traveling ability to pursue enemies who escape justice. Angels joke that hiracapaths' ability to jump between worlds is a symptom of their stubbornness' even the walls of reality can't sway one of Heaven's bulls once it eyes a target. Because a hiracapath is unable to bring a target it pursues across cosmic borders, those beasts who leave their home often regretfully switch to deadly force, especially against infernal or other obviously evil prey.

Other times, high-ranking angels or archons gift the services of hiracapaths to virtuous mortals. The hiracapaths proudly serve as paladin mounts when so called-many filled this same role in life and vaguely recall the sense of purpose it offered. Though rare, such alliances offer valuable training a hiracapath can bring back to its herd, and the majestic beasts themselves serve as proud warriors and surprisingly capable trackers.

Though many angelic lords of Heaven view them as simple brutes and watchdogs, hiracapaths maintain a special relationship with the empyreal lord Ragathiel. The empyreal lord opens his territories to myriad herds of hiracapaths to serve as both protectors and symbols of strength, and respects the dogged and just nature of the hiracapaths, rewarding those who uproot nascent evils or track down escaped enemies. The General of Vengeance selects those hiracapaths who prove themselves worthy to wander the grounds within his own fortress, and dispatches them as mounts for his messengers and scouts in his wars against the infernal. These hiracapaths are clad in crimson-andgold armor, and their interior nimbuses of golden light are replaced with righteous fire. Such champions of their kind have the advanced simple creature template, and often possess unique abjuration and conjuration spell-like abilities.
