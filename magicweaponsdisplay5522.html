Description

This special ability can be placed only on ranged weapons. Whenever a tailwind weapon is used to make a ranged attack, the weapon or its projectile is pushed along by a powerful tailwind that fills its space. This tailwind acts similarly to the gust of wind spell, except it has an instantaneous duration and doesn't affect creatures. However, it can still extinguish unprotected flames and accomplish anything a sudden burst of wind could. The tailwind negates range penalties to the weapon's attack until it reaches the end of the wind's range (60 feet); each whole range increment beyond 60 feet applies a penalty to the attack as normal.
