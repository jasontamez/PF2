Your powers are attuned to the concentrated core of the elemental plane.

Associated Bloodline: Elemental.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell with an energy descriptor that matches your elemental bloodline's energy type, that spell deals +1 point of damage per die rolled.

Bloodline Powers: You can infuse raw energy into your summoned minions.

Elementalist Summoning (Su): At 9th level, whenever you summon a creature, it gains energy resistance 10 against the energy type that matches your elemental bloodline (if it already has such resistance, its resistance increases by +5), and its natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of damage of the same energy type. This bloodline power replaces elemental blast.
