Description

This special weapon ability can be placed on only melee weapons. When a character wielding a dazzling radiance weapon uses the Dazzling Display feat, the weapon flashes in a burst of bright color. All creatures within 15 feet of the wielder who can see the display must attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save. Those who fail are blinded for 2 rounds and dazzled for an additional 1d4 rounds; those who succeed are instead dazzled for 1d4 rounds.
