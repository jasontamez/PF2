Benefit: When negotiating with evil outsiders, you gain a +2 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks. You gain an amount of spell resistance equal to 5 + your character level against spells and spell-like abilities originating from outsiders with the evil subtype.

Goal: Receive a boon from an evil creature that is equivalent in value to a month's service or an 8th-level spell without becoming indebted to the creature or giving up anything in return. This cannot be the result of magical compulsion.
