Description

This iron ring is set with a polished bloodstone. When created, a ring of blood calling creates a link between a single mortal creature devoted to Asmodeus and a specific devil with no more than 12 Hit Dice who willingly agrees to be bound by the item. Once per day as a standard action, the ring's wearer can place a drop of his own blood on the ring's gem (provoking attacks of opportunity) to immediately call the devil linked to the ring to any space within 30 feet. While the wearer does not control the devil, most wearers make agreements with the devil linked to the ring for protection or some other service when called. The called devil remains for 1 hour, or the wearer can dismiss the devil as a free action.

If the devil linked to the ring is killed, the ring crumbles to dust. If wearer linked to the ring is killed, a new wearer can summon the linked devil, but can compel the devil to perform only one service, as per planar binding, which severs the devil's link to the ring when the task is completed unless the new wearer makes his own deal with the devil, reestablishing the link between the wearer, the devil, and the ring.

Nicolo Alazario's ring of blood calling is linked to a bone devil named Xanthut. If Nicolo is killed, the PCs will need to make their own arrangements with Xanthut to link themselves to the ring to call the devil.
