Sometimes smacking your firearm against a solid surface is all that's needed to unjam it. Sometimes that solid surface is a creature.

Prerequisites: Craft (alchemy) 3 ranks; grit class feature or Amateur Gunslinger; pistol-whip gunslinger deed; quick clear gunslinger deed.

Benefit: You can ignore the broken condition of a firearm you're wielding to perform the pistol-whip deed. If you hit a creature with this deed, you can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to remove the broken condition from the firearm, but only if the firearm gained that condition from a misfire.
