Concoctions

Some alchemical creations are less stable than others. Concoctions are notorious for their side effects and for their dangerous unpredictability when mixed together.

All concoctions last for 1 hour, even if their benefits are expended before then. Drinking a second concoction before this duration expires causes unpredictable effects as their unstable alchemical compounds mix inside the body. To determine the effects of admixture, roll on the Concoction Miscibility Table. For each additional concoction consumed before the initial duration expires, rolls on the Concoction Miscibility Table take a cumulative -10% penalty. Mixing concoctions outside the body ruins both substances' potency. All concoctions have a Craft DC of 15.
