When you hit an opponent with both a primary-hand attack and an off-hand attack while using Two-Weapon Fighting, you can spend a number of stamina points up to half your Strength bonus. If you do, add a bonus on the damage roll of the second of the two attacks equal to the number of stamina points you spent. You can use this combat trick only once per round.
