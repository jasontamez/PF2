Description

The iridescent, hazy contents of this glass container eddy briefly into different shapes. A bottled cloud can be thrown as a splash weapon. When it strikes, it unleashes a bank of whitish-gray, semi-solid clouds in one of two configurations-a 20-foot-radius cloud or a 40-foot-radius sheet of mist that hovers a few inches above the ground. The user selects which version of the clouds she wishes to create as she throws the bottled cloud.

If the bottled cloud forms a 20-foot-radius cloud, it functions as a <a href="spelldisplayf252.html?ItemName=solid%20fog">solid fog</a> spell.

If the bottled cloud is instead used to form a sheet, the layer of mist can be walked upon as if it were solid ground. While the bottled cloud must be thrown against solid ground in order to shatter the container and release the cloud, it can be deliberately poured out on a liquid surface to form a sheet as well. The cloud sheet extends over liquid surfaces, but pours into concavities and holes-one can use a bottled cloud to traverse water, but not a pit or chasm. The sheet of mist also allows safe movement over <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay79bd.html?ItemName=Caltrops">caltrops</a>, difficult terrain that lies low to the ground (GM's discretion), and other low-lying hazards (such as a sheet of <a href="rules1f79.html?Name=Slimes,%20Molds,%20and%20Fungi&amp;Category=Dungeon%20Terrain">green slime</a>) and traps that are triggered via pressure plates.

Either use of a bottled cloud can be dispersed by a severe wind (31+ mph) in a single round, but otherwise the effect created lasts for 3 minutes.
