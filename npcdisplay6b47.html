Masters at breaking into wizard towers and sorcerer societies, arcanothieves steal magic items, supplying local fences or selling directly to visiting adventurers.

Jilis Quickfingers

A strange little thief, Jilis cares little for the money or magic she steals. Instead, she enjoys the pure challenge of larceny. She started with simple scores, but her love of thieving quickly turned into an addiction. Like most addicts, she needed more potent fixes over time. It didn't take her long to discover that wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane spellcasters are extremely crafty when safeguarding their treasures. They present unique challenges that, when overcome, provide the rush she craves.

Combat Encounters:Jilis is not alone in her love for challenging theft. She often recruits like-minded rogues, sellswords, and even other spellcasters to aid her with particularly difficult capers.

Roleplaying Suggestions:Jolly and personable, Jilis is a fixture in many taverns favored by arcane spellcasters. She sidles up to patrons, plies them with drinks, and worms her way into their confidence to learn about how to trick magical wards and locals who might make good marks.
