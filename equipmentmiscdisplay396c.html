Description

This fabric vest contains pockets full of cork, providing the wearer additional buoyancy. Originally worn by fishers and sailors, it protects against drowning. While wearing a cork vest, you take a -2 penalty on Dexterity and Swim checks, but instead of going underwater after failing the check by 5 or more, you go underwater only if you fail by 10 or more. Additionally, you gain a +4 bonus on Swim checks to avoid damage from fatigue. The cork vest can be worn under armor.
