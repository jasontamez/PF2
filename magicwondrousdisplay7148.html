Description

These pigments enable their possessor
to create actual, permanent objects
simply by depicting their form in
two dimensions. The pigments are
applied by a stick tipped with bristles,
hair, or fur. The emulsion flows
from the application to form the desired object as the artist
concentrates on the image. One pot of marvelous pigments
is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it
two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.


Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures
can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface.
It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to
depict an object with the pigments. Marvelous pigments
cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the
pigments-precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on-
appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass,
brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item
(including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp.
The effect is instantaneous.
