Description

Scarab beetles often mass in swarms and terrorize remote
desert regions. These vermin are a threat to ancient tombs
as they chew their way through the interred.

A scarab swarm comprises thousands of scarab beetles,
each filthy from its constant contact with dung and carrion.
Normally inattentive toward other creatures, scarab swarms
subject those who get in their way to thousands of sharp
bites as well as an infectious disease. Indeed, the bites of a
scarab swarm are the least of their victims' worries, as the
disease they carry claims far more lives than their hunger.

Some religious scholars theorize that scarabs are prone
to swarming because they're drawn to the same malign
energy that causes undead to rise, though most people
regard this explanation as pure superstition. Some
worshipers of gods of death see the arrival of a scarab
swarm as a portent of ill fortune.
