You are able to glean insight from your momentary meditation longer than most.

Prerequisites: Wis 15, <a href="featdisplayc271.html?ItemName=Combat%20Meditation">Combat Meditation</a>, <a href="featdisplayade4.html?ItemName=Meditation%20Master">Meditation Master</a>, character level 11th.

Benefit: When you meditate, you gain a +2 insight bonus instead of a +1 insight bonus. You can split this bonus between any two d20 rolls made over the duration of the feat that you used to meditate, adding +1 to each d20 roll, or using the full bonus on any one d20 roll, adding +2 to that single roll.
