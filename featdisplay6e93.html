You can use a spell-like ability at a greater range.

Prerequisites: Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.

Benefit: Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a reach spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).

When you use a reach spell-like ability, it can alter a spell-like ability with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. You can select a spell-like ability that duplicates a spell only if its level is less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 1 per increase in range category. For example, a spell-like ability with a range of touch can be increased to long range only if it duplicates a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 3. For a summary, see Table 3-3. Reach spell-like abilities that normally require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.

Spell-like abilities that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.

Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.
