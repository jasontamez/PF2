Description

These fine, gray ashes usually come in a black leather bag covered in various symbols of bad luck. When the contents of the bag are flung into the air, the ashes coat creatures within a 10-foot radius of the user, causing them to take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for 2d4 rounds. The user is immune to this effect.
