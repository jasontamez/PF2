These are the most common tactics PCs will likely employ when executing heists. Each one has a general description, but also lists the skills commonly used as a part of that tactic. Not every attempt at one of these tactics will use those skills, and in many cases, you can simply adjudicate success or failure without a roll if a character does exactly the right thing or exactly the wrong one.

Bribery: Sometimes it's easier to appeal to an opponent's greed than it is to trick or overpower him. The two key elements of this kind of task are persuasion and the currency to back it up. A team planning a heist might bribe a guard to look the other way during a break-in, a master architect to reveal where the secret sally port is, a powerful wizard to craft a scroll of <a href="spelldisplay32e1-2.html?ItemName=nondetection">nondetection</a> with no questions asked, or even a random stranger who happens upon a heist mid-execution to keep quiet. Bribing semi-intelligent creatures (such as a dog with fresh meat, or some kind of guardian creature with a few flashy but cheap objects) counts as the bribery tactic as well. To determine the value that will make an effective bribe for an intelligent creature, use that creature's CR (or the group's total CR) as the Heroic Level value on <a href="rulesd93e.html?Name=Step%206:%20Gear&amp;Category=Creating%20NPCs">Table 14-9: NPC Gear</a>. Use the total gp value as a basis. An appropriate bribe can range from 5% for a minor favor (like taking the briber to the guard captain) to 10% for a larger one (like revealing a secret) to 25% or more for simply letting the PCs pass and looking the other way, risking their jobs and reputations if their employer discovers this treachery. A PC usually determines an appropriate bribe using Appraise or Sense Motive, and might need to use Diplomacy (or, rarely, Intimidate) to convince the target to take the bribe.

Disguise and Impersonation: When a PC needs to make an obstacle think she's someone else, it falls under the category of disguise and impersonation. Some team members use makeup, prosthetics, and guile, while others rely on magic. Disguise and Bluff are the crucial elements of disguise and impersonation, though Linguistics might help imitate speech patterns and Knowledge or Profession skills might be required to simulate a specific person's abilities. <a href="spelldisplaydd29.html?ItemName=Disguise%20self">Disguise self</a>, <a href="spelldisplaya256.html?ItemName=polymorph">polymorph</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayca2e.html?ItemName=seeming">seeming</a> spells can improve a PC's disguise. Spells like <a href="spelldisplaybd0b.html?ItemName=mind%20blank">mind blank</a>, <a href="spelldisplay32e1-2.html?ItemName=nondetection">nondetection</a>, and <a href="spelldisplayefea.html?ItemName=undetectable%20alignment">undetectable alignment</a> offer partial protection against some divination spells, but can tip off a nearby caster that a disguised PC isn't who she seems.

Dispelling and Countermagic: This very specific task requires a spellcaster or someone with the ability to use certain magical devices. Any sort of defense that includes divinations, passive alarms, and protective spells might require a magical solution. Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft are important for the process of dispelling or using countermagic, as they help to ascertain what sorts of spells are active and what the appropriate countermeasures might be.

Diversion: A diversion can draw someone or something away from another critical feature of the defenses. A diversion might be needed to distract a single individual, a small group of people, or an entire community, and becomes more difficult the greater the scale. Diversions might consist of actual skirmishes between opposing groups (a rival group of thieves and the local watch patrol), brilliant displays of magic, or outrageous flirting (this is particularly valuable at court). Though Bluff is the most common skill used in diversions, Perform and Intimidate can also help draw attention, and many diversions require little skill at all. Spells useful for creating diversions include <a href="spelldisplay2d50.html?ItemName=dancing%20lights">dancing lights</a>, flashy attack evocations, illusions (especially figments and patterns), and summoning spells.

Finesse: Activities that require physical skill (and typically high Dexterity) fall under finesse. This includes acrobatic stunts, picking locks, and so forth. Acrobatics and Disable Device help with finesse. A spellcaster who's weak at finesse can still attempt to overcome locks with the <a href="spelldisplay85a6.html?ItemName=knock">knock</a> spell.

Force: This kind of task is the easiest to complete, because most characters are very good at overcoming enemies with violence. This obviously focuses on combat, but other elements of force can include carrying a large piece of equipment, hoisting the gate blocking ingress to the castle, or smashing in a door.

Observation: In most heists, there is usually a call for at least one member to hang back and keep a watch on things for the rest of the group. This might include looking out for approaching guards, using scrying magic to observe where a specific individual is or whether a room is truly empty, or simply keeping different teams on task and their actions coordinated. The observer might also take on the role of a backup to other tasks or a means of rescue if things go off track. Perception is the most commonly used skill for observation, though assessing the necessary information acquired through observation requires Sense Motive, an appropriate Knowledge skill, Spellcraft, or a Profession skill related to the people being observed.

Persuasion: Attempting to use social skills such as Diplomacy or Intimidate can be an uphill battle against suspicious guards, as the guards' job depends on keeping the wrong people out. Enchantment spells and spells like <a href="spelldisplay8a68.html?ItemName=innocence">innocence</a> or <a href="spelldisplay1d6e.html?ItemName=glibness">glibness</a> can help a PC overcome this natural wariness.

Smuggling: The complexity of smuggling can have an enormous range. It could be as simple as slipping a weapon inside a well-guarded parlay chamber or as complex as getting an entire team of acrobats past the duke's throne room unnoticed and unharmed. Smuggling falls under Sleight of Hand, but Bluff or Disguise might be useful to maintain a facade while smuggling something or someone valuable.

Stealth and Subterfuge: Though sneaking past enemies and wards is a major part of stealth and subterfuge, this category also includes other tasks that require discretion. Example tasks include scaling a wall and slipping through a window, surreptitiously adding a sleeping potion to a courtier's drink, lifting the prison key off the captain of the guard, and sneaking through the sleeping quarters of the guards. Stealth and Sleight of Hand are the main skills used in such situations. Spells like <a href="spelldisplay749c.html?ItemName=invisibility">invisibility</a>, <a href="spelldisplay672f.html?ItemName=silence">silence</a>, polymorph spells, and <a href="spelldisplay47a2.html?ItemName=darkness">darkness</a> (if used carefully) make a PC much stealthier.

Diversions

Diversions are well suited to characters who aren't stealthy themselves and are attempting to aid their sneakier allies. Here are a few specific types of diversions.

Double Bluff: This ploy is useful when multiple subgroups of the party attempt to sneak into a place. Less stealthy members go in together, so that if they get caught they can instead create a diversion to help their stealthier allies. This trick can backfire if the guards react by raising the alarm.

Harrying: If the enemy has a defensive position or superior numbers, some of the PCs can attack them anyway, not to defeat them, but to draw their attention. The skirmish must be credible enough to draw attention, but not so much that the enemy retaliates en masse.

Puppet Brawl: In an urban setting, some of the PCs can start a brawl with random locals or each other in order to draw guards away from their post.

Razzle-Dazzle: The most common way to use social skills for a diversion, the razzle-dazzle entices guards to engage in an interesting conversation or engaging performance and shirk their duties. Group Stealth and Disguise Sneaking around and using disguises can be difficult when operating as a group. Though one person might be highly skilled and specialized, it's often the party member with the worst Stealth or weakest disguise who causes the whole group to get caught. Though the most effective tactic is to assign those characters to different tasks, that's not always possible. Here are a few ways to help mitigate this risk.

Unseen Numbers

More people require more or larger places to conceal themselves, and even then the group is only as stealthy as its clumsiest member. Using aid another on an ally's Stealth check is often infeasible. It's useful when attempting to sneak as a group to have the stealthier or more perceptive characters move ahead of the rest of the party. The job of the forward characters is to spot guards or traps before the rest of the party can stumble into them. Once warned of the danger, other party members can either change their route or use their own talents to handle the situation. Characters farther back are harder to perceive because of distance and possibly doors or walls.

Characters with the teamwork feat <a href="featdisplay65eb.html?ItemName=Stealth%20Synergy">Stealth Synergy</a> can use the highest Stealth check roll among them (though they still use their own skill modifiers). A few archetypes have abilities to boost their allies' Stealth checks, including the <a href="archetypedisplaybefb.html?FixedName=Swashbuckler%20Daring%20Infiltrator">daring infiltrator swashbuckler</a>, the <a href="archetypedisplaye032.html?FixedName=Ranger%20Guide">guide ranger</a>, and the <a href="archetypedisplay6e35.html?FixedName=Ranger%20Warden">warden ranger</a>.

Armored Subterfuge

Medium and heavy armor are vital to the survival of many characters, yet often counterproductive when sneaking past guards or disguising oneself. Though lighter armor is always an option, there are a number of ways to reduce the penalties associated with heavier armor. Masterwork armor and those made from special materials such as mithral have lower armor check penalties. A number of magic armor special abilities improve skills normally penalized by armor, including <a href="magicarmordisplay4ef4.html?ItemName=Creeping">creeping</a> (Ultimate Equipment 116), <a href="magicarmordisplay372c.html?ItemName=Shadow">shadow</a>, and <a href="magicarmordisplay4bf1.html?ItemName=Slick">slick</a>. The <a href="magicarmordisplay8e76.html?ItemName=Glamered">glamered</a> armor special ability allows even a heavily armored character to blend into a crowd. Any armor's penalty can be reduced with the <a href="traitdisplay4978.html?ItemName=Armor%20Expert">Armor Expert</a> trait or the <a href="classdisplay3651.html?ItemName=Fighter">fighter's armor training</a> ability. Applying <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay5726.html?ItemName=Armor%20ointment">armor ointment</a> or casting <a href="spelldisplay00d4.html?ItemName=effortless%20armor">effortless armor</a> also reduces armor check penalty.

Group Disguises

Disguise has an advantage over stealth, as sometimes not everyone in the party needs to be disguised for a plan to work. For instance, one or more characters might disguise themselves as bounty hunters or guards bringing in the others in chains. <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay8d6f.html?ItemName=Breakaway%20chains">Breakaway chains</a> and <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay0363.html?ItemName=False%20manacles">false manacles</a> allow PCs to appear chained while able to easily free themselves. Even a good disguise fails, however, if the character can't play the assumed persona convincingly. The best disguises are often as people unlikely to be questioned or engaged in conversation'servants, laborers, and guards. A brazen infiltrator might pretend to be someone in authority, such as a foreign noble or a military officer, relying on aloofness or brusqueness to avoid questions. For a group, one character can be disguised as an authority figure while the rest play her servants. This provides a built-in excuse for party members to defer to the PC with the best social skills.
