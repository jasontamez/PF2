Tactics

Before Combat Well in advance of battle, the fighter activates her bronze griffon and saddles and armors it. Before the fighting starts, she mounts her griffon, takes to the air, and quaffs her potion of heroism.
During Combat The fighter flies above the battlefield taking passes with her lance, never flying lower than 10 feet above the ground. If outmatched in melee, she retreats to higher altitude and uses her bow. A griffon rider loves to unseat other mounted combatants, particularly if they're flying. She keeps a plentiful supply of alchemist's fire in case any flammable targets present themselves.

Griffon riders patrol the skies around remote elven enclaves. Rare individuals serve powerful spellcasters or serve as mercenary shock troops.

Jalynel Masathal

Always something of an outcast among other elves, Jalynel felt closer to her loyal griffon mount than to any of her fellow elven knights. When her mount perished in battle against a flock of perytons, Jalynel was devastated. Once she recovered from her own wounds, she deserted her unit and indentured herself to a powerful wizard. In exchange, he crafted for her a bronze figurine in the very image of her beloved griffon. Twice per week, she can place it on the ground and bring it life. Jalynel believes her companion's soul dwells within the figurine's cold bronze. She rests easy knowing a lethal wound now only turns her mount back to bronze, to be brought to life again another day.

Jalynel spends most of her time following orders from her wizard master. During her rare breaks from his service, she hires out as a scout and aerial cavalry. On occasion, she throws in with adventuring bands in hopes of finding good treasure that will appeal to her wizard master and allow her to pay off her debt quickly.

Combat Encounters: Jalynel is usually found protecting the domain of her wizard master, or amid an group of adventurers seeking magical treasure. She avoids traveling into dungeons or caverns if possible, preferring to be in open spaces where she can activate her figurine of wondrous power and fight from the air.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Jalynel approaches adventurers to form a group to go after valuable treasures, particularly those with magical substances or items she can return to her master.
