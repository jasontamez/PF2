Description

Each application of this alchemical solution, typically compounded from substances found in desert flowers, fruits, and roots, heals 1d4 points of nonlethal damage that the target has taken from heat exposure. If you succeed at a DC 20 Heal check while applying sun cream, you may add your Wisdom modifier to the nonlethal damage healed. A creature cannot benefit from more than one application of sun cream in a 24-hour period.
