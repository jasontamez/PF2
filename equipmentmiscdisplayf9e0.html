Description

Non-halflings do not receive any bonus from this drink. This mild sedative is normally used to treat insomnia, making the drinker reluctant to take hasty actions but adept at remaining still or silent. One cup of the tonic gives a halfling a -4 penalty on initiative checks for 10 minutes and a +2 alchemical bonus on Stealth checks for that time.
