The creature is restored to full hit points after 8 hours of rest so long as it isn't dead. In addition, by expending one use of mythic power and resting for 1 hour, it regains a number of hit points equal to half its full hit points (up to a maximum of its full hit points) and regain the use of any class features that are limited to a certain number of uses per day (such as barbarian rage, bardic performance, spells per day, and so on). This rest is treated as 8 hours of sleep for such abilities. This rest doesn't refresh uses of mythic power or any mythic abilities that are limited to a number of times per day.
