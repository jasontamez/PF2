Boon A guard officer can alert the PCs to local customs, traditions, tricks, and suspicious activity, granting a +2 bonus for 24 hours on opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks within the city. She can also arrange a meeting with a watch captain for the PCs.

Guard officers supervise guards in their duties and respond to major disturbances, using their grim demeanors and skill at arms to quell conf lict. They coordinate well in battle with the guards under their command, rounding up troublemakers and preventing their escape.

Guard officers can also be used as highly skilled gladiators or flamboyant bounty hunters. They might even be found as royal guardsmen in a king's throne room. In an evil society, guard officers may wear spiked armor and be outfitted with scythes or spiked chains instead of guisarmes and poisoned hand crossbows instead of nets.

Guard officers usually patrol with four guards (CR 6), or three guard officers may serve as adjutants to a watch captain (CR 8). Two guard officers can escort a battle mage (CR 7) to respond to magical threats. Four guard officers and a champion (CR 10) form an elite arena fighting team, while two guard officers and two slavers (CR 7) might guard a valuable shipment of slaves.
