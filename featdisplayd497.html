Your faerie fire not only illuminates your foes, but it also shows you their weaknesses.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplaydf1d.html?ItemName=Nightmare%20Fist">Nightmare Fist</a>, <a href="featdisplayb205.html?ItemName=Nightmare%20Weaver">Nightmare Weaver</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist</a>, Heal 5 ranks, ability to cast faerie fire.

Benefit:  While a faerie fire you have cast (not one cast from a spell completion or spell trigger item) outlines an opponent, the DC for that opponent to resist your Stunning Fist attempts increases by +2. If you hit an opponent with a Stunning Fist attempt, and that opponent fails her saving throw, you can render the target shaken for 1d2 rounds plus 1 round for every 5 by which the opponent failed her save.

When you hit an opponent with a Stunning Fist attack and that opponent fails its saving throw, you can spend 5 stamina points to make the opponent frightened for 1d4 rounds instead of shaken.
