Description

This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. A bead
of force can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties.
Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that
deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot
radius.


Once thrown, a bead of force functions like a resilient sphere
spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a
duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses
the targeted creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit
within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject
for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of
any sort except from a rod of cancellation, a rod of negation,
disintegrate, or a targeted dispel magic spell. These effects
destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass
through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe
normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be
physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles
of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead,
making this a one-use item.
