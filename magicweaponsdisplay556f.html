Description

As a standard action, the wielder of a liberating weapon can free herself or an adjacent creature from spells and abilities that inhibit movement, such as paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web. The wielder attempts a combat maneuver check while holding the weapon (DC = 15 + either the spell's caster level or the creature's HD); success dispels the effect. Only a single attempt can be made against each spell or effect.
