Special Abilities

Alert (Su) An iron sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it has the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it's keyed. When an iron sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard within 500 feet. Alternatively, an iron sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep but doesn't affect normal concentration. An iron sentinel's creator is the first creature it is keyed to, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp.

Head-Butt (Ex) Once every 3 rounds, if an iron sentinel hits the same creature with both claw attacks, it can also attempt to head-butt that creature. If this attack is successful, in addition to the damage, the target is staggered for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 14 Fortitude save. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Icy Bolt (Su) As a standard action, an iron sentinel can fire a bolt of ice as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. This bolt deals 1d6 points of cold damage. The target is also slowed (as per the spell <a href="spelldisplay222a.html?ItemName=slow">slow</a>) for 1d6+1 rounds (a DC 14 Fortitude save negates this slow effect). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Immunity to Magic (Ex) An iron sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, except for spells with the electricity descriptor.

Description

Popular in the more brutish Thassilonian lands of Bakrakhan, Gastash, and Haruka, iron sentinels were commonly employed in large platoons to repel organized, armed assaults. They most often begin combat with an icy bolt intended to slow advancing hostiles, who are then easier targets for the constructs' physical attacks.

Construction

Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same, regardless of the specific type of sentinel being created. (The statue atop which the sentinel often perches is not a part of its total cost). Each sentinel must be carved or worked in fine detail before being subjected to spells and magical unguents worth 1,000 gp.

During the height of the Thassilonian Empire, nobles and other wealthy elite favored these constructs as guardians and protectors in their homes, hidden in plain sight among the palace's normal decorations. Able to replace the heads of statues to blend in, these creatures keep alert for intruders and extract themselves from the statues with which they are docked in order to attack. The creatures don't need to remove themselves from their statues to use their special attacks, however, and only separate for added mobility or to have the chance to attack with their claws.

At least a dozen varieties of sentinel pervaded long-vanished Thassilon. All of these varieties were crafted from materials that wouldn't be out of place as a medium for sculpting or casting. Though the practice of creating these constructs largely died out along with the empire at Earthfall, explorers delving into forgotten ruins sometimes encounter sentinels that still function.
