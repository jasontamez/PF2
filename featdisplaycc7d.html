You are experienced at long-term intimidation of those you wish to exploit, and strike fear into the hearts of those you bully.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay5136.html?ItemName=Intimidating%20Prowess">Intimidating Prowess</a>, member of the Lumber Consortium.

Benefit:  When you use the Intimidate skill to improve a target's attitude, if your check result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, the target's attitude is improved for 5d6 hours. During this time, should it attack you, the target immediately becomes shaken for 1d6+1 rounds, as though it had been demoralized.
