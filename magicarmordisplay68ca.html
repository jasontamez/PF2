Description

Crafted from the skin of a great cat, this +1 hide armor provides its wearer a +2 competence bonus on all ability checks to perform feats of strength, such as bending bars, and forcing doors. This bonus doesn't apply on any other Strength-related rolls (including Strength-based skill checks and melee attack and damage rolls). The wearer also treats her Strength score as if it were 8 higher than normal for the purpose of determining her carrying capacity.
