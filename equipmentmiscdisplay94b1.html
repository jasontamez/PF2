Description

This small firework burns brightly and makes a loud, eerie whistling sound. It can be thrown to target an intersection as a splash weapon. Any creatures within 5 feet of the noise are effectively deafened while they remain in the area, as even the loudest sounds they make are drowned out by the piercing sound. A banshee ballerina firework burns for 1d4+1 rounds before extinguishing itself with a quiet puff of smoke. Crafting this item is a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check.
