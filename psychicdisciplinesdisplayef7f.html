You attract the attention of spirits as naturally as a lodestone attracts iron filings. Testing your power leads you to develop some control over undead forces, despite the inherent defenses such creatures have against psychic abilities. Meanwhile, those spirits clinging to your life essence become increasingly protective, channeling their abilities to aid you and warn of threats. Psychics of this discipline are most common in Ustalav and Shenmen, where so many spirits are stuck in the transition between life and death.

Discipline Powers: Your powers interact with the spiritual world, attracting the attention of minor spirits and undead.


Lingering Spirits (Sp): Numerous minor spirits find themselves attracted to you. Your connection with these spirits allows you to manifest any of the following spell-like abilities as a swift action: mage hand, ghost sound, grave words, or telekinetic projectile. You can use this  ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Spiritual Bulwark (Su): At 5th level, you develop a deeper attachment to your lingering spirits, and learn to rely on their presence as protection from external spiritual attacks. You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on saving throws against effects generated by haunts, incorporeal undead, incorporeal outsiders, and on saving throws against possession attempts.


Phantasmal Assault (Su): At 13th level, you learn to harness your psychic force against all forms of haunts and undead creatures. Your mind-affecting spells that deal damage can now be used against haunts and undead normally immune to mind-affecting effects (including mindless undead). These spells are treated as though they dealt positive energy damage. This affects only spells that deal purely psychic-based damage (such as psychic crush, mind thrust, or synapse overload); effects based on physical effects (such as telekinetic projectile or telekinetic storm) don't benefit from this ability. Additional non-damaging effects from such spells don't affect the haunt, unless it would be normally affected. When you use a mind-affecting effect that deals damage against a possessed creature, the possessing entity takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the mind-affecting attack.
