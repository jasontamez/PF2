The Gray Maidens are more than just soldiers-they drill relentlessly to fight as a team and to protect their bodies and minds. A Gray Maiden using the Sisterhood Style can easily coordinate tactics with other women.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (longsword)</a>, base attack bonus +2.

Benefit: While using this style and wielding a longsword and a light or heavy shield, you gain a +1 bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws. In addition, when you enter the Sisterhood Style stance, you can choose a teamwork feat you have. As a swift action, you can grant that feat to an ally within 10 feet until the beginning of your next turn.
