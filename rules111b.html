These tactics apply to individual characters, and each character decides whether she's using the tactic.

Fast Track: A character using this tactic does not reduce her progress by half while tracking. However, she takes a -5 penalty on the Survival check to track. Abilities such as the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger's master hunter class feature</a> negate this penalty.

Obscure Trail: Mark the terrain tile where a character starts and stops using this tactic. A character using this tactic reduces her progress by half in order to increase the DC to track her group by 5 throughout the marked section. This tactic requires the group to be quarries.

Recovery: A character can spend a phase tending to the health of her or her allies. This allows the character to cast healing spells, for example, which can be useful for removing nonlethal damage if the group has been hustling or making a forced march (see <%RULESGroup Tactics&Category=Pursuit Tactics">group tactics</a>). A character that spends a phase helping with recovery can't attempt to track or gain an advantage in that phase.

Special Movement: A character with consistent access to a fly speed, swim speed, or the like for a full pursuit phase might be able to move particularly quickly over the appropriate type of terrain; though, for instance, a character flying above a jungle canopy would not be able to follow a trail below.
