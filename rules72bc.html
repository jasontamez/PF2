Some planes have a predisposition toward a certain alignment. Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral (good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic) components; a plane with alignment traits can have a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each. Second, the specific alignment trait indicates whether each moral or ethical component is mildly or strongly evident. Many planes have no alignment traits; these traits are noted in a plane's description only when they are present.

No plane can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned, nor can any plane be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned.



Mildly Aligned

Creatures who have an alignment opposite that of a mildly aligned plane take a -2 penalty on all Charisma-based checks. A mildly neutral-aligned plane applies no penalties.



Strongly Aligned

On strongly aligned planes, a -2 penalty applies on the Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks of all creatures not of the plane's alignment. The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait stack.

A strongly neutral-aligned plane stands in opposition to or in careful balance between all moral and ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos. Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments than with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes impose a -2 penalty on the Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks of any creature that isn't neutral. The penalty is applied separately for neutrality with respect to law and chaos and for neutrality with respect to good and evil; therefore chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures take a -2 penalty, and chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good creatures take a -4 penalty.
