Description

Snowborn frequently fight off hostile enemies of both the intelligent and animalistic varieties. The smart half-elf knows that he can't lose a fight that never begins and makes every attempt to stave off combat. This white fur stole helps the wary snowborn, or anyone else, temporarily calm down opponents. While wearing this stole, the wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks to improve someone's attitude and on wild empathy checks to improve an animal's attitude. Three times per day on command, the wearer can activate the stole to gain a 20-foot radius aura of either <a href="spelldisplay2068.html?ItemName=calm%20animals">calm animals </a> or <a href="spelldisplay6e9f.html?ItemName=calm%20emotions">calm emotions</a> for 1 minute (Will DC 13 negates). The stole also functions as cold weather clothing.
