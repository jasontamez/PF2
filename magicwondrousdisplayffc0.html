Description

The thick glass lens of this golden-framed monocle is
attached to the wearer by a weighty chain. This monocle
helps draw out the truth of things, and was originally created
to aid in the investigation of crimes and the questioning of
witnesses. Twice per day on command, it can create a zone
of truth, as per the spell. In addition, this monocle grants
its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks.
Though it fits over only one of the wearer's eyes, the item
takes up the entire eyes slot.
