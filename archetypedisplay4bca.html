Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 79</a>
Many barbarian tribes are masters of the horse, teaching their members how to ride from a young age. As a result, barbarians from such tribes are even more terrifying when mounted, using their steeds' speed and strength to great advantage. A mounted fury has the following class features.

Fast Rider (Ex):  The speed of any mount the barbarian rides is increased by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.

Bestial Mount (Ex):  At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as a <a href="classdisplay4c10.html?ItemName=Companion">druid's animal companion</a>, using the barbarian's level -4 as her effective druid level. This companion must be one that she is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium barbarian can select a camel or a horse. A Small barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 8th level. Whenever a barbarian is raging while mounted on her bestial mount, the mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.

Rage Powers:  The following rage powers complement the mounted fury archetype: ferocious mount, ferocious trample, greater ferocious mount, greater ferocious trample, and spirit steed.
