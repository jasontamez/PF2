You have a steady hand in any weather.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance.</a>

Benefit:  In areas of strong or severe wind (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439) or when affected by wind effects or spells that penalize ranged attacks, you take only half the ranged attack penalty. You can make ranged attacks in windstorm-level winds at a -4 penalty.

Normal:  Strong and severe winds impose -2 and -4 penalties on ranged attack rolls, respectively. Making ranged attacks in windstorms is impossible.
