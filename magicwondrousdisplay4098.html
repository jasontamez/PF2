Description

This device is just under an inch across
and can be made of ivory, bone, or any
hard mineral. Typically, each of the cube's
faces are polished smooth, but sometimes
they are etched with runes. The device
enables its possessor to put up a special
cube made up of 6 individual wall of force spells, 10 feet on a side
around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and
is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below.
The cube has 36 charges when fully charged-charges used are
automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of
the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the
device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain
for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also,
when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the
maximum value given on the following table.


When the cube of force is active, attacks dealing more than 30
points of damage to a wall drain 1 charge for every 10 points of
damage beyond 30 that they deal. The charge cost to maintain
each of the cube's six walls is summarized below.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Cube Face</td><td>Charge Cost Per Minute</td><td>Max. Speed</td><td>Effect</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>30 ft.</td><td>Keeps out gases, wind, etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>20 ft.</td><td>Keeps out nonliving matter</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>15 ft.</td><td>Keeps out living matter</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>Keeps out magic</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>10 ft.</td><td>Keeps out all things</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>As normal</td><td>Deactivates</td></tr></table>
Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also drain extra
charges. These spells cannot be cast into or out of the cube.
