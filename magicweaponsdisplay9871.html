Description

This +1 sling bullet is slightly smaller than an average steel
bullet, but incredibly dense. It's usually used by kobolds to shrink
down foes or prey, weakening them and making them more
vulnerable to combat maneuvers. The target must succeed at a
DC 11 Fortitude save or decrease in size by one size category for
1d4 rounds, as the spell reduce person.
