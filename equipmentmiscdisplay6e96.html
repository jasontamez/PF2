Description

This leather packet contains tools and materials for repairing items created with one specific Craft skill. Using a mending kit grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft checks made to repair a damaged item of the appropriate type. By spending 1 hour, the user can make a Craft check, dividing the result by 10 to determine how many points of damage are repaired. A mending kit can be used 10 times before needing replacement.
