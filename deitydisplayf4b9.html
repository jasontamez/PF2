1: Motley Magic (Sp) color spray 3/day, hypnotic pattern 2/day, or deep slumber 1/day
2: Prismatic Body (Su) You gain a +4 sacred bonus on saves against effects that would blind you. In addition, whenever you make a successful saving throw against a spell or effect with the light descriptor (such as sunbeam), you can choose to ignore the effect entirely and redirect its path toward two different creatures or spaces within 30 feet of you. The designated creatures or spaces are affected as though they were caught in the effect's area or were targeted by the effect.
3: Rainbow Orb (Sp) You can cast prismatic sphere once per day.
