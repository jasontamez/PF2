Description

A rare breed of wasp produces the honey used to make this spiced, mead-like drink. For 1 hour after consuming a glass of wasp metheglin (this takes 1 round), the drinker is quick to respond to harm, gaining a +1 alchemical bonus on attack rolls against any creature that has damaged her with an attack within the previous round. This bonus does not stack with itself. A typical bottle holds four glasses' worth of metheglin.
