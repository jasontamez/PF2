Published adventures can be a great investment. Reading through such a scenario can give you an idea of how an adventure is put together, what challenges are suitable for your group's power level, and what sorts of rewards are appropriate. The Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook deals with these subjects, but there's nothing like seeing all the elements put together. More importantly, a close look at adventures someone else has thought through can give you new ideas for constructing your own. It's easy to fall into a rut, especially when you're running games regularly, and adventures like Paizo's Pathfinder Adventure Paths and Pathfinder Modules can help dig you out.

Similarly, there's a wealth of prepackaged campaign settings available, including Paizo's own Pathfinder Campaign Setting. Consider mining concepts from them for your own world, or adopting locations from them that inspire adventure concepts.

No matter how many published adventures or settings you own, it's up to you to decide whether you'll use them. If you merely lift an idea from them now and then, you're still getting your money's worth, but using them to a greater extent allows GMs to run sweeping, intricate campaigns with minimal preparation.
