Description

Much like <a href="magicwondrousdisplay10e5.html?FinalName=Wayfinder">wayfinders</a>, an ioun gauntlet grants enhanced or altogether new abilities depending on the type of <a href="magicwondrous8768.html?FinalSlot=Ioun">ioun stone</a> inserted into its matrix. In its base form, an ioun gauntlet grants its wearer the ability to cast <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> as a spell-like ability once per day. When the <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> effect is active, the gauntlet also sheds illumination as <a href="spelldisplay9f2d.html?ItemName=light">light</a> in the 60- foot cone of the <a href="spelldisplayba02.html?ItemName=detect%20magic">detect magic</a> effect.

An ioun gauntlet features a single matrix in the back of the hand, suitable for one ioun stone. When an ioun stone is inserted into the matrix as a standard action, the wearer gains the associated bonus from the ioun stone as well an additional effect based on the shape of the ioun stone inserted, as listed below. While a creature can put on two ioun gauntlets, the wearer gains the additional benefit from only one inserted ioun stone.

Cabochon: +1 enhancement bonus on Acrobatics checks.

Disk: +1 enhancement bonus on Linguistics checks.

Ellipsoid: +1 enhancement bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks.

Nodule: +1 enhancement bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks.
