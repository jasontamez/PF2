Description

This +3 impact warhammer deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage when it hits. As a swift action, the wielder can will the hammer's crystalline head to grow jagged spikes, switching its damage type to piercing for a single blow. When the bearer confirms a critical hit with the hammer of seismic assault, a concussive blast emits from the hammer in a 10-foot-radius spread, causing a tremor to rip through the ground. Any creatures standing on the ground in this area with a CMD equal to or lower than the result of the confirmation roll are knocked prone. This damaged area is considered rough terrain for 10 minutes.
