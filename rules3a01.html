An NPC should typically have only one affiliation (if any), and the GM gets to decide what that affiliation is. Yet there is no maximum number of affiliations for NPCs-an NPC can have as many as are needed for the GM to tell the story she wishes to tell. It's generally unnecessary to list in an NPC's statistics what affiliations he has, since that should be clear from the NPC's background.
