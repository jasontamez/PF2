The trickster mage thinks everyone deserves to be the butt of his jokes, even if they don't want to be.

Qualzar Jallarimple

Qualzar's heritage includes mischievous fey who tie shoelaces, curdle milk, and generally make nuisances of themselves. He claims to not understand why other creatures find his humor malicious, but in truth he doesn't care. He's willing to hurt others for the sake of a pun or punch line, and has a book of plucked fairy wings to prove it.

Combat Encounters: Qualzar may try to annoy the PCs in a city or woodland, either for spite or as part of some elaborate, cruel joke. If one of his victims is injured in a funny way, he laughs even harder. His actions could be incidental to another encounter-he might appear just long enough to make trouble during a fight, then leave and not be seen again for weeks.

Roleplaying Encounters: Qualzar could lead a troupe of gnomes or be a recent outcast from a famous circle of allies. He might make catcalls at PCs to undermine their diplomatic efforts, or arrange to humiliate them at a time when they can't retaliate.
