Description

Each time this jar gains a new user it produces 2d4 dragon
teeth. When one of these teeth is swallowed, it grants the user
the following powers for 1 full week or until it is dismissed as
a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
<ul><li>The user is immediately polymorphed into a dragon, as if
subject to form of the dragon I, II, or III, depending on the
user’s Hit Dice. If the creature swallowing the tooth has 12
HD or fewer, it is affected as per form of the dragon I. Those with 13 to 18 HD are affected as per form of the dragon II,
and those 19 or more Hit Dice are affected as per form of the
dragon III. The type of dragon is chosen by the user based on
its alignment.
Lawful good: bronze dragon, gold dragon, or silver dragon
Neutral good: any metallic dragon
Chaotic good: brass dragon or copper dragon
Lawful neutral: any chromatic or metallic dragon
Neutral: any chromatic or metallic dragon

The user’s draconic appearance is always the same each
subsequent time it swallows a tooth. While in draconic form,
the user gains the following benefits.

The jar never creates dragon teeth for the same creature more
than once. If the owner changes before all the teeth created
by the jar are consumed, the original owner no longer gains
benefit from this artifact.

Destruction

If simultaneously hit with the breath weapon attacks of all the
chromatic and metallic dragon types, the Jar of Dragon Teeth
is destroyed within that convergence.
