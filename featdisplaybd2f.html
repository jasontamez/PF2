Your powerful blows can knock down your opponents.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay70ef.html?ItemName=Bludgeoner">Bludgeoner</a>, <a href="featdisplayd6b3.html?ItemName=Cudgeler%20Style">Cudgeler Style</a>, base attack bonus +5 or monk level 5th.

Benefit:  When you hit with a charge attack using the Cudgeler Style feat, you can immediately attempt a single trip combat maneuver check against the target with a +2 competence bonus as a free action. This provokes an attack of opportunity as normal for a trip combat maneuver.
