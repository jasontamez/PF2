Description

This lacquered wooden tube is designed to protect a wand during transportation. When held in an off hand, the wielder can safely cast spells from her wand without chance of incurring a primal magic event (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 13). A wand protector can be used only in conjunction with wands casting spells that require a standard action or shorter. Once the wand protector has prevented 10 primal magic events, it crumbles into dust.
