Description

Though largely constructed in the image of Deskari's own terrible scythe, Riftcarver, these +3 scythes bear tiny cracks and etchings that, upon close examination, make the weapons appear like they're constructed of minute petrified maggots. Once per day, upon scoring a successful critical hit with a Rotcarver, the wielder can animate part of the blade as a rot grub that immediately attempts to burrow into to the victim struck. The victim must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid the grub; otherwise, it is affected as per the description of rot grubs on page 245 of the GameMastery Guide. Additionally, once per week, the Rotcarver's wielder can transform it into a swarm of rot grubs (see page 215 of Bestiary 3). The swarm obeys the wielder's commands for 13 rounds before turning back into a weapon. If the swarm is destroyed, it immediately reverts back to a weapon, which is undamaged. The wielder takes no ill effects from a swarm under his control.
