Not only are you skilled at binding your opponent's weapon, you can seize the advantage while he struggles to retrieve his blade.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +4, proficiency with khopesh or temple sword.

Benefit: You receive a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to bind an opponent's weapon, as well as any opposed rolls to maintain the bind. This bonus stacks with the +2 bonus from wielding a khopesh or temple sword. If you succeed in blade binding your opponent, your opponent becomes flat-footed until he either wrestles his blade free or drops his weapon.

Special: A monk may select Blade Binder as his 6th-level monk bonus feat.

Note: New Attack Option: Bind: As a melee attack, you may attempt to gain control of your opponent's weapon. Make an opposed attack roll against your opponent, including all appropriate modifiers. If you succeed, you bind your opponent's weapon.

A bound weapon cannot be used to make attacks, nor does it allow its wielder to threaten any space. A bound weapon can be wrenched free with a successful opposed attack roll, or can be dropped as a free action. If your opponent does not free or drop his weapon he cannot move beyond your reach.

While binding your opponent, you suffer the same limitations, except you may end the bind as a free action. If you attempt to disarm your opponent or sunder the bound weapon, you do not provoke an attack of opportunity, and you get a +4 bonus on the opposed roll and the damage roll of the sunder attempt.
