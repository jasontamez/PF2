Description

This hard ceramic sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier, much like a <a href="equipmentmiscdisplay132c.html?ItemName=Smoke%20pellet">smoke pellet<%END in larger form, usable by cannons and fiend's mouth cannons. When it hits the targeting space, it deals 2d6 points of damage to any creature in that space, and the substances mingle and then create an area of foul but harmless yellow smoke radiating 30 feet from the target square. Treat the effect as a <a href="spelldisplayb85f.html?ItemName=fog%20cloud">fog cloud</a> spell. On a siege engine mishap, the ammunition explodes before it is launched. Its effect is centered on one of the spaces of the siege engine (crew leader's choice).
