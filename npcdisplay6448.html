Cruel instructors teach great knowledge, but in the most belittling manner.

Ormal Ardem

Though bent and frail, Master Ardem intimidates his students and annoys other instructors. He's so entrenched in the university that everyone must pass through at least one of his classes. He never gives second chances, and nitpicks every assignment.

Ardem's skill at language and monologue, as well as his encyclopedic memory, allow him to dumbfound anyone of lesser intelligence and belittle those he considers beneath him. He sees himself a genius able to overcome any obstacle through reason.

Master Ardem doesn't believe anyone should have an easy time. He constantly uses obscure school bylaws to restrict other instructors in their spending and pursuits. He even got the school of divination removed from the curriculum, though he still uses the magic himself.

Though hard-hearted, Ardem shows tenderness to keyboard instruments. His skilled fingers dance across the keys of pianos and harpsichords, producing haunting and delicate pieces. For every person attending his concerts for his music, another has come to witness this cruel man be beautiful for a moment.

Combat Encounters: If forced into combat, Ardem calls students to aid him. He won't tolerate anyone but himself bullying or harassing students and fellow faculty, and comes to their aid with brash confidence.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Ormal belittles the slightest mistakes of speech or manners. If one can get past his condescension, he can be an excellent source of academic information thanks to his years of study and experience.
