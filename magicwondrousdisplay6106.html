Description

Solving this simple kinetic puzzle involves removing several
pegs from a handheld wooden cube. However, removing the
final peg triggers the magical trap. The box explodes in the
victim's hands, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC
14 for half damage). Detecting that the box is trapped requires
a successful DC 30 Perception check made by a character with
the trapfinding ability, and disabling it requires a successful DC
30 Disable Device check.
