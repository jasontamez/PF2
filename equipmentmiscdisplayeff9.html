Description

The rack is one of the most infamous and feared devices in the torturer's arsenal, capable of inflicting ruinous damage to a victim's body. Helpless victims are splayed across the device's frame, and each limb is lashed to a central windlass. Each turn of the crank deals a cumulative 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, up to 4d6 points of nonlethal damage on the fourth turn. Each subsequent turn after the fourth deals 4d6 points of nonlethal damage and deals 1 point of damage each to the victim's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores as it dislocates limbs, cracks cartilage, and breaks bone. Some racks are fitted with spiked wheels that puncture the victim's body, dealing lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage. Escaping from a rack requires a successful DC 30 Escape Artist check.
