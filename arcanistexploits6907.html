Strength Normal
The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir to cast a spell while under the effects of a polymorph spell. This ability works like <a href="featdisplaybba2.html?ItemName=Natural%20Spell">Natural Spell</a>, except the arcanist uses the ability to cast while under the effects of a spell instead of wild shape.
