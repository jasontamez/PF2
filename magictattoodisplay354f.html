Description

This simple tattoo emits a constant haze of odorless, shadowy smoke around the limbs of its bearer that she can animate with a thought, hiding herself behind a screen of smoke. If the tattoo is visible when the bearer is hit by a melee or ranged attack or when the bearer fails a Reflex save, the wearer can activate the tattoo to shroud herself in mist as an immediate action. This imposes a 20% miss chance on attacks made against the bearer. On a failed Reflex save, it grants the ability to reroll the Reflex save and gain a +4 bonus. The bearer can use this ability three times per day.
