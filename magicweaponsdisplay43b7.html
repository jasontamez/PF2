Description

The bone handle of this +1 wounding dagger is engraved with imagery of fierce beasts. Once per day as a standard action, the dagger can be driven into a target's appendage by making a melee attack with a -5 penalty. If this attack hits, the dagger drives itself into the bone of the creature, giving the creature a -2 penalty on attacks, damage rolls, and Reflex saves for 1 minute. The dagger can be removed by the target or another adjacent creature with a successful DC 15 Strength check. The dagger also grants a +4 competence bonus on skill checks attempted in conjunction with the Harvest Parts feat.
