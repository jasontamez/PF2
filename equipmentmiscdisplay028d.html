Description

When applied to a homunculus's skin (which takes 1 minute), this ointment causes the creature's flesh to shift color and pattern reflexively to match its surroundings. The homunculus gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks for 24 hours. The ointment can also be applied to other creatures as long as they are Medium or smaller and wear no clothing or armor to obstruct their skin, but the bonus is reduced to +2.
