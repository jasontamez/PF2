Description

When this <a href="magicwondrous8768.html?FinalSlot=Ioun">ioun stone</a> is embedded in a clockwork construct, it grants the recipient humanlike sentience, as per the <a href="spelldisplay86ed.html?ItemName=awaken%20construct">awaken construct</a> spell. The transformation is not permanent, and regardless of the body a stone is embedded in, the creature in which it's embedded always gains the same alignment, Charisma score increase, Intelligence score, language, memories, personality, and skills. These statistics depend on the ioun memory node type, as noted in the table below.

<table class="inner"><tr><td>Type</td><td>Int</td><td>Cha</td><td>Skills</td><td>Languages</td><td>Max HD</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>7</td><td>+2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>II</td><td>10</td><td>+5</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>III</td><td>12</td><td>+7</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>IV</td><td>15</td><td>+10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>16</td></tr></table>

The skills, languages, and alignment are chosen when the node is created. The node grants a number of skill ranks in those skills equal to the clockwork's Hit Dice. Unlike <a href="spelldisplay86ed.html?ItemName=awaken%20construct">awaken construct</a>, an ioun memory node doesn't grant feats. A clockwork that is already intelligent can access the memories collected in the ioun memory node but is otherwise unaffected. A clockwork whose number of Hit Dice exceeds the maximum HD for that type of ioun memory node is unaffected.
