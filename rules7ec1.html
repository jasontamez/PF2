Altering an array by creature type is a simple process that typically adds or changes some of the monster's statistics. Each creature type includes at least the first two entries.

Automatic Traits: All creatures of this type get these abilities, which typically include senses, immunities, and more detailed sets of traits that are defined in the creature type's full description (Bestiary 306). This doesn't include forms of movement; see Speed in the sidebar on page 195.

Statistics Adjustments: These modifications change the base numbers from the monster's array. These are adjustments, not replacements; increase or decrease the statistics you recorded from the array by the amount indicated. Apply these adjustments to your monster only if it doesn't have a class graft.

Elective Adjustments: These are optional changes that can better evoke the monster's type, frequently including changes to the array's list of skills, monster options typical for this creature type (see <a href="rules09c3.html?Name=Step%207:%20Monster%20Options&amp;Category=Simple%20Monster%20Creation">Step 7</a>), suggested spell lists, or even suggested restrictions. These should point you toward abilities that typically appear among creatures of the listed type, but aren't an exhaustive list of possibilities for monsters of that type.
