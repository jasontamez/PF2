After years spent digging up graves, you are able to move through dirt almost as easily as a fish through water.

Prerequisites: Ghoul.

Benefit:  You gain a burrow speed of 10 feet through earth, sand, or soil.

Special:  You can gain this feat multiple times. Each time you take it, add 10 feet to your burrow speed, up to a maximum of your base land speed.
