This humanoid mountain of stone and earth strides forward on legs like pillars, a vast grove covering its back.

Special Abilities

Earth Glide (Ex) A burrowing earth elemental can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the elemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.
Earth Mastery (Ex) An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks. (These modifiers are not included in the statistics block.)

Special Abilities

Earth Mastery (Ex) A earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a -4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. These modifiers apply to bull rush and overrun maneuvers, whether the elemental is initiating or resisting these kinds of attacks.

Petrify (Su) If it hits a target with a slam attack, a mythic earth elemental can expend two uses of mythic power to permanently turn that target to stone. If the target succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save, it is slowed (as the spell) for 1d6 rounds instead of petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Stun (Ex) If a mythic earth elemental strikes an opponent with two slams in 1 round, that creature must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.

Trap Weapon (Ex) A mythic earth elemental's body traps manufactured weapons that damage it. A manufactured weapon that deals hit point damage to the elemental (after subtracting its DR) is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 30 Reflex save. A creature can spend a standard action to attempt a DC 30 Strength check to remove a stuck weapon. Weapons that deal only bludgeoning damage are immune to this ability. The elemental can release any number of stuck weapons as a free action. The save DC is Strength-based.

Description

Infused with the power and wisdom of the deepest, oldest stone, a mythic elder earth elemental is a rocky bulwark against progress and change. They use innate magic and their very bodies to block enemy advances and preserve treasures of the earth.
