Description

A mortuary mask covers the top half of the face, leavrng the mouth and chin exposed. The design of this eerie mask evokes that of a human skull, although some mortuary masks have more canine or even demonic features. Regardless of the mask's appearance, once it is donned, a mortuary mask works to enhance the wearer's presence, making him or her appear more horrific and frightening and granting a resonant tone to the wearer's voice. These enhancements grant a +3 circumstance bonus on all lntimidate checks made while the mask is worn. In addition to this unnerving effect, a mortuary mask also grants constant deathwatch while it is worn, allowing the wearer to see the auras of living and dead creatures within 30 feet. The wearer loses the ability if he is blinded or cannot see (such as might occur while in darkness). Furthermore, the mask guides the wearer's hand against foes who are heavily wounded. When the wearer of a mortuary mask attacks a creature that has 3 or fewer hit points remaining, the wearer gains a +2 insight bonus on the attack roll.
