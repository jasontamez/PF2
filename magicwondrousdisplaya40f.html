Description

This emerald vest has four prominent
and bulging pockets along its front. The
wearer is always treated as if using a
healer's kit when making Heal checks
(Core Rulebook 161). Once per day, the
wearer can make a DC 20 Heal check as if
attempting to treat deadly wounds. If the
check is successful, it cures 1d4 points of
ability damage instead of hit point damage.
