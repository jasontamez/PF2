Special Abilities

Poison (Ex) Quills-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.

Quills (Ex) Any creature attacking a pilo with natural weapons or an unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a pilo takes 2d6 points of piercing damage each round it is engaged in a grapple. A pilo can also use its quills to damage any opponent it successfully bull rushes. Any creature that takes damage from a pilo's quills risks being poisoned.

Roll Up (Ex) As a move action, a pilo can tuck itself into a ball. This grants the pilo a +4 bonus to its natural armor, but its speed is reduced to 10 feet.

Description

These carnivorous marsupials, sometimes called tumblespikes, are irritable desert-dwelling creatures that even predators leave alone. They are aggressive and often attack creatures that are larger than themselves. Pilos plow toward their foes and attempt to gore these foes with their spikes, bellowing a wheezing series of grunts. When provoked by a creature much larger than themselves or a particularly dangerous predator, pilos roll up into a spiny ball to deter attacks. Their aggressive nature means that they often fight until they die or until their opponent perishes or flees. Though pilos are only 3 feet long, their muscular bodies and spikes-which constantly grow-contribute to their 80-pound weight. Like many marsupials, pilos carry their young in a pouch, which they protect by remaining rolled up except when hunting.
