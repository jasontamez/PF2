These monks often serve as enforcers and bounty hunters for monastic orders or lawful lords, tracking down those in need of punishment.

Tiaret the Huntress

Tiaret hunts violent criminals. She was once an initiate among a peaceful order of monks, but then her monastery was destroyed by brigands. Tiaret was the only survivor, and her firststint as a bounty hunter involved hunting down each of the attackers and bringing them to justice. Since then, Tiaret has continued to use her talents to capture lawbreakers. Though she prefers jobs where the bounty is wanted dead or alive, if she thinks an opponent might have value, she attacks with nonlethal force and renders the foe unconscious.

Combat Encounters: Tiaretprefers to work alone, as tracking an enemy requires a level of stealth and precision sellswords and spellcasters often lack. When forced to seek allies against a particularly powerful foe, she prefers the company of rogues and rangers.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Often sullen and stern, Tiaret is ever observant, always searching for those wanted by the law and trying to overhear conversations of people she believes are plotting to break the law. She has no tolerance for those who harass monks, cleric, inquisitors, or oracles. She believes in following the letter of the law, and cares little about the spirit.
