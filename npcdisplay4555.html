The sacred sorcerer is an agent of the gods, less constrained than a priest and armed with magic rarely used by other servants of the divine.

Evangeline de Jille

Evangeline is blessed by divine magic, but not quite willing to devote herself to the causes of good and order. Instead, she uses her powers to protect herself, travel, and learn more about the world. Though she seeks balance in her life, the innate goodness within her finds overt evil and cruelty to be repugnant, and she distances herself from such people and things that exhibit them.
