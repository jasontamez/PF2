Saving Throw Reflex negates (see text)
You throw a long, roughly 5-foot-by-10-foot spindle of elemental matter or energy (or nearby unattended objects in the case of telekineticists) up to 30 feet away, damaging all creatures and objects within any two adjacent 5-foot squares unless they succeed at a Reflex save. An energy blast infused with spindle deals its normal damage to each target, while a physical blast infused with spindle deals half its normal damage to each target. The saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
