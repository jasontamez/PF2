Description

From rural villages to bustling cities, many blame even the slightest misfortunes on the depredations of gremlins. Regardless of whether such creatures are truly to blame for a community's problems, many shrines and hedge wizards sell tiny charms to their neighbors, talismans meant to ward off lesser evils: gremlin bells.

Crafted from bronze, brass, or countless other semiprecious metals, these miniature bells-no more than an inch tall-hang from delicate chains or short silken cords and ring with a tinny tinkling. Typically affixed over doorframes or to precious objects, when rung frequently these ornaments supposedly ward off gremlins and protect those nearby from ill fortune. And unlike most such folk magic, expertly made gremlin bells actually work.

Gremlin bells have two uses. First, they irritate gremlins. Any gremlin that comes within 20 feet of a gremlin bell cannot make use of any of its supernatural abilities and becomes uncomfortable, typically seeking to leave the area (though it is not compelled to do so). Secondly, once per day a gremlin bell can be purposefully rung. All gremlins within 20 feet who can hear the chime must make a DC 16 Will save or be sickened for the next 5 minutes.
