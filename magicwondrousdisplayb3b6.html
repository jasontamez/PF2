Description

Breaking open this magically enhanced spider egg sac (a standard action) conjures a massive spider web in a square adjacent to the user. The web is 5 feet thick and up to 20 feet wide and high. The spider web is nearly invisible; spotting it requires a successful DC 20 Perception check in bright light. This DC increases by 4 for every step below bright light in which the spider web is placed. This effect otherwise acts as the web spell (DC 13). Alternatively, the user can enhance a web created by another orbicular sac. Each additional sac increases the duration of the web by 30 minutes and the Reflex and grapple DCs by 2 (maximum increase of +10).
