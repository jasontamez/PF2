Elemental Fist - Feats







Elemental Fist (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8fo1">Advanced Player's Guide pg. 158</a>
You empower your strike with elemental energy

Prerequisites: Con 13, Wis 13, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8.

Benefit:  When you use Elemental Strike pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally plus 1d6 points of damage of the chosen type. You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You may attempt an elemental fist attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (see Special), and no more than once per round.

Special:  A monk of the four winds receives Elemental Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt an Elemental Fist attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.

You can spend 5 stamina points to declare the use of Elemental Fist after making a successful attack roll.

Mythic Elemental Fist

Your ability to channel elemental power through your unarmed attacks is ferociously potent.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1029.html?ItemName=Elemental%20Fist">Elemental Fist.</a>

Benefit:  The extra energy damage dealt by Elemental Fist increases to 1d8 points, and you gain additional uses of Elemental Fist per day equal to your tier. You can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to add the extra damage from your Elemental Fist to all of the unarmed strikes you make until the beginning of your next turn. This counts as only one use of Elemental Fist, regardless of the number of attacks that you make in this fashion.
