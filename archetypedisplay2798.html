Nagajor legend states that when Nalinivati created the first nagaji, she chose a paragon of their kind to instruct in the use of exotic weapons, lore, and words so the creature could best serve her as a bodyguard and emissary: the original first mother's fang. Whether or not these paragons descend from a single nagaji, first mother's fangs of Nagajor have expanded their numbers over the generations, and they no longer speak with the full authority of the First Mother. In modern times, a first mother's fang acts as a servant of his nation, a skilled general and tactician in times of war and a noble governor during times of peace.

Class Skills: A first mother's fang adds all Knowledge skills to his list of class skills.

This alters the cavalier's class skills.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A first mother's fang is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Additionally, a first mother's fang is proficient in one exotic melee weapon of his choice and one exotic ranged weapon of his choice.

This alters the cavalier's weapon proficiencies.

Serpent Mount (Ex): Instead of the usual choices for a cavalier's mount, first mother's fangs ride on giant riding constrictors. These use the statistics of the <a href="druidcompanions9f03.html?ItemName=Snake,%20Constrictor">constrictor snake druid animal companion</a>, except that they are suitable mounts and begin as size Large at 1st level with no other adjustments to their abilities or statistics based on this size change. A serpent mount is considered to be a quadruped for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity, and its base land speed is 40 feet (other speeds are unaffected). At 4th level, a giant riding constrictor doesn't increase in size again, but it does receive all the other usual 4th-level benefits.

This alters mount.

Honored Warrior (Ex): A first mother's fang is expected to act as a military leader in wartime and a governor in peace time, and as a result, he must be versed both in the martial and political arts. At 1st level, he gains <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a> as a bonus feat, and if his Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the sole purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats that require <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a> as a prerequisite.

At 2nd, 8th, and 15th levels, the first mother's fang gains a <a href="_vigilantetalents.html">vigilante social talent</a> and a bonus <a href="feats3d6e.html?Category=Combat">combat feat</a>. When selecting his vigilante social talent, a first mother's fang can select celebrity discount, celebrity perks, great renown, incredible renown, instant recognition, loyal aid, renown, social grace, or triumphant return. He treats his cavalier level as his effective vigilante level when determining whether he meets a talent's prerequisites, as well as its effects. He gains the improved attitude and Intimidate bonuses from renown as if he were in both social and vigilante identities. When selecting skills with social grace, he must choose from the following list: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (geography, history, local, or nobility), Perform, Profession (soldier), or Sense Motive. He is always considered to be in his social identity for the purpose of social grace (though he continues to receive the benef its for both identities from renown). When selecting his bonus combat feat, he can choose from only combat feats that list <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a> as a prerequisite.

This ability replaces order.
