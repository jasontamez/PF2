Description

This sentry mannequin is designed to seem more lifelike than its common counterpart. After 5 minutes of assembly and coverage with the included loose hood and baggy clothing, this wire frame looks like a vigilant humanoid figure. It has pivoted joints with counterweights that move it in ways reminiscent of an alert guard every few rounds for 8 hours after it's set up. Creatures more than 30 feet from the mannequin must succeed at a DC 15 Perception check to realize it's not someone standing watch.
