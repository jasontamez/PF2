Description

This large crystal, sized and shaped like a loosely clenched human fist, perfectly accepts any wand. As a standard action, the hand can be loosed to activate a wand on its own at any target within range. Any such activation costs 3 charges from the wand. The hand can activate the wand for up to 4 rounds and then drops. It is considered attended by you for all effects that target items, and it exists within your space. The hand of the theurge accompanies you everywhere, whether you move by physical or magical means. If you have an unoccupied hand, you can grasp it while it is activating on its own as a free action; when so retrieved, the hand can't animate again for 4 rounds.
