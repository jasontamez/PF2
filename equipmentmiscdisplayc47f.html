Description

This ruby-red earth can be sprinkled over a 5-foot patch of ground as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Noncreature plants and fungi in the area grow with alarming speed, and the ground becomes weedy, difficult terrain for non-plant creatures. Any non-plant creature in the square must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or it becomes entangled by the surging plants. Any plant creature in the affected square is healed of 1d6 points of damage.
