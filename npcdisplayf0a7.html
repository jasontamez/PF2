Thalion Skytale

Thalion thinks of himself as the world's greatest big game hunter. He spends days-even weeks-tracking creatures he intends to slay, and sometimes hires his services to areas plagued by marauding giants or dragons. If he mistakenly attacks an animal companion or eidolon, he apologizes and asks to duel the creature to test his skills.
