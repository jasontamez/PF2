Description

This delicate metallic shell contains two sets of volatile alchemical substances, similar to those used in smoke pellets. When the sphere is broken, the substances mingle and fill a 10-foot cube with a cloud of dark gray smoke that lasts for 1 minute. The user can throw the pellet as a ranged touch attack with an increment of 10 feet. Partially tangible hands of smoke accost creatures in the cloud. These hands attempt to grapple anyone moving through the smoke (CMB +7). Upon successfully grappling an opponent, the hands attempt to maintain the grapple every round until the smoke dissipates.
