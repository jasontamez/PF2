Description

This floppy leather hat allows a boggard or other froglike creature to drain the strength of those it strikes with its tongue attack. If the wearer ends its turn with its tongue attached to or grappling another creature, the grappled creature takes a -1 penalty to Strength, and the wearer's tongue gains 5 temporary hit points. The penalty and temporary hit points last for 1 minute. For each round that the target remains attached, the Strength penalty increases by 1, the tongue gains an additional 5 temporary hit points (maximum 10), and the duration resets.
