Description

The palms and fingers of these leather gloves are covered in small hairlike bristles, resembling those found on the feet of geckos, that aid you when climbing. Gecko gloves grant you a +1 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. They also enable you to climb with only one hand; doing so imposes a -5 penalty on your Climb checks.
