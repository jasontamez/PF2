Tube Armor (Ex) A giant tube worm's shell grants it a +4 natural armor bonus, but is somewhat brittle. Once a giant tubeworm is reduced to fewer than half its hit points (9 hp for the typical specimen), its tube shatters and it loses its natural armor bonus.

Description

The giant tube worm resides entirely within its constructed, armored tube. It extends its stinging tendrils out into the water to search for prey. This and the hookfang are but two varieties of the giant sea worm'some grow much larger, such as the gargantuan reef worm or the truly colossal trench worm. Others, like the brine worm and the crimson worm, are much smaller.
