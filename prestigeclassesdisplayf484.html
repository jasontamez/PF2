Mysterious warriors and wielders of psychic powers, esoteric knights are as rare as the obscure techniques they obsessively practice. While others seek the perfection of mind and body in the pursuit of tranquility, these warriors aim to become perfect, dangerous weapons by learning occult secrets and mastering deadly fighting moves. Esoteric knights know that balance between mind and body is an advantage they can exploit against those who favor brains or brawn.

Every esoteric knight is different. They rarely form orders or train apprentices and guard their unique secrets with unmatched paranoia. Though anyone with the right mix of abilities can become an esoteric knight, the road to becoming one is filled with dead ends, eldritch dangers, and unexpected twists. Esoteric knights are most commonly found in the Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra, where mastery of both body and mind are common pursuits.

The following are the class features of the esoteric knight prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An esoteric knight is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.

Spells per Day: At the indicated levels, an esoteric knight gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a psychic spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one psychic spellcasting class before becoming an esoteric knight, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.

Instead of choosing a spellcasting class, a character with levels in a class that grants the <a href="classdisplayc359.html?ItemName=Kineticist">kinetic blast</a> class feature can add these effective levels to that class. If she does, she increases her effective kineticist level for purposes of determining the highest level of wild talents she can select, the effective spell level of her kinetic blast and defense wild talents, and the amount of burn she can accept each round. She continues to gain utility wild talents and infusions as if these levels of esoteric knight were levels of her class that grants kinetic blast. She does not gain or increase other related class features, such as infusion specializations.

Martial Esoterica: At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, the esoteric knight gains a bonus combat feat. She must meet the prerequisites of the feat. Her esoteric knight levels count as fighter levels and stack with any levels of fighter she might have for meeting the prerequisites for feats.

An esoteric knight can learn a new combat feat in place of the most recent martial esoterica feat she has learned either by expending a 1st-level spell slot or, if she is a character with the burn class feature (such as the kineticist), by accepting 1 point of burn as a standard action. In effect, the esoteric knight loses the bonus feat in exchange for the new one. She can change only the most recent combat feat gained. Whenever she gains a new bonus combat feat, the previous feat becomes set and cannot be changed again.

Psychic Esoterica: As an esoteric knight gains experience, she learns a number of psychic esoterica that enhance her offensive and defensive capabilities. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, an esoteric knight gains one psychic esoterica. Each esoterica can be selected only once.

Some esoterica require a character to expend one or more spell slots to activate. A character with the burn class feature (such as a kineticist) can accept burn instead of expending spell slots. She can accept 1 point of burn instead of expending a 1st-level or lower spell slot, or 2 points of burn instead of expending a 3rd-level or lower spell slot.

Battle Mind (Su): By expending a 1st-level spell slot as a free action while casting a spell or using a kinetic blast, the esoteric knight can cast the spell as if it were modified by the <a href="featdisplay8c30.html?ItemName=Intuitive%20Spell">Intuitive Spell</a> and <a href="featdisplayee15.html?ItemName=Logical%20Spell">Logical Spell</a> feats or grant the kinetic blast the benefits of the <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a> and <a href="featdisplayd50c.html?ItemName=Precise%20Shot">Precise Shot</a> feats.

Confounding Projection (Su): By expending a 1st-level spell slot as a swift action, an esoteric knight can project a duplicate of herself into the mind of an enemy within 30 feet for 1 round. This duplicate appears to the enemy to occupy an adjacent space and grants the esoteric knight the benefits of flanking, even against enemies who are normally immune to flanking. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Eldritch Armor (Su): When wearing armor or using a shield, the esoteric knight adds 1 point of her Intelligence or Charisma bonus (if any; whichever is higher) per esoteric knight class level as an enhancement bonus to her armor or shield (maximum +5). The esoteric knight can forgo 1 point of enhancement bonus per ability to instead grant the benefit of the <a href="magicarmordisplay8e76.html?ItemName=Glamered">glamered</a>, <a href="magicarmordisplay372c.html?ItemName=Shadow">shadow</a>, or <a href="magicarmordisplay4bf1.html?ItemName=Slick">slick</a> armor special abilities.

Each day when regaining spell slots, the esoteric knight can adjust these benefits and can transfer them to a different armor or shield; the benefits cease to function if the esoteric knight is not wearing the armor or wielding the shield.

Eldritch Weapon (Su): By expending a 1stlevel spell slot as a swift action, the esoteric knight can grant a magic weapon she is wielding any one of the following special abilities for 1 minute: <a href="magicweaponsdisplay998d.html?ItemName=Defending">defending</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay0b68.html?ItemName=Flaming">flaming, <a href="magicweaponsdisplayc7e5.html?ItemName=Frost">frost</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7362.html?ItemName=Keen">keen</a>, <a href="magicweaponsdisplay307a.html?ItemName=Merciful">merciful</a>, or <a href="magicweaponsdisplayf62f.html?ItemName=Shock">shock</a>. This benefit stacks with (but cannot duplicate) any existing weapon enhancements. The esoteric knight can alternatively cause the weapon to be treated as cold iron or silver for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction for 1 minute.

Phantom's Armory (Su): By expending a 2nd-level spell slot as a swift action, the esoteric knight can cause her attacks (whether weapon attacks or kinetic blasts) and her armor to be treated as <a href="magicweaponsdisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">ghost touch weapons</a> and <a href="magicarmordisplay58b9.html?ItemName=Ghost%20Touch">armor</a> for 1 minute, regardless of weapon or armor type or any other abilities modifying the weapons and armor.

Shadow Projection (Su): By expending a 3rd-level spell slot as a standard action, the esoteric knight can summon a phantom ally resembling herself. This ability functions as the <a href="prestigeclassesdisplay7b69.html?ItemName=Shadowdancer">shadowdancer's summon shadow</a> ability except that the summoned creature remains for 1 minute per esoteric knight level, and there is no penalty for the creature's death or dismissal.

Step through Reality (Sp): By expending a 3rd-level spell slot as a swift action, the esoteric knight can teleport to a space within 30 feet as if using <a href="spelldisplay0446.html?ItemName=dimension%20door">dimension door</a>. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The esoteric knight cannot bring other creatures with her.
