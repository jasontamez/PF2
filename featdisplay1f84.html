The foreboding tone of your dirge is especially effective at unsettling your enemies.

Prerequisites: Ability to perform dirge of doom.

Benefit:  The range of your dirge of doom ability is extended to 60 feet. Additionally, if a creature is shaken from another effect, the effect of your dirge of doom is changed to frightened for that specific creature. This benefit cannot cause a creature to become panicked, even if a target is already frightened from another effect.

Normal: The range of dirge of doom is 30 feet. A creature that is already shaken cannot become frightened by dirge of doom. Once affected by this feat, a creature cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.
