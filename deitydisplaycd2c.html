Obedience

While moving through a crowd of people (at least six individuals), whisper a prayer to Norgorber so quietly that no one hears you. If you suspect a member of the crowd heard you, you must follow that individual and prick her with a poisoned needle or other sharp implement. If you can't locate a suitable crowd, dig a hole at least 6 inches deep in the ground, whisper your prayers into the hole, and bury the sound. At the end of your obedience, dip a needle in poison and leave it on a road, jutting from a windowsill, or anywhere else a passerby might inadvertently prick herself. Gain a +3 profane bonus on Bluff checks and on Diplomacy checks to gather information.

Evangelist

1: Secrets and Lies (Sp) comprehend languages 3/day, detect thoughts 2/day, or clairaudience/clairvoyance 1/day
2: Noxious Bomb (Ex) As a full-round action, you can combine a vial of poison with a thrown alchemist bomb. The bomb deals normal direct hit and splash damage, plus the target of the direct hit must save successfully or suffer the effects of the poison. Only contact and injury poisons can be used this way. Creatures hit by the bomb's splash damage are unaffected by the poison. If you don't have the bomb class feature, this boon instead functions the same as poison expertise, the second divine boon for sentinels of Norgorber.
3: Secret Self (Sp) Once per day, you can use greater invisibility on yourself as a spell-like ability. When you use this spell-like ability, you gain certain gifts from Norgorber in addition to the spell effects. You gain a +4 profane bonus on Perception checks while invisible. You gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls made with thrown weapons, ranged weapons, and short swords while invisible as well. These bonuses apply only when you're using this spell-like ability, not when you're affected by any other spell or effect that grants greater invisibility. In addition, the invisibility effect lasts for 1 minute/level instead of the normal 1 round/level.

Exalted

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy94wj?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Gods-Hardcover">Inner Sea Gods pg. 108</a>
1: Poison Tongue (Sp) command 3/day, distressing tone 2/day, or suggestion 1/day
2: Masterful Poisoner (Ex) You know the best techniques for storing and applying poisons. Your knowledge of the proper methods of handling and applying poisons grants them additional potency. The saving throw DC of any poison you use increases by 2. This effect applies only to poisons you administer directly, including applying the poison to a weapon you use. Giving the weapon to another person reduces the poison's efficacy back to normal, as the weapon's new owner does not have your skill at storing and using the poisoned item.
3: Virulent Ally (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a piscodaemon (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 72) to serve you. The piscodaemon follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home in Abaddon. The piscodaemon doesn't follow commands that would cause it to act in altruistically good ways, and could attack you if a command is particularly egregious.

Sentinel

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy94wj?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Gods-Hardcover">Inner Sea Gods pg. 108</a>
1: Virulence (Sp) poisoned egg 3/day, delay poison 2/day, poison 1/day
2: Poison Expertise (Ex) Long practice has taught you how to deftly apply poison during combat. You can apply poison to a weapon or a single piece of ammunition as a move action. You never risk exposing yourself to the effects of the poison when applying it to the weapon, nor do you run the risk of poisoning yourself if you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon.
3: Death Strike (Ex) Once per day, you can make a death strike with a melee weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. You gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 5d6). If your death strike reduces the target to negative hit points but doesn't kill it outright, the target immediately drops to a negative hit point total equal to its Constitution score - 1 (one point away from death).

Antipaladin Code

Antipaladins who serve Norgorber are secretive and cunning. They prefer to strike from the shadows, even when the odds are already in their favor. They rely on traps, tricks, ambushes, and poison to weaken their foes. Their code reflects a cold and honest assessment of the human condition, and its tenets include the following adages. <ul><li>Innocence is ignorance, and ignorance is weakness. I will seek to shed my own ignorance, and encourage ignorance in my enemies.</li><li>I do not take credit, nor do I accept blame. I work always in the shadows.</li><li>A fair fight is not worth fighting. I will take every advantage I can. No tool is beneath me.</li><li>Cold eyes, cold heart. My enemies can expect no mercy from me.</li><li>Everyone is expendable, and I will sacrifice them all as necessary.</li><li>Each life I take shapes the future to my lord's desires.</li></ul>
