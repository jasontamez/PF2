Description

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma. All creatures with fewer than 8 HD are compelled to stop and pay attention to you. Any such creature that wants to take hostile action against you must make a Will save to do so. Any creature that fails this saving throw the first time it attempts a hostile action is enthralled for the duration of the spell (as the enthrall spell), as long as it is in the spell's area. It does not try to leave the area on its own. Creatures with 8 HD or more are not affected.

When you speak, all listeners telepathically understand you. You can make up to three suggestions to creatures of fewer than 8 HD in range, as if using the mass suggestion spell (Will save negates). Only creatures within range at the time of a suggestion are subject to it.

Material Component: An opal worth at least 200 gp.
