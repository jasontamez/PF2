Description

This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members
of the alchemist class. Once per day on command, a boro
bead enables the bearer to recharge any one extract that he
had mixed and then consumed that day. The extract is then
reconstituted and usable again, just as if it had not been
drank. The extract must be of a particular level, depending
on the bead. Different beads exist for recalling one extract
per day of each level from 1st through 6th. A bead works
on an infusion, but not a potion, elixir, bomb, mutagen, or
nonmagical alchemical material such as antitoxin.
