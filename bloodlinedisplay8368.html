The echoing cave-songs and the rumble and creak of primal spirits deep below the ground thrum in your soul and in all your family line. You are likely slow, steady, and stable in your thinking, little prone to wandering and preferring to instead find depth in contemplation.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you and the target of your spell are both underground, increase the spell's save DC by +1.

Bloodline Powers: The powers of the living rock are within you, and your communion with the strength of stone is refined and enhanced as your power grows.

Tremor (Sp): At 1st level, as a standard action, you can cause the ground to shake beneath a single creature within 30 feet, functioning as a trip maneuver using your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier in place of your CMB. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Rockseer (Su): At 3rd level, you gain the stonecunning trait as a dwarf; if already a dwarf, your bonus improves to +4. At 9th level, you gain tremorsense 30 feet. At 15th level, you can see through solid objects as if using a ring of x-ray vision for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Crystal Shard (Sp): At 9th level, you can touch a metal or stone weapon (or up to 50 pieces of ammunition) as a standard action, giving it the bane property against any creature with the earth subtype, oozes, or constructs made of stone or metal, for 1 minute. You can use this ability once per day at 9th level, twice per day at 17th, and three times per day at 20th.

Earth Glide (Ex): At 15th level, you can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water, with a burrow speed equal to half your normal speed. You do not leave a tunnel or trace of your passage. You can use this ability for 1 minute per sorcerer level each day. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

Strength of Stone (Su): At 20th level, your flesh becomes as hard as stone, giving you DR 10/adamantine, and you become immune to petrification. You suffer no penalties while squeezing through tight spaces and are immune to bull rush, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip maneuvers, and to push and pull effects as long as you are standing on the ground.
