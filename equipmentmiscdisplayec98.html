Description

This versatile tool is designed to help pry open whatever the user desires. A crowbar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to force open a door or chest. If it is used in combat, treat a crowbar as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.
