Healthy'Sluggish'Stiffened'Staggered-Immobile-Dead



Sluggish: A character rendered sluggish by Dexterity poison has dulled reactions. He takes a -2 penalty on Ref lex saves and all Dexterity-based attack rolls, ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to AC.

Stiffened: A character stiffened by Dexterity poison feels numb and stiff. He is considered f lat-footed and is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, even if he has uncanny dodge. He can't make attacks of opportunity.

Staggered: A character staggered by Dexterity poison is so slowed and stiffened that he gains all the effects of the staggered condition (except that he can take a full-round action if it is purely mental).

Immobile: A character rendered immobile by Dexterity poison cannot move his body at all. He is helpless and can take only purely mental actions.

Dead: The character's body becomes completely incapable of movement and dies.
