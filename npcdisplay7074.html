The swampwalker is a savage predator of the stinking marsh. He is familiar with its threats and uses them as tools to defeat his opponents.

Cullen Theoren

Cullen is a savage survivor in an environment that constantly threatens death from exposure, disease or predators. He hunts any creature that intrudes on his territory, and has little tolerance for weakness or mercy.

Combat Encounters: Cullen strikes at the PCs from the water or from an elevated branch, slipping away before they can approach before returning to harass them again and again. He may also try to lure the PCs into environmental threats such as deep water or quicksand to make them easier prey.

Roleplaying Suggestions: If Cullen observes the PCs navigating his swamp with ease or defeating a dangerous monster, he may offer his services as a guide, or trade information with them.
