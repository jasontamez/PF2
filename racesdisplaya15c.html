Ghoran - Races







Disgusting
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g9v?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Races">Inner Sea Races pg. 215</a>
Some ghorans' link to their past lives becomes corrupted, causing their taste to become particularly disgusting. Such ghorans gain a +2 racial bonus on Escape Artist and combat maneuver checks to escape a grapple against any creature that has a bite attack with the grab ability. This racial trait replaces delicious and past-life knowledge.


Replaces Natural Armor

Natural Camouflage

Some ghorans evolve by reseeding themselves in different locations. With each new seed, these ghorans take on some of the traits of the areas surrounding their new growth. Ghorans with this racial trait choose one terrain from the <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">ranger's favored terrain list</a> other than planes, urban, or water. These ghorans gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks when in their chosen terrain.

This replaces natural armor.


Replaces Natural Magic

Intoxicating Aroma
Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01w1y">Wilderness Origins pg. 12</a>
Some ghorans have an incredibly distracting scent. Once per day, as a spell-like ability, a ghoran with this racial trait can emit an intoxicating aroma that causes creatures within 30 feet to be fascinated for 1d4 rounds. Each target creature within range can attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half the ghoran's character level + the ghoran's Charisma modifier) to negate the effect.

This replaces natural magic.


Replaces Past-Life Knowledge

Creator's Legacy
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 16</a>
Infused with the druidic magic of their creator, ghorans quickly take to nature-based spells and spellcasting. Ghoran bloodragers and sorcerers with the verdant bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for sorcerer spells and class abilities. Ghoran clerics and druids with the Plant domain use their domain powers and spells at +1 caster level. This doesn't give the ghoran early access to level-based powers; it affects only powers that could already be used without this trait.

This replaces past-life knowledge.

Occult Scion

Created in part from an esoteric ritual, many ghorans are innately sensitive to psychic powers and influences. The ghoran gains Psychic Sensitivity as a bonus feat and treats Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (planes) as class skills.

This replaces past-life knowledge.


Replaces Past-Life Knowledge, Nature Magic

Fecund Earth

Ghorans were created to provide nourishment to creatures, but Ghorus also intended for the ghorans to help the land around them to grow and thrive. Once per day, a ghoran with this racial trait can cast <a href="spelldisplay0b35.html?ItemName=plant%20growth">plant growth</a> as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to the ghoran's character level.

This replaces past-life knowledge and nature magic.

Magical Absorption

Many ghorans are resistant to magic or able to dispel it. Some ghorans even gain nourishment from absorbing magic. Whenever such a ghoran succeeds at a saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability, she regains 1 hit point per level of the spell, though this affects the ghoran only if she is above 0 hit points. A ghoran can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her level. This replaces past-life knowledge and nature magic.


Replaces Past-Life Knowledge; Nature Magic

Spelleater

Ghorans were originally created to survive and thrive in a magic-blasted wasteland, and over the centuries some ghorans have adapted greater abilities to overcome magic in general. Once per day, the ghoran can cast dispel magic as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to the ghoran's character level. If the ghoran's favored class is a spellcasting class, the ghoran gains a +2 racial bonus on dispel checks (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 272).

This replaces past-life knowledge and nature magic.


Replaces Seed; Nature Magic

Martial Recollection (Ex)
Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 16</a>
The personal history of many ghorans is scarred with desperate struggles for survival, and memories of that conflict are deeply ingrained within their seeds. Whenever ghorans with this racial trait grow new bodies from their seeds, they reselect all combat feats known instead of reallocating skill ranks.

This alters seed and replaces nature magic.


Ghoran Favored Class Options

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, Ghorans have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored class.

The following options are available to all Ghorans who have the listed favored class.

Druid (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 16</a>): When casting spells that target plants or plant creatures, add 1/3 to the effective caster level, but only for the purpose of determining duration.
Hunter (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 16</a>): Add 1 skill rank to the hunter's plant companion. If the hunter replaces her plant companion, the new plant companion gains these bonus skill ranks.
Mesmerist (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 17</a>): Choose one mind-affecting mesmerist trick that the mesmerist knows. The mesmerist can affect intelligent plant creatures with that trick or spell as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects.
Ranger (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 17</a>): Add a +1/4 bonus on initiative checks and Survival checks when the ranger is in a favored terrain.
Rogue (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 17</a>): Choose one type of ranger favored enemy (or one subtype in case of either humanoid or outsider). The rogue adds 1/2 to her sneak attack damage when using sneak attack against creatures of the chosen type (maximum +3).
Shaman (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 17</a>): Add one spell from the druid spell list that isn't on the shaman spell list to the list of spells she knows. This spell must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level spell the shaman can cast.
Shifter (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 17</a>): Add 1/5 to the shifter's natural armor bonus when using wild shape to assume a major form.
Sorcerer (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 17</a>): When casting sorcerer/wizard spells that are also on the druid spell list, add 1/3 to the effective class level, but only for the purpose of determining durations.
Witch (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 17</a>): Add 1/4 to the witch's caster level when attempting dispel checks using dispel magic, break enchantment, and similar effects.
