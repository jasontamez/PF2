Item Mastery Feats

Using an item mastery feat is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, similar to activating a command word item, though you do not need to speak to use the feat. Creating these effects requires you to assault the existing magic of the item through your force of will and channel the item's inherent magic through your own body; this act is thus governed by the user's fortitude. All effects created by item mastery feats act as spell-like abilities and use your base attack bonus as the caster level. Any spell-like ability's save DC is equal to 10 + the spell level + your Constitution modifier. If a spell-like ability calls for a calculation using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus or modifier, use your Constitution bonus or modifier instead.

Magic item mastery is stressful for the item as well as the user and can't be performed on items that can be used only a limited number of times or that must be recharged (such as elixirs, potions, scrolls, staffs, and wands)-it requires items with constant effects or daily uses. Magic item mastery doesn't affect an item's normal properties or deplete any of its daily uses.

The following magic item mastery feats are available to any character who qualifies.
