When the creature burrows, it can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other nonmetal earth as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A <a href="spelldisplay729b.html?ItemName=move%20earth">move earth</a> spell cast on an area containing the burrowing creature flings it back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save.

Format: earth glide
Location: Speed.
