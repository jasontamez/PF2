You are adept at relieving foes of their belongings even while you strike.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplayf149.html?ItemName=Improved%20Steal">Improved Steal</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  On your turn, you can perform a single steal combat maneuver (Advanced Players Guide 320) in place of one of your melee attacks. You must choose the melee attack with the highest base attack bonus to make the steal.

Normal:  A steal combat maneuver is a standard action.

You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefit of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. You can spend 2 stamina points to change an attack that does not have your highest base attack bonus into a steal combat maneuver. You can use this combat trick only once per round, but you can use it even if you already used your attack at the highest base attack bonus to steal.
