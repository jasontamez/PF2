Description

The mouth of this shriveled, distorted head is stitched shut with coarse thread. A shrunken head can be used if it's held in one hand or worn in the neck slot by suspending it from a thong. Once per day as an immediate action, the owner can make the head absorb a mind-affecting spell of up to 5th level that was targeting the owner. Absorbing such a spell protects only the wielder, not any other targets. After absorbing the spell, the head's eyes open and burn with pale green fire for 1 round per level of the spell absorbed. While the eyes are burning, as a standard action, the wielder can unleash this energy as enervation, with the ray imposing 1 negative level per level of spell absorbed.

When used as an additional focus component for a spell with the fear subtype, a shrunken head augments its effects, increasing any save DC associated with the spell by 1. The shrunken head does not need to have absorbed a spell to be used in this manner.
