Description

This silver ear trumpet resembles the popular mundane item used for listening to Chelish opera and has elaborate spirals carved along its 1-foot length. While held to the ear, the trumpet makes it easier to hear sounds in a 200-foot cone emanating from the trumpet; the user ignores the DC increase for distance applied to sound-based Perception checks. However, this does not negate the DC modifiers for listening through closed doors, walls, or the like.
