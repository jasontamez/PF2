Healthy-Weakened-Impaired'Staggered-Immobile-Dead



Weakened: A character weakened by Strength poison suffers a -2 penalty on Strength-based attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Her carrying capacity is divided by 3. She is always considered to be carrying at least a medium load.

Impaired: A character impaired by Strength poison experiences rapid muscle atrophy. She takes an additional -2 penalty on the affected Strength-based rolls, and is always considered to be carrying at least a heavy load. Staggered: A character staggered by Strength poison is so weakened that she suffers the effects of the staggered condition (except she can take a full-round action if it is purely mental).

Immobile: A character rendered immobile by Strength poison cannot move her body at all. She is helpless and can take only purely mental actions.

Dead: All the character's muscles cease functioning, including the heart.
