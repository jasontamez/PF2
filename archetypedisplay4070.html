Most cultures tell stories of people stolen away by the fey, only to return years later, forever changed. The First World minstrel was changed in such a way by the fey, and his performances channel the mysterious powers of the First World.

Fey Magic: A First World minstrel adds <a href="spelldisplay0208.html?ItemName=summon%20nature%e2%80%99s%20ally%201">summon nature's ally</a> spells to his spell list instead of the equivalent <a href="spelldisplay4aa5.html?ItemName=summon%20monster">summon monster</a> spells.

This ability alters the First World minstrel's spell list.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A First World minstrel gains the <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">wild empathy druid class feature</a>, using his bard level as his druid level for this ability.

This ability replaces bardic knowledge.

Bardic Performance: A First World minstrel gains the following types of bardic performance.

Echoes of the First World (Su): A First World minstrel infuses himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet with the strange magic of the First World, granting the target one of the special abilities from the <a href="monsterdisplay27d4.html?ItemName=Fey%20Giant%20Toad">fey creature template</a> other than change shape for 1 round. For every 3 levels beyond 1st the First World minstrel has, he can target one additional ally or add an additional special ability to one of his targets. This is a polymorph effect that relies on audible components.

This ability replaces inspire courage.

Gremlin's Luck (Su): A First World minstrel of 8th level or higher can use his performance to inflict bad luck on a target within 30 feet for 1 round. Whenever the target rolls an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A target that succeeds at a Will save (DC 10 + half the First World minstrel's level + his Charisma modifier) negates the effect and is immune to this ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect that relies on audible components.

This ability replaces dirge of doom.

Resist Nature's Lure (Ex): At 2nd level, a First World minstrel gains the <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">resist nature's lure druid class feature.</a>

This ability replaces well-versed.
