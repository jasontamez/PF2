Description

Cocooning armor protects the wearer against planar hazards when she is defenseless, enveloping her in a thin, protective membrane. If the wearer falls unconscious on a plane other than her native plane, the armor grants her immunity to the harmful environmental effects of that plane, including toxicity, extreme temperatures, negative energy, and lack of air. This immunity lasts for as long as she remains unconscious.
