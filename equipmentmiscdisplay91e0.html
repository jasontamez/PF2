Description

This complicated lens fits over one eye and takes up the eyes slot when in use. When using it in conjunction with a ranged weapon, you reduce any range penalty on your attacks by 2. Objects within 100 feet become difficult to see, however, and you take a -2 penalty on Perception checks based on sight while wearing the hunter's sight.
