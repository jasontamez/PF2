The spiritual power of art and song runs strongly through your family line. This may be the result of ancient pacts made with azata patrons, or even an inheritance from a lillend or trumpet archon ancestor. It could also be the lingering taint of a less savory heritage, such as from a harpy or a forefather driven to madness by the disquieting gibbering of a shoggoth. However it came to be, your family's artistic bent shows itself strongly in your magic.

Beguiling Voice (Ex): At 1st level, you can use the sound of your voice to lull a target creature into taking no action. This ability acts as the daze spell, except it is language-dependent, has a duration of 1 round, and affects a living creature whose Hit Dice do not exceed your sorcerer level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Fascinate (Ex): At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use a Perform skill to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with you. This acts as the fascinate bardic perform ability, except the save DC is 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma bonus, and it lasts 1 round/level. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level, twice per day at 8th level, three times per day at 13th level, and four times per day at 18th level.

Perfect Voice (Su): At 9th level, you understand all efforts to communicate through sound, and can make yourself understood to any creature able to understand language. You can speak to, and understand the speech of, any creature that understands at least one spoken language. The save DCs of language-dependent spells you cast increase by +1.

Inspire (Sp): At 15th level, your artistic magic can inspire your allies to great accomplishments. You can use greater heroism as a spell-like ability. You can use this ability once per day at 15th level, twice per day at 17th level, and three times per day at 19th level.

Grand Maestro (Su): At 20th level, the power of pure magic music flows through you. You cast any spell with a verbal component as if it had the Still Spell metamagic feat applied to it, with no increase to the casting time or spell slot required to cast it. You gain immunity to sonic damage and language-dependent spells.
