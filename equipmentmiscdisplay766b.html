Description

This unique, salty alchemical powder is crafted in Darklands communities where fresh water is either scarce or guarded by dangerous predators. Consuming 1 dose allows you to go without water for 3 days instead of 1, in growing discomfort but without any negative effects. After this time, you must attempt a Constitution check once every 6 hours instead of once per hour to avoid taking nonlethal damage. One dose of drought powder functions for 1 week, after which penalties for thirst accrue at their normal pace (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444).
