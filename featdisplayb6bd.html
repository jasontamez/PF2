Your ally plays the part of a bumbling fool, making you look good in comparison.

Prerequisites: Bluff 1 rank.

Benefit: An ally who also has this feat can spend a standard action bumbling around, uttering gaffes, or otherwise making herself appear to be socially inept. The ally takes a -2 penalty on future Charisma-based checks against characters who witnessed her behavior, but you gain a +2 competence bonus on such checks. The penalty and bonus both end after 24 hours.
