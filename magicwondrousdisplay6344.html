Description

This small brass device is shaped like a compass or clock, and is designed for travel on planes without magnetic poles or set geography. When activated via a mechanical trigger, its geared arms rotate around to point toward the stronghold of either the plane's ruler or the three closest approximations, as per planar orientation, with the name or holy symbol of the entity in question appearing on the arm. In addition, pressing a lever on the back side can cause the device to switch over to a portal-finding function that acts as per locate portal, with a range of 3 miles.

Planar guides are notoriously tricky to make, and most have a 5% chance each time they're consulted of having their magic twisted to lead the user astray, usually pointing toward a hazard (such as the lair of a dangerous creature). This chance is cumulative each time the guide is consulted, but resets to 5% as soon as the user encounters such a hazard. Planar guides without this flaw are rare and can easily cost twice as much as the standard model. At the same time, those with a higher percentage can be significantly cheaper, and are sometimes even given away freely to Material Plane travelers by locals-these last generally direct the user to a specific hazard known by the giver.
