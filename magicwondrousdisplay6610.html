Description

These soft leather boots confer several powers upon the
wearer. First, he is granted the power to walk on water in
swampy environments, provided the water is no deeper than
5 feet-this effectively lets him move through swampy terrain
and mud at no cost to his speed. He leaves no tracks or other
signs of his passage as long as he's in swampy terrain, and
never becomes uncomfortable or wet from rain, fog, or other
forms of non-freezing precipitation. Finally, the boots grant
him a +2 resistance bonus on all Fortitude saves made against
poison and disease.
