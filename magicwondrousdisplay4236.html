Description

When wrapped around a wearer's waist, this belt grants a +6
enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary
ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. Furthermore,
as a swift action, its wearer can become incorporeal. While
incorporeal, he does not gain a deflection bonus to AC based
on his Charisma, but his natural armor bonus is converted to
deflection bonus. The wearer can remain incorporeal for up to 10
rounds per day. The rounds need not be consecutive.
