Familiar Feats



Description  Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy98d3?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Familiar-Folio">Familiar Folio pg. 18</a>
The following feats can be taken by characters who have familiars that meet the listed prerequisites. Wizards can take a familiar feat as a bonus feat, and witches can select a familiar feat in place of a hex. If you lose your familiar and gain a new familiar that doesn't meet the listed prerequisites for a familiar feat you possess, your new familiar doesn't gain the benefits of that feat. A new familiar that meets the prerequisites automatically gains the benefits of that feat.

When you gain a new level, if your current familiar does not meet the prerequisite of a familiar feat you possess, you can learn a new familiar feat in place of the feat your familiar doesn't qualify for. In effect, you lose the old familiar feat in exchange for the new one. The feat lost can't be a prerequisite for another feat you possess, and your familiar must meet the new feat's prerequisites. You can exchange only one feat in this way each time you gain a level.
