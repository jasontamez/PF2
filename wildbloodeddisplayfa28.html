The darkness between the stars calls to you.

Associated Bloodline: Starsoul.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast an evocation spell, you may select one affected target that fails its save to suffer the choking airlessness of the void, silencing it (as silence, but affecting only the target) for 1 round. This is a supernatural ability.

Bloodline Powers: Your magic is blacker than any night.

Black Motes (Sp): This ability works exactly like (and replaces) minute meteors, except it deals cold damage.

Voidfield (Sp): At 9th level, you can create an area influenced by the black void. This ability acts as an ice storm, except the area is also subject to deeper darkness for 1 round per four sorcerer levels. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one additional time per day for every three additional levels. The bloodline power replaces aurora borealis.
