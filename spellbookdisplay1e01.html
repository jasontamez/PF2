Ritual

Change Magic (Su) Even the nature of magic is susceptible to your powerful transmutations. You can spend this boon as a swift action to declare a non-transmutation spell you are casting to be "changed magic." This spell becomes a transmutation effect, and benefits from any abilities or feats that influence your transmutation spells and can be applied to the spell you cast (such as Spell Focus).
