Description

This jagged crown is composed of ice
that never melts regardless of the
ambient temperature. The Icecrown of
Irrisen is the royal regalia of the queen
of Irrisen, was crafted by Baba Yaga specifically for that role,
and has been worn by all of Baba Yaga’s daughters who have
served as monarchs of that realm. When placed on the head,
the Icecrown merges with the wearer so that icicles seem to
grow directly from her head. Once in place, the crown can be
removed only by Baba Yaga or upon the death of the wearer
or the destruction of the crown. The Icecrown of Irrisen deals
3d6 points of cold damage per round to any creature touching
or wearing it as it absorbs body heat (or 6d6 points of cold
damage per round to a creature with the fire subtype).

The Icecrown of Irrisen grants its wearer the following abilities:
fire resistance 20, spell resistance 32, and a +4 enhancement
bonus to Intelligence and Charisma (with ranks in Knowledge
[local] and Sense Motive, as a headband of vast intelligence).
The wearer doesn’t take penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and
Constitution from being of middle age or older (Pathfinder RPG
Core Rulebook 169), and retains a youthful appearance, always
appearing to be the same age as when she first put on the crown.
Once per day, the wearer can summon three elder ice elementals
that remain for 1 hour and follow her commands. In addition, the
Icecrown gives its wearer the following abilities:

Constant-tongues
At will-frigid touch, ice crystal teleport, Irriseni mirror
sight*, unseen servant
3/day-control weather, dominate monster (creatures with
the cold subtype only), ice spears*
1/day-overwhelming presence, polar midnight

Finally, the Icecrown of Irrisen gives its wearer the ability
to shape the ice that forms the Royal Palace in Whitethrone,
allowing her to create or destroy walls, doors, windows, and
even furnishings and decorations at will.

Destruction

The Icecrown of Irrisen can be destroyed only if the perpetual
winter that shrouds the land of Irrisen ends and the normal
course of the seasons returns. In this case, the Icecrown melts
away on the first day of Irrisen’s new spring.
