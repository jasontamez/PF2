Special Abilities

Fate Aura (Su) The herald's aura acts as consecrate and grants her a +4 deflection bonus to AC, a +5 insight bonus to AC, and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws. Any creature striking the herald from within her aura either is blinded or takes 1d6 points of Strength damage (herald's choice, Will DC 25 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Gaze (Su) Dazed 2d6 rounds (or stunned if 5 HD or fewer, or held for 2d6 rounds if undead), 60 feet; Will DC 25 negates. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the gaze for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect (or a necromancy effect against undead). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Incorporeal Form (Su) When incorporeal, the herald can use her spell-like abilities and gaze attack but can't make slam attacks.

Description

The Steward of the Skein is Pharasma's foremost agent, a mighty warrior sent to restore the balance of fate, announce auspicious births or deaths, or stem a rising tide of undeath. She often appears as an incorporeal shade, making a pronouncement and then fading away, though countless creatures over the eons have fallen under her armored fists. She stands about 7 feet tall but weighs a mere 200 pounds.

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each of Golarion's deities has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds' interventions on the Material Plane mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique outsiders of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer Hit Dice, making them available for summons via greater planar ally. Only a deity's worshipers can summon its herald; thus, even the most powerful worshiper of Sarenrae can never summon the herald of Iomedae. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like planar binding from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper's summons, granting its herald's service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Herald Subtype: Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific outsider subtype such as "devil" or "psychopomp" that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits. <ul><li>Always Armed (Su) Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a standard action. If its herald doesn't have a signature weapon, it can summon any nonmagical weapon as a standard action (including adamantine, etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald's grasp.</li><li>Emissary (Ex) Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using greater planar ally or gate, regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it's not an outsider.</li></ul>
