You can feint against nearly any creature.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay227e.html?ItemName=Mesmerizing%20Feint">Mesmerizing Feint</a>, Bluff 10 ranks, hypnotic stare class feature, psychic inception bold stare.

Benefit:  You can feint against mindless creatures at a -4 penalty. Such a creature must be a subject of your hypnotic stare, and the creature has a 50% chance of ignoring the effects of your feint.

Normal:  Feinting against a creature that is mindless is impossible.
