Obedience

Walk a road for an hour and keep a constant eye out for signs of fallen travelers or roadside graves. Tend to any of either you find. Gain a +4 insight bonus on Survival and Knowledge (geography) checks to find locations and avoid becoming lost, as well as on saving throws against magic effects that would force you to become lost (such as the <a href="spelldisplaya005.html?ItemName=maze">maze</a> spell).

1: Know Who Passed (Sp) <a href="spelldisplay0b49.html?ItemName=alarm">alarm</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplayc619.html?ItemName=perceive%20cues">perceive cues</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay0970.html?ItemName=speak%20with%20dead">speak with dead</a> 1/day
2: Wings of the Wanderer (Su) As a standard action, you can assume the form of a <a href="monsterdisplay0c14.html?ItemName=Giant%20Raven">giant raven</a> as if using the spell <a href="spelldisplayecf3.html?ItemName=beast%20shape%20II">beast shape II</a>. While in this form, you gain the raven's scavenger extraordinary ability, a +2 insight bonus to AC, and a +3 insight bonus on Perception checks. You can retain this form for 1 hour per HD you have; this time does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-hour increments. While in raven form, you can increase or decrease your size as a standard action, as if you had cast <a href="spelldisplay5a5e.html?ItemName=reduce%20person">reduce person</a> or <a href="spelldisplay3f10.html?ItemName=enlarge%20person">enlarge person</a> (self only); these spells have their normal duration, treating your Hit Dice as your caster level, but casting either consumes 1 hour of your daily shapeshifting allotment.
3: Terrain Dominance Your passage is rarely impeded by landscapes or weather. For every 5 HD you have, you gain one <a href="prestigeclassesdisplay2d11.html?ItemName=Horizon%20Walker">terrain dominance</a> as if you were a horizon walker; you do not need to have the terrain mastery class feature to select a terrain dominance. If you do not have a favored terrain bonus from another source, treat your favored terrain bonus as +2 when dealing with creatures native to the terrains over which you have dominance; you do not otherwise gain the benefits of favored terrain.

1: Prepared Traveler (Sp) <a href="spelldisplayd45f.html?ItemName=abjuring%20step">abjuring step</a> 3/day, <a href="spelldisplay4b80.html?ItemName=animal%20messenger">animal messenger</a> 2/day, or <a href="spelldisplay1cee.html?ItemName=phantom%20steed">phantom steed</a> 1/day
2: Seasoned Traveler (Ex) You no longer take nonlethal damage from moving at a hustle overland. You gain <a href="featdisplayb418.html?ItemName=Endurance">Endurance</a> and <a href="featdisplayc15b.html?ItemName=Nimble%20Moves">Nimble Moves</a> as bonus feats.
3: Into the Dead Roads (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, you can open a door to the Dead Roads and guide others with you to cross huge distances or travel the planes. This duplicates the effects of a <a href="spelldisplay71ea.html?ItemName=shadow%20walk">shadow walk</a> or <a href="spelldisplaydf57.html?ItemName=plane%20shift">plane shift</a> spell, with a caster level equal to twice your Hit Dice. In the case of a plane shift spell, the effect is not instantaneous, instead requiring 2d6 hours of travel by foot to arrive at a random point on the target plane.

2: Studied Hunter (Ex) You are adept at tracking, understanding, and assisting a specific kind of creature. Select a creature type from the ranger's list of <a href="classdisplay3a9e.html?ItemName=Ranger">favored enemies</a>. You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks to track creatures of this type or subtype, and on Diplomacy, Heal, Knowledge, and Sense Motive checks regarding them. You also gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks from creatures of this type. For every 5 Hit Dice you have, you can select one additional type or subtype to apply these bonuses to, and at each such interval, the bonus gained regarding any one studied type or subtype increases by 2 for skill checks and by 1 for AC.
3: Warden of the Ways (Su) You no longer need to drink, eat, or sleep to survive, though you must still rest with only light activity for at least 2 hours a day to renew your spells. While on a road, pathway, or tunnel, you gain DR 4/-; your GM has final approval over what qualifies as a road, pathway, or tunnel.
