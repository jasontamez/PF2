Brawl: This functions like the <a href="rules2b57.html?Name=Tavern%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">bar brawl in Tavern Events</a>, except you may attempt a Profession (soldier) check instead of an Intimidate check, and a failed check causes a loss of Influence and Labor.

Duel: This functions like the <a href="rules2355.html?Name=Military%20Academy%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">duel event from the Military Academy Events section</a>, except you may attempt a Profession (soldier) check instead of a Diplomacy or Intimidate check.

Impressive Results: Your mercenaries perform admirably, eliminating a problem quickly or defeating a more powerful opponent with ease. You gain 1d4 points of Influence and 1d2 points of Labor, and for 1d6 days the organization gains a +10 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day.

Mutiny: A member tries to take over the group, either by challenging you to a fight or by an underhanded method like attacking you while you sleep. You may handle this as a combat encounter or attempt a DC 25 Bluff, Intimidate, or Profession (soldier) check. If you succeed, the instigator leaves and you lose 1 point of Labor but gain 1d2 points of Influence. If you fail, you lose control of the Mercenary Company as if from <a href="rules15bd.html?Name=Upkeep%20Phase&amp;Category=Downtime%20Phases">business attrition</a>.

Rivalry: Another mercenary group is stealing jobs from your organization. Treat this as the <a href="rules0609.html?Name=Generic%20Building%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">rivalry event from Generic Building Events</a>), except you can also end the rivalry and gain 1d4 points of Influence by beating the leader in a duel (as the <a href="rules2355.html?Name=Military%20Academy%20Events&amp;Category=Downtime%20Events">duel Military Academy event</a> on page 122, but not necessarily to the death).

Scandal: Some sort of scandal strikes your company-a member is accused of murder or one of your teams injures locals in a bar fight. For 2d4 days you lose 1d2 points of Influence each day and the organization takes a -5 penalty on checks to generate capital. Once per day, you can attempt to repair the damage to your reputation and end the event with a DC 20 Bluff or Diplomacy check. Failure extends the duration of the scandal's fallout by another 1d4 days.

Schism: This functions as the <a href="rulesad08.html?Name=Cult%20Events&amp;Category=Organization%20Events">schism from the Cult Events section</a>, except that the skills you can use to attempt to end it are Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Profession (soldier), and that succeeding at the check means you lose 1 point of Labor and the event ends.

Windfall: Your organization is rewarded handsomely for its recent efforts, either with payment from a grateful employer or rich spoils from looting an enemy. You gain 1d10 ?? 10 gp, 1d6 points of Goods, and 1 point of Magic.
