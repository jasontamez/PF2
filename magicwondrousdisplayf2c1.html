Description

When affixed to an animal's hooves, these
iron horseshoes increase the animal's base
land speed by 30 feet; this counts as an
enhancement bonus. As with other effects
that increase speed, jumping distances
increase proportionally. All four shoes must be worn by the same
animal for the magic to be effective.
