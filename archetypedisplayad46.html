Bekyar Demon Dancer

While the twisted power of the demon-worshiping Bekyar's skalds is great, it comes at a terrible price.

Skills:  A Bekyar demon dancer gains Perform (dance) as a class skill.

Versatile Performance (Ex):  A Bekyar demon dancer can choose Perform (dance) for the versatile performance class feature. Its associated skills are Acrobatics and Fly. This ability alters versatile performance.

Fiendish Maw (Su):  At 3rd level, whenever a Bekyar demon dancer inspires rage, all who accept his rage gain a bite attack dealing 1d6 points of damage (for Medium allies; 1d4 points of damage if Small). This damage increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) at 7th level, to 2d6 (1d8 if Small) at 12th level, and to 3d6 (2d6 if Small) at 17th level. These increases effectively treat the affected creatures as though their sizes had increased by one size category, and so don't stack with any similar damage increases (such as the increase from the strong jaw spell) other than those due to an actual increase in size. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite attack is made at the creature's full base attack bonus - 5. This ability replaces the rage power gained at 3rd level.

Abyssal Wrath (Su):  At 6th level, the Bekyar demon dancer gains the fiend totem rage power, even if he doesn't qualify for it. At 9th level, he gains the greater fiend totem rage power, ignoring the prerequisites. This ability alters the rage powers gained at 6th and 9th levels.

Demonic Conquest (Su):  At 7th level, the Bekyar demon dancer's dances warp the minds of those who accept them even further. Whenever anyone affected by his inspired rage makes an attack against a creature, the urge to dominate this foe rises within the affected ally. The ally can attempt to resist this urge with a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the skald's class level + his Charisma modifier). If she fails the save or chooses not to attempt one, the Strength and Constitution bonuses of the demon dancer's inspire rage increase by 2, and she must continue to attack the same target each round. Once the target is defeated, she must burn or cut the symbol of a demon the Bekyar demon dancer worships into the target's flesh, which is a full-round action. The need to conquer and brand foes ends after this action or after the demon dancer stops performing, whichever comes first.
