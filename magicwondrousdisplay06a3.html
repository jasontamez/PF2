Description

These boots appear to be ordinary footgear. On command,
they sprout wings at the heel and let the wearer fly, without
having to maintain concentration, as if affected by a fly spell
(including a +4 bonus on Fly skill checks). The wearer can fly
three times per day for up to 5 minutes per flight.
