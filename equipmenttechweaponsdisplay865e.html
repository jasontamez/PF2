Description

Aura moderate evocation; CL 7th

The Technic League produces these unusual weapons as signature tools for the guards of Starfall and the Palace of Fallen Stars. A Starfall spade is a +1/+1 monk's spade and has a capacity of 10 charges. When the weapon strikes a foe, it automatically consumes a charge and deals an additional 2 points of plasma damage (1 electricity, 1 fire) on that hit. Attack that miss don't consume charges. A crystal button on the shaft allows for a secondary attack: a beam of plasma that fires from the forked tip of the spade. This beam is a ranged touch attack that deals 4d6 points of plasma damage (half electricity, half fire) on a hit-it has a maximum range of 40 feet with no range increment. Firing this plasma beam consumes 10 charges.
