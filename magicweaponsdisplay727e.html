Description

This special ability can be placed only on a whip. A prehensile whip can, as a swift action, be attached to an object as if it were a grappling hook. The whip can then be used to climb surfaces or to swing across a room or any open area. By spending 1 panache point as a free action, a swashbuckler increases a prehensile whip's reach to 20 feet for a single attack, and can use the whip with his precise strike ability even though it's not a light or onehanded piercing weapon.
