Description

This is a +2 shortspear, but each time it is used in melee
against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages its
wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes
effect, the spear curls around to strike its wielder in the back,
automatically dealing the damage to the wielder. The curse
even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such a case
the damage to the hurler is doubled.
