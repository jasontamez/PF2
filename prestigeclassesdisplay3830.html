Enchanting courtesans are elite information brokers who perfect their bodies and develop their minds to use illusions, enchantments, and other magical extensions of their considerable charms. Although enchanting courtesans are most commonly trained by the church of Calistria, their much-sought-after skills can be found in groups across Golarion, from the Tallow Boys of Kaer Maga to students of Jalmeray's Conservatory. Although some enchanting courtesans work with spy organizations, others sell their services to please or humiliate high-profile targets. In order to avoid alienating clients, enchanting courtesans usually take great pains to exploit and sell their knowledge only through intermediaries such as highly professional thieves' guilds.

The following are the class features of the enchanting courtesan prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An enchanting courtesan gains no proficiency with any weapons or armor.

Covert Spells (Su): An enchanting courtesan can cast divination and enchantment spells covertly. Upon doing so, the enchanting courtesan must attempt a Bluff check, as well as a Sleight of Hand check if the spell has somatic, material, or focus components. Observers do not notice that a spell has been cast unless they succeed at both a Sense Motive check opposing the courtesan's Bluff check and a Perception check opposing the courtesan's Sleight of Hand check (if any). If the enchanting courtesan has another ability that allows spells to be hidden in a similar fashion, he gains a +2 bonus on these checks. Casting the spell does not provoke attacks of opportunity from foes unaware of the spellcasting.

Enchanting Touch (Su): An enchanting courtesan can deliver a divination or enchantment spell with a touch, usually a kiss or erotic gesture, to a target that is willing to be touched by him. The target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks to notice or identify the spell being cast.

Seducer's Leverage (Ex): An enchanting courtesan develops a vast network of informants, comprised of those who have succumbed to his wiles or purchased his services, or whose secrets and goals he learned in turn from other informants. The enchanting courtesan can determine the influence any one individual has with any one organization or other individual once per day by consulting the network for 1 hour. Doing so also reveals the attitudes of the two parties in question toward each other, unless their particular relationship is a well-kept secret. The enchanting courtesan also gains 1 edge per 3 class levels that can be used in any verbal duel involving or regarding one or more of the characters or group members in question. See Chapters 3 and 4 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Intrigue for more information on influence and verbal duels, respectively.

Poison Use (Ex): At 2nd level, an enchanting courtesan is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison himself when applying poison to a weapon.

Seductive Intuition (Su): At 2nd level, an enchanting courtesan gains a competence bonus equal to half his class level on Bluff, Diplomacy, Sense Motive, and Sleight of Hand checks. He can use his total Sense Motive modifier in place of his total modifiers on Diplomacy and Sleight of Hand checks against targets who could be sexually attracted to him.

Hidden Spell (Su): At 3rd level, an enchanting courtesan can undermine a foe's mental defenses with surprise. The enchanting courtesan gains a +1 circumstance bonus to the save DC of his spells against foes who are unaware of his presence or consider him an ally. In these circumstances, the enchanting courtesan also gains a +1 circumstance bonus on caster level checks to overcome targets' spell resistance and to penetrate abjurations such as nondetection.

At 6th level, the bonuses increase to +2. A 6th-level enchanting courtesan can also undermine the mental defenses of a target that he is flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the bonuses are each reduced by 1.

At 9th level, the bonuses increase to +3, or +2 if the foe is merely flanked or denied its Dexterity bonus to AC.

Master Poisoner (Ex): At 3rd level, an enchanting courtesan can use Craft (alchemy) to change a poison's type. This requires 1 hour of work with an alchemist's lab and a Craft (alchemy) skill check (DC = the poison's save DC). If he's successful, the poison's type changes to contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury. If he fails the check, the poison is ruined. The enchanting courtesan receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his class level on Craft (alchemy) skill checks when working with poison.

Contact Poison Wielder (Ex): At 4th level, an enchanting courtesan can wield a dose of contact poison as a melee weapon. Delivering the poison requires a touch attack. The enchanting courtesan can prevent foes from noticing he is armed with a successful Sleight of Hand check opposed by observers' Perception checks. The enchanting courtesan gains a +2 bonus on this Sleight of Hand check. The enchanting courtesan can draw and open a dose of contact poison as a swift action. If he has the Quick Draw feat, he gains the ability to draw and open a dose of contact poison as part of rolling initiative if his hands are free and the dose of poison is not hidden.

Deluding Touch (Su): At 5th level, an enchanting courtesan can subtly deliver an attack by touch. His caress is so pleasurable that the target doesn't automatically realize it was attacked. If the target succeeds at a saving throw against a spell delivered via enchanting touch or a contact poison delivered via the contact poison wielder ability, there is a chance it doesn't notice the attack. The target attempts the saving throw again using all the same modifiers; if it fails this saving throw, it doesn't notice that anything is amiss even though it successfully resisted the effect.

Informative Liaisons (Ex): At 7th level, the enchanting courtesan has developed a network of contacts in each settlement in which he has spent at least 1 month. In this settlement, once per week, he can take 20 on one Diplomacy check to gather information without increasing the time to perform the action beyond the normal 1d4 hours. In addition, he can determine the result of one Propaganda check to spread or suppress a rumor (see page 14) per week as if he had rolled a 20 on the die.

Overwhelming Touch (Su): At 8th level, an enchanting courtesan's touch is deceptively and overwhelmingly entrancing. The enchanting courtesan's target must roll twice and take the worse result on saving throws against spells delivered via enchanting touch.

Touch of Ecstasy (Ex): At 10th level, an enchanting courtesan has perfectly mastered the sensual arts. As a standard action, the enchanting courtesan can touch a living target to saturate its being with pure bliss. An unwilling target can be affected with a melee touch attack. The target is filled with ecstatic pleasure for 1d4 rounds. The pleasure suppresses all pain effects during this time. The target must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 20 + the enchanting courtesan's Wisdom modifier). If it succeeds at this saving throw, the target is staggered for the duration. If it fails, it is stunned instead. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. Any effect or immunity that prevents precision damage negates this ability.
