Each legend grants you more of its power in return for greater influence.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayd472.html?ItemName=Legendary%20Influence">Legendary Influence</a>, lesser spirit power and propitiation class features.

Benefit: For each spirit you can channel, choose a second feat other than an item creation feat. Whenever you allow a spirit to gain 1 point of influence over you to gain that spirit's associated feat via Legendary Influence, you can allow that spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over you to gain the second feat.
