Description

This object was naturally struck by lightning and imbued with a spirit of the sky. Despite the name, this object does not have to be a stone, though small objects made into skyspirit stones are the most common, convenient, and prized. Once per day, the stone can be placed in liquor or milk for 1 minute to infuse the liquid with the spirit's power. A kineticist with the air elemental focus (aerokineticist) can drink this liquid as a move action to gain assistance from the spirit's power. For 1 hour after drinking the liquid, the kineticist can negate a single point of burn gained from using her kineticist abilities (this does not heal the associated nonlethal damage from the point of burn). This effect does not stack with itself.
