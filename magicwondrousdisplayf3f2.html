Description

These glass amulets hold bubbling red liquid and often feature a religion's or deity's holy symbol, most commonly that of Asmodeus or Zon-Kuthon. While worn, the amulet tinges the user's healing magic with a wash of ecstasy that acts as a magical drug, making the recipient of the magical healing susceptible to mental manipulation by the wearer. Anytime the wearer casts a healing spell or uses a spell-like ability on a single target, the recipient of the magical healing additionally must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become addicted to the wearer's healing spells. The wearer can suppress this effect by shielding the amulet from view with a hand or held item as a free action. The drug has the following statistics.
