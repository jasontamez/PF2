Wrecker

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 189</a>
Like unruly pets, some companions have a tendency to destroy nearby objects while unsupervised, and their masters can channel these destructive impulses into an advantage in battle.

Wrecker Feats: In addition to the standard feats available to animal companions, a wrecker can select Improved Sunder and Greater Sunder.

Destructive Wrecker (Ex): A wrecker's natural attacks ignore an inanimate object's first 5 points of hardness. At 9th level, a wrecker's natural attacks count as if they were adamantine for the purpose of overcoming a construct's damage reduction.

This replaces share spells and Multiattack.
