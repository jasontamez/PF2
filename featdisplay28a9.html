Dragon Roar - Feats







Dragon Roar (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8mcz">Ultimate Combat pg. 98</a>
The spirit of the dragon wells up inside you and bursts forth in a mighty roar.

Prerequisites: Str 15, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay12c4.html?ItemName=Dragon%20Style">Dragon Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist</a>, Acrobatics 8 ranks.

Benefit:  You gain one additional Stunning Fist attempt per day. While using Dragon Style, as a standard action you can expend two Stunning Fist attempts to unleash a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being shaken.

Special:  If you have the Elemental Fist feat (Advanced Player's Guide 158), you can expend a daily use of that feat to deal your Elemental Fist damage to those caught in the cone. This damage is not halved even on a save.

Instead of spending two uses of Stunning Fist to unleash a concussive roar, you can spend one use of Stunning Fist and 5 stamina points to do so.
