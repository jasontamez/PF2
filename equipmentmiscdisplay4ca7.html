Description

This thick-shafted arrow contains a reservoir of holy water and is designed to burst upon impact. A raining arrow damages the target as normal, and also treats the target as though it had been struck by a direct hit from a thrown vial of holy water; adjacent creatures take splash damage from this effect. A raining arrow imparts a -2 penalty on attack rolls because of its weight. A raining arrow costs 30 gp, and can be crafted with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.
