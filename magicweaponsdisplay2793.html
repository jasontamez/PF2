Description

During Thassilon's height, many of the empire's greatest soldiers, mercenaries, and arcane assassins wielded weapons infused with two allied schools of magic that worked together to grant the wielder additional prowess over practitioners of an opposing school of magic. Weapons steeped in enchantment and illusion magic, for example, held great power over wielders of transmutation. Such weapons were often banned in Thassilon, so wary were the runelords of their propagation, yet all seven kept champions and assassins armed with runeforged weapons targeting their enemies' weaknesses in secret.

Each runeforged weapon opposes a school of magic. T he wielder gains a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against spells from the weapon's opposed magic. All runeforged weapons are, to a certain degree, empathic. They enhance sin or virtue in those who wield them, so a fighter armed with a dominant weapon becomes more domineering than before, for example. Anyone wielding a runeforged weapon takes a -2 penalty on all Diplomacy checks, as her vices or virtues are magnified at the expense of personality. No weapon can have more than one runeforged weapon quality at a time, and a creature that carries two runeforged weapons (even those o f the same type) takes a -5 penalty on all attack rolls, Will saving throws, and skill checks, as her mind is constantly assailed by multiple empathic urges.

Each of the seven Thassilonian schools of magic is opposed by a single runeforged weapon quality-each of these being the combination of that school's opposition schools. The seven correct component combinations and the type of runeforged weapon each combination creates are listed below. Note that the first name for each type of weapon listed is its sinful name- the second is the name a virtuous character can use to refer to the weapon. In any event, a runeforged weapon functions the same, regardless of whether it magnifies a wielder's sin or virtue.

A wielder who is considered sinful or virtuous (see page 416) with the same type of sin/virtue as a runeforged weapon he wields becomes more aware of danger around him-gaining a +2 insight bonus on Initiative checks and a +1 dodge bonus to AC.

The specific effects of each of the seven types of runeforged weapons are listed below.

Covetous/Charitable (opposes evocation): A union of conjuration and abjuration magic, a covetous weapon functions as a bane weapon against evokers and creatures with the fire subtype. As long as the weapon is wielded, the wielder gains fire resistance 5.

Dominant/Commanding (opposes transmutation): A union of enchantment and illusion magic, a dominant weapon functions as a bane weapon against transmuters and against creatures with the shapechanger subtype. As long as the weapon is carried, it can absorb up to three harmful transmutation effects (such as baleful polymorph or petrification) inflicted on the wielder per day.

Jealous/Trusting (opposes necromancy): A union of abjuration and enchantment magic, a jealous weapon functions as a bane weapon against necromancers and against undead created by necromancy spells (not against self-manifested undead or undead created by the create spawn special ability). As long as the weapon is carried, it can absorb up to 3 negative levels inflicted on the wielder per day.

Miserly/Generous (opposes illusion): A union of transmutation and conjuration magic, a miserly weapon functions as a bane weapon against illusionists and creatures from the Plane of Shadow. The first three times each day that this weapon strikes an illusion, it automatically makes a dispel magic attempt to dispel the illusion.

Parasitic/Symbiotic (opposes enchantment): A union of necromancy and transmutation magic, a parasitic weapon functions as a bane weapon against enchanters and against creatures that are charmed, dominated, or otherwise under another creature's magic control. The first time each day that this weapon strikes a creature under the effects of an enchantment spell, it automatically makes a dispel magic attempt to dispel the enchantment. If the attempt is successful, it siphons that energy into the wielder, healing her of 6d6 points of damage (hit points in excess of maximum are gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour).

Sadistic/Compassionate (opposes abjuration): A union of evocation and necromancy magic, a sadistic weapon functions as a bane weapon against abjurers and any creatures with an active abjuration spell effect. A sadistic weapon shrouds its wielder in an aura of mock magic-when the wielder is subjected to a dispelling effect, that dispelling attempt instead targets only the aura of mock magic. If the aura is dispelled, it replenishes again in 24 hours.

Tyrannical/Liberal (opposes conjuration): A union of illusion and evocation magic, a tyrannical weapon functions as a bane weapon against conjurers and summoned monsters. The first three times each day that the weapon scores a critical hit against a creature with the extraplanar subtype, the weapon casts dismissal at the creature struck.
