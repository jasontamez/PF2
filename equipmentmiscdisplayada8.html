Description

An eye patch covers one eye and ties around the head. Pirates usually wear eye patches to cover injured or blind eyes, but some wear eye patches to look more intimidating, or to keep one eye covered and thus retain their night vision when transitioning from the relative darkness belowdecks to the sunlight above.
