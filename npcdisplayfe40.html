Boon A conjurist can provide hidden lore about one type of outsider, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on the next Charisma-based check PCs make with that type of creature.

Conjurists are arcanists who have studied the planes, irresistibly drawn to forbidden lore that shatters mind and morality. Conjurists may be exotic court mages or unusual war wizards. A conjurist will often keep a battle monk bodyguard or may have a hedge wizard or medium as an assistant (CR 7).
