Your animal companion has abilities that makes it different from others of its kind.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, animal companion class feature.

Benefit: Select a 1-point evolution other than pounce or reach from those available to a summoner's eidolon. Your animal companion gains this evolution. The animal companion must conform to any limitations of the evolution. For instance, only an animal companion of an appropriate size and base form can have the mount evolution.

If you gain a new animal companion, your old animal companion loses this evolution, and you can select a new 1-point evolution for the new animal companion.

Special:  You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select an additional 1-point evolution for your animal companion.
