Description

This armor exudes an exceptionally vile and bitter taste whenever something bites or swallows a creature that is wearing it. Any creature that grapples the wearer with a bite attack (or any other attack using the mouth) must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save to avoid immediately ending the grapple.

If the wearer is swallowed whole, the swallowing creature must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save at the start of each turn that the armored victim remains alive inside of the creature or become nauseated for 1 round. The creature may vomit up the victim as a standard action. This is a poison effect.
