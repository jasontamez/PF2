Despite the entropic forces inherent in ganzis, some forgo a life of chaos, instead harnessing their heritage to enforce the power of law. The chaos knight is able to tap into the nature of the Maelstrom in order to grant or gain small, unpredictable blessings to aid on her quest for order. The following archetype is available to ganzi characters.

Entropic Touch (Su): At 2nd level, a chaos knight can employ the forces of entropy with a touch to shatter a mind-affecting spell or effect currently affecting an ally. As a standard action, he can touch a creature to grant that creature a new saving throw against one mind-affecting effect, with a bonus on the save equal to one-third the chaos knight's level (minimum +0). If the chaos knight targets himself, he can use this ability as a swift action. A chaos knight can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half his paladin level + his Charisma modifier.

This replaces lay on hands.

Blessings of the Maelstrom (Su): At 3rd level, a chaos knight can harness the unpredictable essence of the Maelstrom to bless a creature. When he uses his entropic touch ability, the chaos knight can grant the touched creature a blessing from the table below that lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the chaos knight's Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Only one creature can have this blessing at a time. If another creature gains the blessing, the previous blessing ends. The creature rolls 1d4 and compares the result to the table below to determine the blessing. If the chaos knight targets himself with the blessing, he can roll twice and choose his preferred result.

At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the chaos knight can grant a blessing to one additional creature at a time.

This replaces mercy.

Aura of Chaos (Su): At 14th level, a chaos knight treats his weapons as chaos-aligned for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. In addition, the chaos knight treats attacks targeting enemies within 10 feet of him as chaos-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

This replaces aura of faith.
