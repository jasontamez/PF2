Forgotten Past (Story)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8x64?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Ultimate-Campaign">Ultimate Campaign pg. 69</a>
A pivotal event from your past eludes your memory.


Prerequisites: You must have suffered permanent
memory loss or have the Reincarnated background.

Benefit:  The duration of mind-affecting spells (even
beneficial ones) is halved for you, to a minimum of 1
round. Your inquisitive nature gives you a +2 bonus
on Perception checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in
Perception, this bonus increases to +4.


Goal:  Regain a major portion of your lost memories. The
exact means varies, possibly requiring a wish, assistance
from a divine being, reliving a past life, or confronting
the situation that led to your memory loss. This process
must involve encountering a challenging foe, though
possibly in ways other than direct confrontation.


Completion Benefit:  You roll twice whenever you
attempt a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect,
keeping the better result.


Special:  Restoration of memories by means less significant
than miracle or wish does not qualify for the prerequisite.
