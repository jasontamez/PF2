Sometimes, your choices might mean playing along with the GM. The GM is not your opponent'she's the conductor of a symphony in which you're a star performer. If she seems to be hinting hard toward a course of action, consider going along with it or mentioning to the whole group why you don't want to. The GM might also use any number of "special effects" during a horror game, such as providing certain characters with information only they know or asking to roll your dice for you in a specific situation. If that happens, oblige your GM. It could mean nothing or it could portend terrible things, but whatever the case, your GM isn't trying to cheat you. You're all just trying to make the game more fun.
