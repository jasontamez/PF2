Description

The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

The Azlanti devised this +2 longsword during their ancient wars with the serpentfolk. It has the bane property against reptilian humanoids, but this power also manifests against lizardlike or snake-like monstrous humanoids (at the GM's discretion), such as serpentfolk. Once per day, when the wielder fails a saving throw against an effect that would exercise mental control over her, she can immediately reroll that saving throw. She must use the new result, even if it is worse.
