The contract killer uses stealth and poison to kill his latest target.

Mollarn the Corpsemaker

Mollarn is an old elf, and the only constant he has found over the centuries is that people are fragile and prone to unexpected injuries and death. Having lost countless friends in his lifetime, he has given up on forming anything but the most casual attachments to others, and has transformed himself into an agent of death. Killing gives him no sense of satisfaction or pleasure-it is simply as common and routine as breathing. If he must kill others to reach his intended target, he does so without remorse or guilt.

Combat Encounters: Mollarn might arrive to murder one of the PCs or someone known to them. A victim could merely be an obstacle in Mollarn's path to his true target, and getting the person out of the way is enough to get Mollarn to proceed toward his intended foe.

Roleplaying Suggestions: Utterly without scruples, Mollarn might work for the PCs as an assassin. If he has been double-crossed by an employer, he might ask the PCs to help him get revenge, especially if the PCs dislike the one who betrayed him.
