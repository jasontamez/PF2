Insinuator

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9he0?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Agents-of-Evil">Agents of Evil pg. 20</a>
Between the selfless nobility of paladins and the chaotic menace of antipaladins, there exists a path of dedicated self-interest. Shunning the ties that bind them to a single deity, insinuators embrace whatever forces help them achieve their own agenda and glory, borrowing power to emulate divine warriors.

Alignment:  Any evil.

Code of Conduct:  An insinuator must always work toward his own self-interest, enrichment, or glory, and must also abide by the moral strictures of whatever outsider they have chosen to invoke that day (see invocation below). If the insinuator breaks an invoked outsider's code, he cannot invoke outsiders of that same alignment until he seeks atonement, although outsiders of other alignments may still heed his call.

Invocation (Ex):  At the start of each day, an insinuator can meditate for 10 minutes to contact and barter with an outsider to empower him for a day. An insinuator can freely invoke an outsider of his own alignment. He can instead invoke an outsider within one step of his own alignment by succeeding at a Diplomacy or Knowledge (religion) skill check (DC = 15 + the insinuator's antipaladin level). While invoking the power of an outsider, the insinuator radiates an alignment aura that matches that of the outsider's, and becomes vulnerable to alignment-based effects that target that outsider's alignment (such as smite evil or <a href="spelldisplayac6e.html?ItemName=chaos%20hammer">chaos hammer</a>). None of an insinuator's supernatural or spell-like class abilities function unless he has invoked the power of an outsider, and the alignment of the being invoked may affect how some abilities function.

This ability replaces aura of evil.

Detect Balance (Sp):  At will, an insinuator can detect strong moral leanings. This functions as <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a> or <a href="spelldisplay0498.html?ItemName=detect%20good">detect good</a>, but does not actually reveal the target's alignment, only whether the target is neutral (rather than good or evil) and the relative strength of that aura. This ability alters detect good.

Smite Impudence (Su):  Once per day, an insinuator can beseech the forces empowering him to punish their shared enemies. As a swift action, the insinuator chooses one target within sight to smite. An insinuator cannot use smite against a target that shares an alignment with the outsider he has invoked for the day. The insinuator adds his Charisma bonus on his attack rolls and half his insinuator level on all damage rolls made against the target of his smite. If the target is an outsider, dragon, or divine spellcaster with an alignment opposed to that of the outsider he has invoked for the day, the bonus damage on the first successful attack increases to 1 point of damage per antipaladin level the insinuator has. Regardless of the target, the smite attack automatically bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess. In addition, each time the insinuator declares a smite, he gains a number of temporary hit points equal to his antipaladin level.

The smite effect remains until the target is defeated or the next time the insinuator rests and regains his uses of this ability. At 4th level and at every 3 levels thereafter, the insinuator can use smite one additional time per day, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. This ability replaces smite good.

Selfish Healing (Su):  Beginning at 2nd level, an insinuator can heal his wounds by touch. This is treated exactly like the <a href="classdisplay3035.html?ItemName=Paladin">paladin's lay on hands class feature</a>, except it can be used only to heal the insinuator and cannot be used on other creatures. This ability replaces touch of corruption.

Aura of Ego (Su):  At 3rd level, an insinuator radiates an aura that bolsters allies and deters enemies. Each ally within 10 feet gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. Enemies within 10 feet take a -2 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of cowardice.

Stubborn Health (Ex):  At 3rd level, an insinuator takes only half damage from diseases and poisons, and none of his ability scores can be reduced below 1 by these effects. This ability replaces plague bringer.


Greeds (Su):  Beginning at 3rd level, an insinuator can heal himself of certain conditions. This functions as the <a href="classdisplay3035.html?ItemName=Paladin">mercy paladin class ability</a>, but these mercies can only be applied to the insinuator himself. This ability replaces cruelty.

Channel Energy (Su): At 4th level, an insinuator can channel negative energy, treating his antipaladin level as his effective cleric level. If he invokes a neutral outsider for the day, he may instead chose during the invocation to channel positive energy, but treats his effective cleric level as half his antipaladin level. Using this ability consumes two uses of his selfish healing ability. This is a Charisma-based ability. This ability alters channel negative energy.

Bonus Feats: At 4th level, an insinuator gains one bonus feat, which must be selected from the list of combat feats or <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus</a>. At 7th level and every 3 antipaladin levels thereafter, the insinuator gains one additional combat or <a href="featdisplay6233.html?ItemName=Skill%20Focus">Skill Focus</a> feat. This ability replaces antipaladin spells.

Ambitious Bond (Sp): At 5th level, an insinuator gains a divine bond with either a bonded weapon or an outsider servant. This functions as the antipaladin's fiendish boon with the following modifications.

Bonded Weapon: This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the first special ability added to a weapon must correspond to the alignment of the outsider the insinuator has invoked for that day: <a href="magicweaponsdisplay7ea1.html?ItemName=Anarchic">anarchic</a> (chaos), <a href="magicweaponsdisplay10ea.html?ItemName=Axiomatic">axiomatic</a> (law), or <a href="magicweaponsdisplay85c0.html?ItemName=Unholy">unholy</a> (evil). Additional special abilities may be applied if any equivalent bonus remains.

Outsider Servant: This functions as the antipaladin ability, except the insinuator gains a new outsider servant each day, whose alignment must match the alignment of the outsider invoked for the day. The outsider servant functions as much as an agent for the patron invoked by the insinuator as an ally of the insinuator himself, and may turn against him if he violates his patron's alignment or interests.

Aura of Ambition (Su): At 8th level, enemies within 10 feet of an insinuator take a -1 penalty on all saving throws. All allies within 10 feet gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws. This penalty does not stack with the penalty from aura of the crusader. This ability functions only while the insinuator is conscious, not if he is unconscious or dead. This ability replaces aura of despair.

Aura of Glory (Su): At 11th level, an insinuator can expend two uses of his smite impudence ability to grant the ability to smite impudence to all allies within 10 feet, using his bonuses. Allies must use this smite impudence ability before the start of the insinuator's next turn, and the bonuses last for 1 minute. Using this ability is a free action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.

Aura of Belief (Su): At 14th level, an insinuator's weapons are treated as chaos-aligned while he invokes a chaotic outsider, law-aligned when he invokes a lawful outsider, or evil-aligned while he invokes an evil outsider. If he invokes an outsider with more than one alignment aura, the insinuator must choose during the initial invocation which alignment his weapon radiates. This ability replaces aura of sin.

Aura of Indomitability (Su): At 17th level, an insinuator gains DR 10 that is bypassed by the alignment opposite of the outsider he has invoked for the day, or DR 5/- while invoking a neutral outsider. This ability replaces aura of depravity.

Personal Champion (Su): At 20th level, an insinuator becomes a living embodiment of his selfish desires. His damage resistance from aura of indomitability increases to 15 (or 10 while invoking a neutral outsider). Whenever he uses smite impudence, he adds twice his full Charisma bonus to the attack roll and doubles his effective bonus damage gained from the smite. In addition, he can invoke a new outsider patron by meditating for 10 minutes. This ability replaces unholy champion.

Ex-Insinuators

An insinuator who willfully commits self less acts or engages in violence that doesn't further his own ends loses all class features (including his outsider servant, but not bonus feats or weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). He can't progress any further in levels as an insinuator. He regains his abilities and advancement potential if he atones for his faltering ambition (see the atonement spell). If he violates the code of conduct of his invoked outsider patron, he must similarly seek atonement from outsiders of that alignment again.
