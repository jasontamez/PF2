Description

Wealthy Kalistocrats wear these elegant, full-length white gloves. Twice per day as a move action, the wearer of these gloves can repel an unwanted creature for 1 minute or until the wearer touches another creature, whichever comes first. Any creature attempting to attack or touch the wearer during this time must succeed at a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the sanctuary spell).

Once per day, the wearer can summon a surge of invisible force to knock back a single target within 40 feet. The wearer attempts a combat maneuver check to bull rush one creature or object with a +5 bonus. This bull rush combat maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.
