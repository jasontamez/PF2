Command Obedience (minor): You can touch an ally and say a quick word to remind her of her obligations, granting her a new saving throw against each enchantment effect that currently affects her. If the saving throw is successful, the enchantment effect immediately ends. This power affects only effects that allow a saving throw.

Tactical Readiness (major): At 10th level, you can rally your allies within 30 feet, allowing each to immediately do one of the following as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity: remove the flat-footed condition, take a 5-foot step, draw a weapon, ready a shield, or gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. You can affect a number of allies equal to your Wisdom bonus. These actions do not count against your allies' total movement or actions on their next turn.
