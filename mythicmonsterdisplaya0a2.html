Special Abilities

Disorienting Pounce (Ex) A creature that a mythic owlbear hits when using its pounce ability is automatically staggered for 1 round.

Description

A mythic owlbear may have been created by a mythic mage, or adopted as the favored pet of a mythic druid. Though as short-tempered and bloodthirsty as other owlbears, a mythic owlbear has the sense to avoid or flee foes more powerful than itself.
