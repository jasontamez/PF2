Description

Wearing these form-fitting fingerless black gloves makes
the wearer's arms and body more flexible. As a swift action,
the wearer can lengthen his arms for up to 10 rounds per
day, gaining an additional 5 feet of reach. These rounds
need not be consecutive. Attacking with these extended
arms is unwieldy, and the wearer takes a -2 penalty on
attack rolls, increasing to -4 if he is using two-handed
weapons. Even when his limbs aren't extended, the wearer
gains a +5 enhancement bonus on Escape Artist checks and
Acrobatics checks to avoid falling damage. The wearer is still
able to use hand-based natural attacks such as claws while
wearing the gloves.
