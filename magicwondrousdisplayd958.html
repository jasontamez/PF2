Description

This exquisite telescope is crafted of brass, ivory, wood, and carefully polished crystal lenses and silver mirrors, and is over 10 feet long. Anyone using a farwatcher must possess at least 5 ranks in Profession (astronomy) in order to use it-the device is simply too complex for anyone with less training to use it properly.

An observer using this device gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Perception checks to discern celestial bodies, as well as a +20 circumstance bonus on any Profession (astronomer) checks made while using it at night. A farwatcher can be used during either the night or day to look at celestial or terrestrial objects, though any object within 1 mile viewed through the telescope is obscured beyond recognition. A farwatcher allows its user to see things through it as though under the effects of true seeing for up to 1 hour per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be expended in minimum increments of 10 minutes each.
