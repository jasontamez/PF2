Description

These ceremonial clothes are worn when performing priestly functions within a church or temple, and aren't well suited to adventuring. A cleric's vestments typically include a cassock, stole, and surplice. The colors usually correspond to the deity worshiped, and while some priests may choose elaborate embroidery with ecclesiastical themes, others find merit in humble simplicity.
