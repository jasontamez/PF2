Your exposure to summoned creatures allows you to predict where conjured opponents will likely appear.

Prerequisites: Arcane Strike or Disruptive; <a href="featdisplayac6b.html?ItemName=Banishing%20Critical">Banishing Critical</a>; <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>; Spellcraft 8 ranks; arcane pool class feature.

Benefit:  If a summoned or called creature materializes in a space you threaten, you can make an attack of opportunity against that creature before it acts, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on the attack roll if you successfully identified the spell used to summon or call that creature.

Normal:  A summoned or called creature appears instantly when the spell used to conjure it is completed, allowing for no attack of opportunity against the creature.
