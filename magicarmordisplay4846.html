Description

Billowing armor constantly creates a cushion of elemental air around the wearer. The wearer is immune to additional damage from constriction and damage from being buried, although he gains no protection from suffocation. When the wearer falls more than 20 feet, he can attempt a DC 15 Fly skill check as an immediate action to reduce his falling damage by half.
