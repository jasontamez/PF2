This tied headband helps the wearer focus his ki more
effectively. Whenever the wearer spends ki points to make
an additional attack, that attack roll gains a +1 insight bonus
(+2 if the wearer is using a ki focus weapon with that attack).
Furthermore, the wearer of a headband of ki focus is immune
to the ninja's ki block trick or similar effects that block the
wearer from using ki points.
