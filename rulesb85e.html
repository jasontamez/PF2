Combating possession ranks among the most unusual and dangerous acts heroes might ever have to perform.

Detecting Possession: Spells like <a href="spelldisplay48dc.html?ItemName=detect%20evil">detect evil</a> reveal contradictory information when targeting the victim of fiendish influence, revealing multiple auras emanating from one being. Skilled exorcists might also detect a possession. Both Perception (for physical effects) and Sense Motive (for spiritual effects) might reveal a fiend as its possession actions influence an individual, though they do nothing to detect a dormant fiend.

Ending Possession: The most direct way to expel a possessing fiend is via <a href="spelldisplayb63e.html?ItemName=banishment">banishment</a>, <a href="spelldisplayeb0a.html?ItemName=dismissal">dismissal</a>, or <a href="spelldisplaye385.html?ItemName=dispel%20evil">dispel evil</a> (or <a href="spelldisplay977b.html?ItemName=dispel%20law">dispel law</a> or <a href="spelldisplay4d78.html?ItemName=dispel%20chaos">dispel chaos</a>, depending on the type of fiend). These spells drive the fiend from its host, but do not return the creature to its home plane, typically causing the monstrosity to manifest in its true form nearby. Many fiends, however, find this kind of exposure counterproductive to their ultimate goals and flee to seek another suitable host, while others might become enraged and attack the meddling exorcist.

A far riskier method of ending a possession involves an invitation by the exorcist to the possessing fiend to leave its current host to take up residence in the exorcist's body (or in the body of a nearby volunteer). An exorcist can force a possessing fiend to leave its current host and attempt the new possession by making a successful Intimidate check to demoralize the fiend. Typically, the exorcist taking such a bold risk hopes to make his own saving throw to resist the possession or protects himself with magic before making this risky attempt. If the fiend fails to possess the exorcist, it can immediately try to repossess its original host, who can attempt to resist this possession by making a Will save. If the fiend fails to return to its host, it manifests in its physical form in a space adjacent to the host, and is typically infuriated.
