Description

This golden amulet is used by religious sects as a way to help
the faithful capture fugitives or defend themselves without
doing undue harm to potential converts. While the wearer
is using her divine powers of retribution (such as a cleric's
smite, an inquisitor's smiting judgment, or a paladin's smite),
the amulet grants her the ability to make unarmed strikes in
melee combat as if she had the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.
