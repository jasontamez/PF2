Description

The following weapon is generally available only to members of the indicated race or ethnicity.

Elves live in communion with the land-and the land can be an effective ally. This +1/+1 quarterstaff is carved to look like it's covered in ivy and vines. When the staff strikes a foe, the wielder can cause that creature to be immediately enveloped in creeping vines from the staff and any nearby plants. If the creature fails a DC 14 Reflex save, it is entangled for 1d4 rounds (though the foe is not anchored to the staff). Once this ability has been used, the carvings of vines and ivy on the staff disappear. The entanglement ability can't be used again for 1d6 hours while the carvings regrow to their full size.

Once per week, the owner can plant a treekeeper's staff in the ground overnight to create the enrichment effect of plant growth. While holding the staff, the wielder can speak with plants, as per the spell, with any plants that have their productivity increased in this way.
