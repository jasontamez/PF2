Monk of the Mantis

A body contains many points where the flesh, mind, and spirit coincide. A monk of the mantis is skilled at manipulating these points. With precise strikes, she temporarily disrupts a body's connection with the rest of the self.

Pressuring Strikes (Ex):  At 2nd level, a monk of the mantis gains the sneak attack ability. This ability functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except it can be used only during a flurry of blows. The initial sneak attack damage is +1d6, and the damage increases by 1d6 every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces the monk's 2nd-, 6th-, 10th-, 14th-, and 18th-level bonus feats.

Debilitating Blows (Ex):  A monk of the mantis's knowledge of anatomy allows her to deal blows that both deal damage and impose debilitating conditions. At 7th level, if a monk of the mantis stuns a target with Stunning Fist, the target is also entangled for 1 round after the Stunning Fist effect ends. At 11th level, if the monk of the mantis stuns a target with Stunning Fist, the target is also exhausted for 1 round after the Stunning Fist effect ends. At 13th level, the monk can spend 1 point from her ki pool as part of her Stunning Fist attack to increase the duration of these additional effects to a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom bonus (minimum 2 rounds). This ability replaces wholeness of body, diamond body, and diamond soul. (For the unchained monk from Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained, this ability is gained at 6th level, improves at 10th and 12th levels, and replaces the ki powers gained at those levels.)

Disabling Palm (Su):  At 15th level, a monk of the mantis can render the target of her quivering palm unconscious instead of killing the creature. Upon failing its Fortitude saving throw, the target either is knocked unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the monk of the mantis's monk level or dies (the monk of the mantis's choice). This alters quivering palm. (For the monk class from Pathfinder Unchained, this ability applies only if the monk selects the quivering palm ki power.)
