Orang-pendaks are a rare offshoot of the sasquatch species that dwells in remote mountainous jungles. Elusive and shy, they are rarely seen by other races. Given their friendship with apes (gibbons and orangutans in particular) and their hunched posture and shaggy fur- ranging from tawny or reddish to dark brown or black- they are often mistaken for those beasts at a distance. Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar appearance, the species are not closely related. Within their remote holds, Orang-pendaks cluster together into seminomadic tribes, hunting and gathering in a region until food and game becomes scarce, then moving on to the next area. Many tribes follow a regional pattern to this migration, allowing parts of the jungle to repopulate and gathering only enough substance so as not to disrupt the land's ability to recoup the losses. Orang-pendaks range from 3 to 5 feet tall as adults, weighing up to 150 pounds, and they are quite strong for their size. Orang-pendaks are largely herbivorous, but sometimes hunt with spears, clubs, and bolas.
