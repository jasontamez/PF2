Description

This palm-sized cross has arms of equal length and an emblem etched at the center. When purchased, the bearer's personal emblem or motto is etched on one side, and name, rank, and nation on the other. Common crusader's crosses are typically made of wood, while masterwork crosses-usually reserved for nobles, officers, or gifts to the families of fallen heroes-might be made of silver. The sidebar on page 19 for uses of crusader's crosses.
