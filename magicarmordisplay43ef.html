Description

This battered yet lovingly polished +1 breastplate is marked
by three chipped glass circles set over the heart, each of a
different color. Three times per day, the wearer may tap a
circle to activate it, enveloping her in a shimmering aura
that protects her from harm. The wearer gains DR 10/-
and is protected if she were under the effects of a globe of
invulnerability spell. The effect ends as soon as the wearer
makes an offensive action or casts an offensive spell, or after
1 minute. In addition, whenever the wearer casts a cure spell
or administers a cure potion while under this effect, she may
add one additional die to the total amount of damage healed.
