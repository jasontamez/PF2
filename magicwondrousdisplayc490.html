Description

This adamantine piton is 6 inches long. As a standard
action, the bearer may push the nail by hand into any
non-living material, including metal, stone, or wood. The
bearer may push it through more than one item at a time,
so long as the total thickness is not greater than the length
of the nail. Once pushed into place, the nail is held firmly
as if it had been hammered there (a DC 20 Strength check
to remove it), although the creature who put it there can
remove it as a move action. Once removed, the nail leaves
no hole or other sign of its presence. The nail can support
500 pounds. If used to hold a door shut, increase the break DC of the door by +2. If pressed into a lock, the lock cannot
be opened until the nail is removed. Once removed, the
nail loses all its powers and transforms into a nonmagical
iron piton.
