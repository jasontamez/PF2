Just like nations, towns and cities are ruled by governments. A settlement's government not only helps to establish the flavor and feel of the community but also adjusts its modifiers. Choose one of the following as the settlement's government.

Autocracy: A single individual chosen by the people rules the community. This leader's actual title can vary- mayor, burgomaster, lord, or even royal titles like duke or prince are common. (No modifiers)

Council: A group of councilors, often composed of guild masters or members of the aristocracy, leads the settlement. (Society +4; Law and Lore -2)

Magical: An individual or group with potent magical power, such as a high priest, an archwizard, or even a magical monster, leads the community. (Lore +2; Corruption and Society -2; increase spellcasting by 1 level)

Overlord: The community's ruler is a single individual who either seized control or inherited command of the settlement. (Corruption and Law +2; Crime and Society -2)

Secret Syndicate: An unofficial or illegal group like a thieves' guild rules the settlement-they may use a puppet leader to maintain secrecy, but the group members pull the strings in town. (Corruption, Economy, and Crime +2; Law -6)
