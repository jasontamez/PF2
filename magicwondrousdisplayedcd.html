Description

This iron pot is large enough for two Medium humanoids
to stand in comfortably. Upon command, the cauldron and
up to 500 pounds of additional weight can fly as if using
overland flight. The cauldron moves under the direction
of the person who spoke the activating command word. It
can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces
its speed to 30 feet. It can hover in place without the need
for a Fly skill check. The cauldron provides partial cover
for anyone standing in it. It has a hardness of 10 and 60
hit points.
