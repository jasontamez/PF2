Once per day, the power of your faith surges, further empowering your judgments.

Prerequisites: Judgment class feature.

Benefit:  Once per day, you can treat your class level for your judgment class feature as if it were 3 higher than normal. If you have multiple judgments active at the same time, this benefit applies to all of them.
