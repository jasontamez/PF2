Description

This sash of white silk embroidered with golden suns never
tears, fades, or soils. Once per day, a paladin wearing this
baldric can select three extra mercies of her level or lower
she does not already know and add them to the list of
mercies she can use for the day. She has access to these
mercies for 24 hours. When the wearer uses a mercy to
remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison,
the mercy actually cures the source curse, disease, or poison
rather than merely suppressing it for 1 hour.
