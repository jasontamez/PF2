Description

This set of +2 elven chain grants its wearer a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and other effects created by worshipers and minions of a specific demon lord, chosen when the armor is created. Against such foes, the armor's enhancement bonus increases to +4. The first suit of this armor was created quite recently by Perelir for her close friend Malindil as part of the ranger's vengeful crusade against Abraxas; since then, many other suits focused against other powerful demons (particularly the nascent demon lord Treerazer) have been crafted.
