Description

Wayfinders of revelation show a more ornate design than ordinary wayfinders, and are crafted of gold-accented silver. A wayfinder of revelation's light effect is double the normal effect of a light spell, illuminating an area twice as large. Once per day as a standard action, while a wayfinder of revelation is creating light, you can fill this 40-foot radius of light with an invisibility purge effect (as per the spell). This effect also makes it easier to notice secret doors and hidden compartments-characters who search for such hidden objects and portals inside this area gain a +10 bonus on their Perception checks to do so. Once activated, this effect remains active for 6 rounds.
