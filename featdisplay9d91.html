With brute force, you can bowl over and cripple opponents by treading on them.

Prerequisites: Str 23, Int 13, <a href="featdisplay71e5.html?ItemName=Brute%20Stomp">Brute Stomp</a>, <a href="featdisplay72e7.html?ItemName=Brute%20Style">Brute Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, <a href="featdisplay6051.html?ItemName=Improved%20Overrun">Improved Overrun</a>, <a href="featdisplay195e.html?ItemName=Improved%20Trip">Improved Trip</a>, <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplayd091.html?ItemName=Vicious%20Stomp">Vicious Stomp</a>, base attack bonus +10.

Benefit: While using Brute Style, when you successfully perform an overrun or trip combat maneuver against an opponent that causes that opponent to fall prone, your opponent takes 1d6 points of Strength damage, and its base speed is halved until the Strength damage is healed. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) reduces the Strength damage to 1 point and negates the movement speed reduction.
