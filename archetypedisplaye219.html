Like the urban barbarian (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 31), the urban bloodrager has learned to control her rage in so-called polite society. Though she lacks the untamed resilience of her wilder fellows, she's an expert at keeping her rage from causing collateral damage in crowds.

Class Skills:  An urban bloodrager adds Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Linguistics (Int), and Profession (Wis) as class skills, and removes Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), and Survival (Wis). This alters the bloodrager's class skills.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  An urban bloodrager isn't proficient with shields. This alters the bloodrager's weapon and armor proficiencies.

Controlled Bloodrage:  When an urban bloodrager rages, she does not gain the normal benefits. Instead, she can apply a +4 morale bonus to her Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater bloodrage and to +8 when she gains mighty bloodrage. She can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. When using a controlled bloodrage, an urban bloodrager gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, and can still use Charisma-, Dexterity-, and Intelligence-based skills. A controlled bloodrage still counts as a bloodrage for the purposes of any spells, feats, and other effects. This ability alters bloodrage.

Restrained Magic (Su):  At 3rd level, an urban bloodrager can attune her spells so they are less likely to impact her allies or innocent bystanders. When the bloodrager casts a spell, she can grant a +2 bonus on the saving throw against that spell to any creatures she is aware of that are targeted by the spell or within the spell's area. Any creature that receives this bonus and succeeds at its save is unaffected by the spell, as if it hadn't been targeted or wasn't in the area. This ability replaces blood sanctuary.

Adopted Magic:  At 7th level, an urban bloodrager learns some of the secrets of other magical traditions from other denizens of the city. She can select from the <a href="spells190c.html?Class=Bard">bard</a> or <a href="spells73c7.html?Class=Magus">magus</a> spell list any spell of a level she can cast, and add it to her bloodrager spell list and to her bloodrager spells known. At 10th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the urban bloodrager can add another such spell to her spell list and spells known. If she chooses to learn a new spell in place of an old one, she can exchange a bard or magus spell for another. This ability replaces damage reduction.

Bloodline:  The following bloodlines are especially suitable for an urban bloodrager, reflecting either a more nuanced origin or ancestry from city-dwelling magical creatures: <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplay20be.html?ItemName=Aberrant">aberrant</a>, <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplayaee0.html?ItemName=Arcane">arcane</a>, <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplay9813.html?ItemName=Celestial">celestial</a>, <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplay4903.html?ItemName=Destined">destined</a>, <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplay423f.html?ItemName=Infernal">infernal</a>, and <a href="bloodragerbloodlinedisplaya695.html?ItemName=Undead">undead</a>.
