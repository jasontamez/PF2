Description

The first Sihedron Tomes were said to have been crafted by a dragon in the service of Emperor Xin. Each of these books has a unique appearance, and hold an infinite number of pages for spellcasters to inscribe spells upon. Any wizard who prepares spells from a Sihedron Tome, which potentially holds libraries worth of arcane knowledge, may prepare bonus spells as if her Intelligence were 6 points higher. This is not an actual bonus to Intelligence and grants the user no additional benefit. Karzoug's Sihedron Tome contains all sorcerer/wizard spells (save for those of the schools of Enchantment and Illusion) found in the Core Rulebook and this book-at the GM's discretion, it can certainly hold more spells.

Destruction

A special 9th-level spell must be designed that exists only to destroy the specific and particular Sihedron Tome into which it is inscribed. This spell, which has numerous expensive and rare material components, must then be cast on the Sihedron Tome by its owner.
