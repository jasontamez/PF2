Description

Dwarven trail rations consist of smoked sausages and salted meat, rounded out with hard biscuits and dried vegetables. If you are a dwarf who subsists on nothing but these rations for at least 1 week, you can hustle or make a forced march for an additional hour without ill effects, but cannot do both in the same day. This benefit lasts until you eat a meal other than the rations or go for a full day without eating a day's worth.
