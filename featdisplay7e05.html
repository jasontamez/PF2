Bull-Catcher Wrangler (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9s7z">Monster Hunter's Handbook pg. 9</a>
You can wrestle a charging foe to the ground.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplaye9a7.html?ItemName=Bull-Catcher%20Style">Bull-Catcher Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay1e2c.html?ItemName=Bull-Catcher%20Toss">Bull-Catcher Toss</a>, <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, Improved Unarmed Strike; base attack bonus +12, brawler level 8th, or monk level 8th.

Benefit: When a creature is charging you, and you successfully grapple it with the Bull-Catcher Style feat, you can immediately move it as per the Bull-Catcher Toss feat. Once the creature is moved, you can break your grapple as an immediate action. If you do, select another creature in the repositioned target's threatened area. That creature becomes the new target of the initial charge attack.
