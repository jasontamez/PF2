Description

Hurling this crystalline, ember-filled vial at an enemy causes the vessel to erupt in a burst of green smoke and burning ash that coalesces into a fire-blackened skull with burning eyes. Wreathed in oily, acrid smoke and trailing hot embers, the skull corkscrews around its target uttering biting insults and dire curses. The black smoke left in its wake causes watering eyes and wracking coughs.

When a scourge vial is thrown as a ranged touch attack, the skull torments any single struck creature of size Large or smaller. The skull moves with the target, distracting it in combat with its chaotic orbit. Any combatant in melee with the target is considered to be flanking with the skull.

The skull's trailing smoke and embers cause the target (and any creature occupying the same square as the target) to become dazzled. Furthermore, each round, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become sickened by the smoke. Targets with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on their Fortitude saves. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to the sickening effect. The skull and smoke dissipate in 5 rounds.

If an attack roll made to throw a scourge vial fails, the vial is treated as a splash weapon to determine where it lands instead. If there is creature of size Large or smaller in the resulting square, make a touch attack against that target. If that attack misses, or there is no valid target in that square, the skull shrieks harmlessly before dissipating.
