Auspice

Auspices were born with a birthmark or other feature that seems to be in the shape of their master's deity's holy symbol; they are usually animal sacred to that deity's religion.

Aligned (Ex): Even though an auspice is an animal, its connection to its associated deity allows it to be chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, or neutral good, whichever is closest to the deity's alignment, or it can remain true neutral.

Auspicious Boon (Sp, Su): At 1st level, the auspice can cast guidance as a spell-like ability at will as a full-round action. At 3rd level, the auspice can access a spark of its associated deity's favor. Choose one of that deity's domains that grants a 1st-level domain power usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + the user's Wisdom modifier. The auspice can use that power once per day.

This replaces share spells and evasion.

Aligned Strike (Ex): At 15th level, an auspice's attacks count as chaotic, evil, good, or lawful (whichever matches its alignment) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction, unless the auspice is true neutral.

This replaces improved evasion.
