Description

When applied to a creature's skin, scales, or carapace, this greasy unguent causes that creature to sweat poison from its pores. During this time, a creature that strikes the user with a natural weapon attack or unarmed strike is exposed to the poison. As a swift action, the user can apply the poison to a weapon. As a standard action, the user can deliver the poison as a touch attack. The salve creates a total of 3 doses of venomsweat poison, and any unused doses of poison harmlessly evaporate after 1 hour.

Venomsweat: Contact or injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save.
