Description

This slender silver bracelet is worked in an intertwined design
of three flowers. A DC 20 Knowledge (nature) check identifies
the flowers as acacia, apocynum, and bilberry, symbolizing
concealment, treachery, and falsehood.


The bracelet grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on
Sense Motive checks, and a +5 resistance bonus on Will saves against enchantment effects. If the wearer makes a successful
Will save against an enchantment, the caster of that spell
incorrectly senses the effect has succeeded. Additionally, the
bracelet's wearer knows an enchantment targeted him and
the enchantment's source. Seducer's bane creates an aura
on its wearer, visible to detect magic, matching the failed
enchantment spell or effect, and lasting as long as the intended
enchantment's duration. However, if the bracelet's wearer
attacks the caster or its allies, or otherwise acts in a way that's
contradictory to the failed spell's effect, the caster of that spell
immediately realizes the enchantment was ineffective.
