Stone-Handed (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9qyb?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Elemental-Masters-Handbook">Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 10</a>
Drawing upon techniques to combat animated creatures, you bring a strike like an avalanche of stone.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay7b82.html?ItemName=Stunning%20Fist">Stunning Fist.</a>

Benefit: Before making a melee attack with an unarmed strike, you can expend one use of Stunning Fist to declare a stone-handed strike. Resolve the attack normally, except your attack ignores an amount of the target's hardness equal to your monk level or one-quarter your base attack bonus (minimum 1), whichever is higher. This effect replaces other effects or conditions that would be caused by your Stunning Fist.
