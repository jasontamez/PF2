Description

This special ability can only be placed on firearms. A greater reliable firearm is enchanted so as to be less likely to jam than other firearms. The greater reliable special ability reduces the misfire value of the affected firearm by 4 (minimum 0). This reduction occurs after any increases are calculated for firing with the broken condition, or for any other effect that might increase the misfire value of a firearm. A firearm with the greater reliable special ability cannot have the reliable special ability.
