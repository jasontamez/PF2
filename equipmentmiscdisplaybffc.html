Description

This eldritch chart describes part of the unfathomably vast shape of the physical universe and the subtler motions of the stars. A cosmogram grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Knowledge (geography) checks relating to stars and on Survival checks to navigate the void of space between star systems. A cosmogram can be consulted while using an orrery (see below) as a focus for augury. Doing so increases the chance of a successful reading by 2%.
