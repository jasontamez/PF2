Some companions have uncanny speed, providing their masters with swift transport.

Racer Feats: In addition to the standard feats available to animal companions, a racer can select Acrobatic Steps, Charge Through, Improved Lightning Reflexes, Lightning Stance, Nimble Moves, and Wind Stance.

Fast Movement (Ex): A racer's speed is 10 feet greater than that of typical animals of its kind when it is wearing no armor and carrying a light load.

This replaces share spells.

Sprint (Ex): At 6th level, once per hour a racer can move at 10 times its normal speed when it makes a charge or uses the run action.

This replaces devotion.
