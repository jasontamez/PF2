Description

Most desalination equipment is rare, slow, and energy-intensive enough that magic is the preferred method for turning salt water into fresh drinking water. The power provided by this device's heatstones accelerates the desalination process considerably. The user of a heatstone desalinator can place 1 gallon of salt water into the device and receive a gallon of fresh water in 1 minute, with no additional effort required on her own part.
