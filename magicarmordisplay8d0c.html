Description

These +2 armored coats are traditionally worn by the Aldori swordlords of Brevoy. The wearer of this armor gains a +2 enhancement bonus on initiative checks and a +2 circumstance bonus on attacks of opportunity if the attacks are made with an Aldori dueling sword. Once per day when the wearer of Aldori dueling armor is the target of a melee attack, she can make an attack with an Aldori dueling sword as an immediate action. If the result of her attack roll is higher than that of her attacker, the wearer of Aldori dueling armor parries the attack and takes no damage.
