Prerequisite foxfire or positive blast
Associated Blasts blue flame, fire, positive
Saving Throw Will partial
Your blast leaves behind flickering flames that reveal the target's location as per faerie fire for 1 minute (or until your next turn if the target succeeds at its save). This effect occurs even if the foe doesn't take damage, as long as the attack overcomes spell resistance (if any). You can reduce the blast's damage by half to increase the DC of this saving throw by 2. A creature can remove the revealing flames early by taking a full-round action to extinguish them.
