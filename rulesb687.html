This simple, nondescript business uses an innocuous front to hide criminal dealings. It might appear to be a low-quality pawnshop or ill-stocked market. It has the bare necessities for functioning as the kind of business it pretends to be, but its true purpose is to conceal the nature of the building-typically a criminal enterprise or secret meeting place, such as a cult's sanctuary or a den of thieves. The room includes a secret door leading to the rest of the building. The room increases Perception and Sense Motive DCs by 5 for those trying to notice unusual activity or determine whether the building is what it seems.

If you want to use your trophies to decorate another room instead of placing them in their own room, construct the Furnishings augmentation instead.

Benefit Decreased chance of fired arrows being destroyed or lost
Create 12 Goods, 12 Labor (480 gp); Time 25 days
Size 20-50 squares

An Archery Range is an open area where one can train with ranged weapons. One end of the range features targets and a soft wall (often several feet of stacked hay or loose earth) to absorb missed shots, while the other side has benches, tables, and firing stands to accommodate trainees. Because the targets and soft wall behind them are designed to absorb ranged attacks, arrows that strike either surface have only a 5% chance of being destroyed or lost.

Benefit Perception check required to see through
Create 3 Goods, 2 Influence, 3 Labor (180 gp); Time 10 days

Between 10 and 15 feet high, a Blind helps to conceal any structures behind it as it blends in with the nearby landscape.

One Blind can cover 20 squares' worth of structures; multiple Blinds can be used to conceal larger structures. A Blind can be thickened for double the construction cost, increasing the DC of the Perception check to see through the Blind to 20 and granting total concealment to creatures hiding behind it.

Size 10-20 squares
Upgrades From Greenhouse

A Mystic Greenhouse has been specially modified to accommodate both the mundane and magical needs of supernatural plants and creatures of the plant type, making them easier to work with.

After a full day of exposure to the Mystical Greenhouse's beneficial effects, creatures within become relaxed and compliant. Other creatures gain a +2 bonus on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks against creatures that have spent the past 24 hours in a Mystic Greenhouse.



Rangelands

Earnings gp or Goods +15
Create 100 Goods (2,000 gp); Time 365 days
Size 300-500 squares

Rangelands are vast, unfenced areas of natural terrain that can be used to run large herds of cattle such as aurochs, horses, and sheep. While Rangelands can produce a significant profit, they involve a major investment of time and effort to maintain long enough for the herd to produce new livestock, as well as for livestock born in previous years to grow enough to be butchered, sheared, or otherwise harvested. Rangelands are different from pastures or farmlands in that they contain only native, local plant life, rather than crops placed to make them more effective grazing lands. Small communities often depend on Rangelands as their primary sources of income, and it is not uncommon for tribes to go to war over control of local Rangelands.



Reservoir System

Earnings gp, Influence, or Labor +10
Create 10 Goods, 10 Labor (400 gp); Time 40 days
Size 25-50 squares (though individual pools can be smaller)

A Reservoir System is a series of interconnected pools or tanks meant to collect and hold water from rains, springs, and other natural sources to act as a resource for plumbing networks or a source of water during times of drought. The pools are sealed to minimize water loss from evaporation and absorption into the surrounding ground, so the Reservoir System can be relied on throughout an entire dry season.



Watering Hole

Earnings gp, Goods, or Influence +8
Create 10 Goods, 3 Influence, 5 Labor (200 gp); Time 25 days
Size 30-50 squares

A Watering Hole provides bathing and drinking water for animals and traveling caravans. In addition to the pool of water itself, the Watering Hole also provides open space around it where animals can gather and rest. The pool can be a modified natural pond or spring, or it may be an artificially constructed pool that maximizes shore space around which animals can gather. Watering Holes often attract predators, which must be driven off or killed.

Augmentations modify a room to be more productive, durable, or useful. Augmentations are permanent and can't be removed. If you upgrade a room you have augmented, the augmentation carries over to the upgrade, but the augmentation's cost isn't considered when you look at the difference between the base and upgrade room. You can put more than one augmentation in a room, as long as they aren't the same augmentation.



Fortification (Augmentation)


Benefit increases room's durability
Create 8 Goods, 7 Labor (300 gp); Time 30 days
Size As original room

This upgrade can be applied to any room, reinforcing walls, improving doors, and treating or replacing flammable materials. Upon buying this upgrade, the room's walls have their hardness increased by +2, the doors are improved to strong wooden doors (hardness 5, hit points 20), and walls and floors gain fire resistance 5. This upgrade doesn't affect items within the room (for example, upgrading a Book Repository affects the structure, not the books within it).



Furnishings (Augmentation)


Earnings +5 on the room's check to generate capital
Create 9 Goods, 6 Labor (300 gp); Time 20 days
Size as original room

This upgrade adds fancy furnishings to one room, such as wooden paneling, marble floors, fine ceramic teacups, lifelike paintings, and canopies for beds. The decoration is appropriate to the nature of the room and building. For example, if applied to a Bar frequented by soldiers, it includes patriotic heraldry and placards memorializing war heroes.



Trap (Augmentation)



Adding a Trap augmentation to a room costs the same as adding a dedicated Trap room; see the Trap room.

Arboreal (Augmentation)

Earnings Influence +2
Benefit Room is raised above ground
Create 6 Goods, 2 Influence, 6 Labor (300 gp); Time 15 days
Size As original room +9 spaces

This augmentation integrates a room into a large, sturdy tree or trees, raising the structure off the ground by one or two stories and wrapping the habitable space in or around the tree trunks. Usually, a room with this augmentation will have branches weaving through the room as the tree grows.



Attuned (Augmentation)


Benefit Allows the room to be affected by certain nature-related spells
Create 5 Goods, 5 Labor, 3 Magic (500 gp); Time 20 days
Size As original room

This augmentation integrates a room into the surrounding natural environment, putting the space into symbiosis with the local ecosystems. An Attuned room in a forest can be built amid great trees that act as some of the primary walls, while an Attuned room in a desert might be built to help foster the growth of desert plants. Once this augmentation is completed, the room is considered to be representative of the local flora for purposes of spells such as <a href="spelldisplaye879.html?ItemName=entangle">entangle</a> or <a href="spelldisplay1670.html?ItemName=spike%20growth">spike growth</a>.

Master architects across the Inner Sea region and beyond use the following building materials to protect against thieves and spies as well as invaders.

Dead-Magic Wall: Dead-magic walls incorporate cold iron runes that negate all magic passing through, as described in the spell <a href="spelldisplay8db6.html?ItemName=antimagic%20field">antimagic field</a>. If a room is enclosed on all sides (including the ceiling and floor) by dead-magic walls, the area within functions as an antimagic field. Creating a dead-magic wall requires the spell antimagic field, the expenditure of 3,000 gp for each 5-foot-wide-by-10-foot-tall section of wall, and the creator to have the <a href="featdisplay7f69.html?ItemName=Craft%20Wondrous%20Item">Craft Wondrous Item</a> feat.

Lead-Lined Walls: Lead-lined walls block nearly all divinations from passing through, but are ineffective as long as any door is open so much as a crack. Detection and location magic generally is blocked as long as there is an unbroken lead barrier directly between the caster and the protected creature or object, but scrying effects, <a href="spelldisplay5dd5.html?ItemName=discern%20location">discern location</a>, and other spells that aren't limited to straight lines of effect are blocked only if the protected creature or object is seamlessly enclosed by lead-lined walls. Because of this and the fact that they are rumored to cause insanity in anyone who dwells within long enough, these walls are rarely used in any structures other than vaults and panic rooms. The price includes adding lead lining to any doors, shutters, and other openings into the room so that the lead seal is complete when they are closed. A room sealed fast against divination from all directions by lead is also airtight, potentially suffocating anyone trapped inside. A lead-lined wall costs an extra 250 gp for each 5-foot-wideby- 10-foot-tall section of wall. This augmentation cannot be applied to paper walls.

Secrecy Runes: Magically reinforced walls can incorporate secrecy runes to prevent magic from allowing someone to see within. Sounds cannot pass out of an area enclosed by secrecy runes on all sides (including ceilings and floors), as long as all exits are closed. In addition, the runes block divinations of or below a specified spell level (as indicated on the table below) from entering an area enclosed by secrecy runes on all sides (including ceilings and floors), even while portals to the area are open. See the table below for prices and the maximum level of spells each type of runes can block. Creating secrecy runes requires the <a href="featdisplay7f69.html?ItemName=Craft%20Wondrous%20Item">Craft Wondrous Item</a> feat, the spell <a href="spelldisplayd4a6.html?ItemName=mage's%20private%20sanctum">mage's private sanctum</a>, and the expenditure of the listed amount of gold for each 5-foot-by-10-foot section of wall.
