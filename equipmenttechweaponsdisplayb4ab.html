Description

This weapon uses a sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency blasts of energy that pummel targets. The weapon has a relatively short range, but the fact that it deals nonlethal damage at range and can knock targets prone makes it a favorite for those seeking to capture their foes alive. A hit by a stun gun deals nonlethal damage-on a critical hit, the gun can attempt a free trip combat maneuver check against the target (CMB = user's base attack bonus + 10); this attempt doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
