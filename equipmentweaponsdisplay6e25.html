Description

Used in Avistan since before Earthfall, seaxes are straight, single-edged blades. The broken-back seax is the size of a short sword, and has a broad blade with a distinctive trapezoidal shape. If your Strength score is less than 15, you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with a broken-back seax, as you're unable to put enough force into the blows to land them effectively.
