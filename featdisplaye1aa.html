Split Major Hex

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy8k8r">Ultimate Magic pg. 156</a>
You can split the effect of one of your targeted hexes, affecting another creature you can see.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay40d4.html?ItemName=Split%20Hex">Split hex</a>, caster level 18th.

Benefit:  When you use one of your major hexes (not a grand hex) that targets a creature, you can choose another creature within 30 feet of the first target to also be targeted by the major hex.
