Your summoned minions shine with the power of the sun.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay08ea.html?ItemName=Spell%20Focus">Spell Focus (conjuration)</a>, able to cast summon nature's ally.

Benefit:  Creatures that you summon shed light as a light spell. They are immune to blinding or dazzling effects, and their natural weapons are treated as magical for overcoming damage reduction.
