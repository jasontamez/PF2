Description

The gold standard of coffee in Ular Kel, Karazhica is notable for its acidity and smooth flavor. By drinking two cups of Karazhica coffee, you can walk for an additional hour before you must make a forced march. This additional hour counts as an hour of marching beyond the maximum for the purpose of determining the DC of Constitution checks for a subsequent forced march. You can benefit from Karazhica coffee only once per day.
