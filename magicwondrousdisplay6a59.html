Description

This simple white candle gives off a pleasing aroma of moonflowers. Any creature within 10 feet of the candle's flame begins to feel drowsy, gradually growing sleepier. Every 10 minutes, each such creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or fall into a normal sleep. On each check after the first, a creature takes a cumulative -2 penalty. Even with a successful saving throw, a creature is not aware that it succeeded at its saving throw, though it can potentially deduce the presence of a soporific effect-for instance, if its allies start falling asleep.

Extinguishing the flame ends the magical effect but does not wake sleeping creatures. The candle can burn for a total of 3 hours; this duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-hour increments. Once all 3 hours are used, the candle is destroyed.
