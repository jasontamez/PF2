Your blasphemies shatter divine magic.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay1c9f.html?ItemName=Asura%20Sight">Asura Sight</a>, <a href="featdisplay4cc3.html?ItemName=Asura%20Style">Asura Style</a>, base attack bonus +13 or monk level 13th.

Benefit: You can replace one of your attacks at your highest base attack bonus each round with a spellrending strike. If your spellrending strike hits, it deals no damage, but you can attempt to dispel a harmless divine spell affecting this target as per <a href="spelldisplay5e43.html?ItemName=dispel%20magic">dispel magic</a>, with a caster level equal to your character level. If you succeed at your dispel check, the target is sickened as if you had interrupted the spell with <a href="featdisplay4cc3.html?ItemName=Asura%20Style">Asura Style</a> and receives no saving throw to reduce the sickened duration.
