Description

Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of this +2 do-maru armor (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 128) can activate the armor to heal 4d8+9 points of damage and end any and all of the following conditions affecting the wearer: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, and sickened. In addition, this effect functions as break enchantment upon a single additional effect of the wearer's choice that is affecting the wearer and that can be legally affected by this effect. Such healing, however, comes at a cost. The do-maru of broken flesh creates vivid, ugly scars on the wearer, who takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each time this ability is used.

Do-maru is medium armor that provides a +5 armor bonus. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor check penalty of -4. Do-maru costs 200 gp and weighs 30 lbs.
