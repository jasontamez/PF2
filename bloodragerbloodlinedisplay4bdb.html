Sphinx Bloodline

Those who successfully traded riddles with sphinxes sometimes find themselves or their descendants exhibiting both arcane power and violent fury. These bloodragers find being outwitted or outmaneuvered especially infuriating; though they are usually scholarly and erudite, their fits of frenzied rage are all the more terrifying in comparison.

Bloodline Powers: You gain the ruthless claws and implacable voice of the sphinx while bloodraging.

Claws (Su): At 1st level, you grow claws while bloodraging. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack, using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d6 points of damage each (1d4 if you are Small) plus your Strength modifier. At 4th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 8th level, the damage increases to 1d8 points (1d6 if you are Small). At 12th level, the critical threat range for these claws increases to 19-20.

Roar (Su): At 4th level, the bloodrager learns the secrets of the sphinx's roar. He can roar as a standard action a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Enemies within 60 feet of the bloodrager that can hear the roar must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the bloodrager's character level + his Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1d6 rounds. At 10th level, the bloodrager can instead cause the targets to be panicked or stunned (bloodrager's choice) and deafened for the duration; at 16th level, the bloodrager can instead cause the targets to be paralyzed for 1 round. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the bloodrager's roar again for 24 hours.

Desert Fortitude (Su): At 8th level, you gain resistance 5 to electricity and fire. In addition, you gain endure elements as a constant spell-like ability and a +2 competence bonus on saves against arcane spells. At 16th level, your resistance to electricity and fire increases to 10.

Rending Rage (Su): At 12th level, you gain a <a href="umr6a05.html?ItemName=Rend">rend</a> attack, as the universal monster rule, that deals extra damage equal to 2d4 + 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. At 18th level, this damage increases to 2d6 + 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier.

Master of Mysteries (Su): At 16th level, you can cast either <a href="spelldisplay9665.html?ItemName=">maze</a> or <a href="spelldisplay4931.html?ItemName=symbol%20of%20insanity">symbol of insanity</a> once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to your character level. You also gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your level.

Final Riddle (Su): At 20th level, you gain immunity to fire and electricity and ignore environmental penalties due to temperature. Your competence bonus on saving throws against arcane spells increases to +6. You have these benefits constantly, even while not raging.
