Description

Legend tells that the first suits of empyreal armor were forged
from the battered, cast-off breastplates worn by solars in battle.
These suits were gifted to powerful mortal heroes and have
since changed hands many times.

Empyreal armor is made of steel forged so that it reflects a
golden sheen in the sunlight. This armor functions as a suit of
+3 moderate fortification full plate. In addition, three times per
day, its wearer can activate a fire shield (warm shield only) that
lasts for 13 rounds. Any creature attacking the wearer with its
body or a handheld weapon while the fire shield effect is active
deals normal damage but takes 1d6+13 points of damage in
return. Half this damage is fire damage, but the other half
results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject
to energy resistance.
