Benefit: This animal can bull rush a target that is up to two size categories larger than itself. If it pushes the target at least 10 feet as a result of this bull rush, it can attempt a trip combat maneuver check against the target as a free action. This trip combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.
