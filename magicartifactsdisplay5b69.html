Description

The Shard of Wrath is made of sparkling silver siccatite that feels hot one day, but cold the next. As long as the Shard of Wrath is carried, its owner can use fireball as a spell-like ability once per day, gains a +2 insight bonus on saves versus evocation spells, and gains a +2 insight bonus on all weapon damage rolls.

Curse: The owner becomes addicted to violence, and is sickened whenever she hasn't brought a living creature to -1 hit points or fewer within the last hour. Once the owner attacks a creature, she must make a DC 20 Will save if she wants to cease attacking; otherwise, she does what she can to kill the creature.

Destruction

A shard of the Sihedron cannot be destroyed individually. Only by recombining them into the Sihedron and then using that artifact's method of destruction can one destroy the shards.
