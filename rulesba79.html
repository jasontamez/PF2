Public burning tops the list of preferred ways to dispose of witches, heretics, and undesirables of all sorts.

By the Rules: This is a simple matter of reskinning an existing rules set: being burned at the stake rather than being trapped in a <a href="rules9ff7.html?Name=Forest%20Fires%20(CR%206)&amp;Category=Forest%20Terrain">forest fire</a>. With rules for heat damage, catching fire, and-most realistically- smoke inhalation, the forest fire rules can be combined with the <a href="rules6d98.html?Name=Grapple&amp;Category=Combat%20Maneuvers">grapple rules for tying someone up</a> to provide everything necessary for binding a character to a stake and lighting the roaring flames.

Extrapolation: Binding a character to a stake-and setting a DC to escape said bindings-can be covered by the tie-up options detailed in the grapple combat maneuver. Once the character is bound, likely amid heaps of unlit kindling, the process of starting the fire is relatively simple. Given dry conditions and a ready flame, a GM might rule that it takes 1 minute to get the fire burning to a point that smoke inhalation becomes a threat to a bound victim. After some initial encouragement, the fire takes over; after 1 minute, the victim begins taking 1d6 points of fire damage every round while facing additional Fortitude saving throws as detailed in the heat damage portion of the forest fire rules. Finally, 1 minute later and every minute after that, the victim must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or catch fire, as per the <a href="rulesb1a4.html?Name=Catching%20on%20Fire&amp;Category=Heat%20Dangers">catching fire rules</a>. Characters still bound to the stake take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.

Horror Considerations: Don't trust a burning wooden post in an open square to hold every heretic. Cages and magical paralysis are more effective at restraining victims, while illusions can lure unfortunates into traps. Placing the stake at the top of a spire or the bottom of a pit also makes access and escape more challenging and could extend the threat of smoke hazards.
