Eidolon (Unchained) Base Forms


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained">Pathfinder Unchained</a>
Each eidolon has one of three base forms that determines its starting size, speed, AC, attacks, and ability scores. All natural attacks are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted (such as in the case of secondary attacks). An eidolon's attacks add the eidolon's Strength modifier to the damage rolls, unless the eidolon has only one attack, in which case the attack adds 1-1/2 times the eidolon's Strength modifier.

Alternatively, any one of these base forms can be used to make a Small eidolon. If the eidolon is Small, it gains a +2 bonus to Dexterity. It takes a -4 penalty to Strength and a -2 penalty to Constitution. It also has a +1 size bonus to AC and on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a +2 bonus on Fly checks, and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks. Reduce the damage of all of its attacks by one step (for example, 1d6 becomes 1d4, and 1d4 becomes 1d3). If this choice is made, the eidolon can be made Medium whenever the summoner can change the eidolon's evolution pool (which causes it to lose these modifiers for being Small). Likewise, a Medium eidolon can be made Small whenever the summoner can change the eidolon's evolution pool.
