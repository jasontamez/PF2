You have trained to use the net as a melee weapon.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net)</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  You can treat a net as a one-handed melee reach weapon with a 10-foot reach. Further, you take no penalty on melee attack rolls for using an unfolded net, and you can use one full-round action or two move actions to fold a net.

Normal:  A net is a ranged weapon that imposes a -4 penalty on ranged attack rolls if it is unfolded. Folding a net takes a proficient user 2 rounds.
