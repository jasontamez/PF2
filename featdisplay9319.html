You draw upon the power of an allied arcane spellcaster to enhance your weapons with magical energy.

Benefit: Three times per day as a swift action, when you are within 30 feet of an ally who is an arcane spellcaster, you can channel a portion of her arcane power into your weapons. For 1 round, you gain a +1 bonus on all weapon damage rolls, and your weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. When your base attack bonus reaches +4 and every 4 points thereafter, this bonus increases by 1, to a maximum of +5 at 16th level.

Special: This feat counts as Arcane Strike for the purposes of prerequisites.
