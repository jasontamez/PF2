Description

This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When
played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind
instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding
tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed at
a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures
with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. Pipes of haunting can
be sounded twice a day.
