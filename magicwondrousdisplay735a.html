Description

Ointment of void sealing comes in a 4-gallon tub, typically made out of brass or some other durable metal. When a Medium or smaller character dunks his head into the tub of sticky, viscous goo as a standard action, the ointment flows over and around him with surprising alacrity until it has coated him in a thin but flexible layer that looks like translucent amber. Ointment of void sealing creates a perfect seal around the user, protecting him from the extreme cold and vacuum of outer space, and provides breathable air for the user, as planetary adaptation (see page 28). After 3 hours, a coating of ointment of void sealing deteriorates and its effects end. A newly created tub of ointment of void sealing contains enough ointment to cover four Medium creatures. Large creatures require 2 doses to gain the benefits of the ointment, while two Small creatures can share a single dose between them.
