Description

This variant sunrod was developed by fetchling alchemists. When twisted as a standard action, a gloomstick begins drawing in light from the surrounding area, reducing the light level by one step (to a minimum of dim light) in a 20-foot radius. A gloomstick remains active for 1 minute before crumbling to dust.
