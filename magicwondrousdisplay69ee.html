Description

This device appears to be a normal
container for holding burning coals.
The brazier must be filled with coals or
wood and a fire lit within it to function.
On command as a full-round action, the
bearer may summon a fire elemental. If 1 pound of brimstone
(sulfur) is burning in the brazier, it conjures a Huge fire elemental
as if using summon monster VI. Otherwise, the brazier conjures
a Large fire elemental as if using summon monster V. Conjuring
an elemental extinguishes the fire in the brazier. The brazier
cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is
dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.
