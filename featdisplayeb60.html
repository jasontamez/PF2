Escaping death strengthened your bond to life, but fills
you with a need for answers.

Prerequisites: You must have been slain and brought
back from the dead, or have the Left to Die or Cursed
Birth background.

Benefit: You don't die until your negative hit point
total is equal to or greater than 4 + your Constitution
score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force
yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining
1 temporary hit point per hit die. These temporary hit
points last for 10 minutes.

Normal: You die when your negative hit point total is
equal to or greater than your Constitution score.


Goal: You meet in person and hear the words of your
deity or your deity's chosen herald. If you worship a
pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of
that pantheon-a herald does not suffice in this case. If
you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of
an appropriate entity of the GM's choice.

Completion Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving
throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition,
the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is
cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects
on you alone.
