Black powder and firearms are a natural extension of the alchemical experimentation that investigators use on a regular basis. Steel hounds are investigators who have taken to using firearms in place of the more mundane weapons their counterparts favor.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency:  Steel hounds are proficient with simple weapons, plus the rapier, the sap, and one type of firearm selected at 1st level. They are prof icient in light armor, but not shields. This replaces the investigator's weapon and armor proficiencies.

Packing Heat (Ex): At 2nd level, the steel hound gains both the Amateur Gunslinger and Gunsmithing feats as bonus feats. He also gains a battered gun identical to the one gained by the gunslinger. This ability replaces poison lore.

Investigator Talents:  The steel hound can select the Extra Grit or Rapid Reload feats in place of an investigator talent.

Shot in the Dark (Ex):  At 4th level, a steel hound gains the following deed. This deed works and interacts with grit the same way as gunslinger deeds, but only the steel hound can use it. If the steel hound also has levels in gunslinger, he can spend grit points from that class to use this deed.

Blind Shot (Su): A steel hound can spend 1 grit point to ignore all miss chances due to concealment when making firearm attacks. This effect lasts until the end of his turn. This ability allows the steel hound to ignore concealment, but does not reveal or allow him to see the enemy. This ability replaces swift alchemy.

Talented Shot (Ex):  At 11th level, a steel hound can select a gunslinger deed in place of an investigator talent. He can select from any deed available to a gunslinger of his investigator level - 4.
