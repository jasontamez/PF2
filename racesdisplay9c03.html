Half-Orcs

As seen by civilized races, half-orcs are monstrosities, the result of perversion and violence-whether or not this is actually true. Half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for themselves. Half-orcs as a whole resent this treatment, and rather than play the part of the victim, they tend to lash out, unknowingly confirming the biases of those around them. A few feared, distrusted, and spat-upon half-orcs manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom-though sometimes it's easier just to crack a few skulls. Some half-orcs spend their entire lives proving to full-blooded orcs that they are just as fierce. Others opt for trying to blend into human society, constantly demonstrating that they aren't monsters. Their need to always prove themselves worthy encourages half-orcs to strive for power and greatness within the society around them. ??

Physical Description: Half-orcs average around 6 feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these "tusks," combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful. Despite these obvious orc traits, half-orcs are as varied as their human parents. ??

Society: Unlike half-elves, where at least part of society's discrimination is born out of jealousy or attraction, half-orcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than their orc kin, they also tend to be feared or attacked outright by humans who don't bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods. Even on the best of terms, half-orcs in civilized societies are not exactly accepted, and tend to be valued only for their physical abilities. On the other hand, orc leaders have been known to deliberately spawn half-orcs, as the halfbreeds make up for their lack of physical strength with increased cunning and aggression, making them natural leaders and strategic advisors. ??

Within orc tribes, half-orcs find themselves constantly striving to prove their worth in battle and with feats of strength. Half-orcs raised within orc tribes are more likely to file their tusks and cover themselves in tribal tattoos. Tribal leaders quietly recognize that half-orcs are often more clever than their orc cousins and often apprentice them to the tribe's shaman, where their cunning might eventually strengthen the tribe. Apprenticeship to a shaman is a brutal and often short-lived distinction, however, and those half-orcs who survive it either become influential in the tribe or are eventually driven to leave. ??

Half-orcs have a much more mixed experience in human society, where many cultures view them as little more than monsters. They often are unable even to get normal work, and are pressed into service in the military or sold into slavery. In these cultures, half-orcs often lead furtive lives, hiding their nature whenever possible. The dark underworld of society is often the most welcoming place, and many half-orcs wind up serving as enforcers for thieves guilds or other types of organized crime. ??

Less commonly, human cities may allow half-orcs a more normal existence, even enabling them to develop small communities of their own. These communities are usually centered around the arena districts, the military, or mercenary organizations where their brute strength is valued and their appearance is more likely to be overlooked. Even surrounded by their own kind, half-orc life isn't easy. Bullying and physical confrontation comes easy to a people who have been raised with few other examples of behavior. It is, however, one of the best places for young half-orcs to grow up without prejudice, and these small enclaves are one of the few places where half-orc marriages and children are truly accepted and sometimes cherished. ??

Even more rarely, certain human cultures come to embrace half-orcs for their strength. There are stories of places where people see half-orc children as a blessing and seek out half-orc or orc lovers. In these cultures, half-orcs lead lives not much different from full-blooded humans. ??

Relations: Elves and dwarves tend to be the least accepting of half-orcs, seeing in them too great a resemblance to their racial enemies, and other races aren't much more understanding. ??

A lifetime of persecution leaves the average half-orc wary and quick to anger, yet people who break through his savage exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy. Human societies with few orc problems tend to be the most accommodating, and half-orcs dwelling there can often find work as mercenaries and enforcers. Even in places where there is a general tolerance for half-orcs, however, many humans mistreat them when they can get away with it. ??

Half-orcs are envious of the measure of acceptance half-elves have within human and elven society and resent their physical beauty, which contrasts starkly to the half-orcs' brutish appearance. While half-orcs avoid antagonizing their half-breed cousins directly, they won't hesitate to undermine them if the opportunity presents itself. ??

Of all the other races, half-orcs are most sympathetic with halflings, who often have an equally rough lot in life. Half-orcs respect the halfling's ability to blend in and disappear and admire their perpetually cheerful outlook on life in spite of hardships. Halflings fail to appreciate this fact because they usually are too busy avoiding the large, intimidating half-orcs. ??

Alignment and Religion: Forced to live either among brutish orcs or as lonely outcasts in civilized lands, most half-orcs are bitter, violent, and reclusive. Evil comes easily to them, but they are not evil by nature-rather, most half-orcs are chaotic neutral, having been taught by long experience that there's no point doing anything but that which directly benefits themselves. Half-orcs worship the human or orc gods venerated in the area where they were raised. Those who live alongside humans most often worship human gods of war, freedom, or destruction. Half-orcs raised in orc tribes find themselves most drawn to the gods of blood, fire, and iron-depending more on what god the tribe worships rather than the half-orcs' personal preference. Many half-orcs are contrary about religion, either ignoring it entirely, or getting deeply involved in it and trying to find meaning in a life filled with hate and misunderstanding; even a half-orc divine spellcaster may wrestle with doubt and anger about religion and faith. ??

Adventurers: Staunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot through force of arms. Others, more optimistic or desperate for acceptance, take up the mantle of crusaders in order to prove their worth to the world. ??

Half-orcs raised in orc societies often take up the brutish ways of those around them, becoming fighters, barbarians, or rangers. Half-orcs who survive their shaman training may eventually succeed their masters as tribal shamans, or flee the tribe and practice their magic as outcasts or explorers. ??

Half-orcs are just as likely to have children that possess an innate talent for sorcery as any other race, with the abyssal, destined, and elemental fire bloodlines being the most common types of sorcerers. Half-orcs are fascinated by alchemy, and its destructive capabilities make its usefulness obvious in any orc tribe. Half-orc alchemists treat themselves as living experiments, even to the point of trying to separate their orc and human halves through alchemy. Other alchemists use their powers to enhance their physical abilities and thus increase their status within orc communities. ??

In human societies, half-orcs have a few more options. Many find it easy to take advantage of the brute strength and work as mercenaries or caravan guards. Crime is another easy route for half-orcs, as there are plenty of criminals looking for a strong arm. Half-orc clerics in human communities are fairly rare; the more religious half-orcs more often turn to (or get pushed to) the martial aspects of religious service and become paladins or inquisitors. Half-orcs usually lack the patience and money required to become a wizard. ??

Subraces



Arena-Bred

Many half-orcs are born and raised to fight in the arena, and in many cases have two half-orc parents or even a half-orc and a human parent. These arena-bred half-orcs lose the brutal physical appearance of their orc ancestors and look more human. They have the city-raised and skilled alternate racial traits.



Darklands Half-Orcs (Gloomkin)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 24</a>, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy93na?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Bastards-of-Golarion">Bastards of Golarion pg. 11</a>
At the end of the Age of Darkness, when light returned to Golarion, many orcs lost their footholds on the surface world and returned to the Darklands, taking their half-orc progeny with them. Of all the half-orcs, gloomkin face the harshest treatment; they are punished and abused from birth for what orcs consider the taint of their bloodline. As the bottom of the social ladder in orc society, gloomkin are assigned the task that very few orcs take on willingly: reading. They are the historians, scribes, and advisors, placing them in a key position to discover secrets and gain influence without drawing attention to themselves.



Deep Kin

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 52</a>
Some half-orcs are descended from clans that remained in the eternal darkness below the surface. Half-orcs from these clans tend to be smaller and more at home underground than those descended from surface-dwelling orcs. These half-orcs have the acute darkvision and cavewight alternate racial traits.



Desert Half-Orcs (Sandkin)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 25</a>, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy93na?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Bastards-of-Golarion">Bastards of Golarion pg. 12</a>
Desert half-orcs are born primarily in northern Garund and Osirion and often hold a level of esteem and self-assurance that is rare for half-orcs. Among desert orc tribes, the ability to tolerate harsh sunlight is a sign of strength, and weathering the sun is a rite of passage. Lacking their ancestors' light sensitivity, half-orcs excel at these contests of endurance and easily earn high positions within their tribes.

Desert half-orcs also fare better than most among human civilizations. The strong presence of Sarenrae's followers has led to a culture of forgiveness and understanding that is rare in other parts of Golarion, making it easier for half-orcs to thrive. Many desert half-orcs believe they are blessed by Sarenrae and become clerics or paladins of her church.



Feral

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 53</a>
Half-orc children who are abandoned as infants or small children rarely survive in the wild, but a few manage to scrape out a meager existence as "wild children," tough enough to live but completely uncivilized. Feral half-orcs have the forest walker and toothy alternate racial traits.



Jungle Half-Orcs (Rainkin)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 25</a>, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy93na?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Bastards-of-Golarion">Bastards of Golarion pg. 12</a>
In the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the few remaining orc tribes have been largely cut off from others of their kind. Isolated since the orc empires collapsed after the Age of Darkness, only a handful of oral retellings recall the true heritage of these orcs and half-orcs, and their culture diverges greatly from other orc societies. It is said that some early Mwangi tribes participated in arranged marriages with orcs, leading half-orc children to be associated with alliances and prosperity, and true or not, half-orcs have been a major part of these orc tribes for generations. Even in the present day, many orcs are willing to pay a large dowry to bring half-orcs into their villages, and orphaned half-orcs are happily adopted.

Because they usually come from rich families, rainkin halforcs often receive better treatment than their orc or human cousins. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy; because half-orc children receive the best care, protection, and training, they are usually stronger and more skilled than orcs or humans, increasing the desire to have half-orcs in a tribe. While jungle half-orcs typically have great pride and selfworth, many are also resentful of the high expectations placed on them from birth and angry to be treated like a commodity by so many. As a result, rainkin have trouble forming close bonds with non-half-orcs, so they often create close-knit groups between themselves. Some of these groups even grow large enough to break off and form their own tribes.



Mountain Clan

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 53</a>
Half-orcs from the more mountainous regions tend to be more agile and alert to the echoing sounds of their homeland. Mountain clan half-orcs have the bestial and rock climber racial traits.



Mountain Half-Orcs (Cragkin)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 25</a>, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy93na?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Bastards-of-Golarion">Bastards of Golarion pg. 13</a>
Cragkin are widespread across Golarion, found across all the mountain ranges of western Avistan. Thanks to their thin frames and quick wits, mountain-born half-orcs excel at climbing and acrobatic stunts. Anything less than a vertical cliff face is traversable, and often even that isn't enough to stop them. To mountain half-orcs, obstacles are merely a foothold on their path to the top.

Mountain orcs respect bravery, and cragkin have turned fearlessness and reckless abandon into a badge of honor. By using the terrain to their advantage against less surefooted enemies, they can attack from strange angles and gain advantages with just a few quick steps. They often take near-suicidal leaps to strike enemies from above, or trick enemies into falling to their deaths by leading them down impossible paths. Despite their great skill, accidents are common in this treacherous environment, and no one is surprised if one halforc returns after a raid and his companions do not.

Many mountain half-orcs find a place among Shoanti and Ulfen settlements, where valor in battle is highly prized. As long as they are willing to respect the traditions of their adopted clans, they usually integrate well into these societies and contribute much to the community.



Mystic

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rv2?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Advanced-Race-Guide">Advanced Race Guide pg. 53</a>
Orc shamans are brutal teachers who sometimes kill or maim their most promising students in order to eliminate what could be a potential rival. Half-orcs who survive years of abuse by an orc shaman master are deeply scarred and altered by the experience. Shaman trainees learn early that cunning and luck are often the only things that offer a chance of survival. They have the shaman's apprentice and sacred tattoo alternate racial traits.



Winter Half-Orcs (Frostkin)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9xdr?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Heroes-from-the-Fringe">Heroes from the Fringe pg. 26</a>, <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy93na?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Bastards-of-Golarion">Bastards of Golarion pg. 13</a>
At the Crown of the World, nomadic clans of orcs live on the frozen wastes. The winter half-orcs that live among them are treated as the runts of the pack. However, strength in numbers is vital in the north, as many young do not survive the harsh winters. Even the weakest are provided for as long as they can prove their usefulness. Sewing, cooking, and child-rearing are all valued skills, and winter half-orcs who excel at these are treated better than most. Those who would rather prove their worth through their strength do so by hunting, as ritual combat is a frowned upon waste of energy and resources.

While half-orcs are not well liked in the Linnorm Kingdoms, they may be able to find homes in the Ironbound Isles. Merchants traveling between Tian Xia and Avistan are often willing to hire on a half-orc as a guide and bodyguard across the Crown of the World. Winter half-orcs who migrate south into Irrisen can find an easier life in the growing half-orc communities, but they are unlikely to find any upward mobility unless they show skill at witchcraft.
