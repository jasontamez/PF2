Description

This well-made leather vest bears
numerous shiny metal buttons, which
stud a number of bulging pockets.
Once per day, as a standard action, the
wearer can speak the vest's command
word and order it to bring forth all
the standard tools required to make
checks for any one Craft skill. These
tools appear in the countless pockets
of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a nearby shelf, on
a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears nearby.
Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until another
creature touches them, whichever comes first.
