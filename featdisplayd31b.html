You are well versed in the lore of the planes and the psychology of their natives.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks and on Sense Motive checks against outsiders, and Knowledge (planes) is a class skill for you. If you have 10 or more ranks in either of these skills, the bonus for that skill increases to +4. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by the Alertness or Scholar feats.
