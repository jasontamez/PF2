You bring luck to those with whom you travel.

Prerequisites: Halfling.

Benefit:  Once per day, when one of your allies within 30 feet makes a saving throw, you may roll the same saving throw as if you were the one subject to the effect requiring it. You may use this ability after your ally has rolled, but before the GM declares if the roll was a success or failure. Your ally may choose to use your saving throw in place of his own.

You share your mythic luck with those around you.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayc063.html?ItemName=Lucky%20Halfling">Lucky Halfling.</a>

Benefit:  When you use Lucky Halfling, add your tier as a bonus on the saving throw. You can expend one use of mythic power when an ally uses your save but still suffers an effect on a successful saving throw. If you do, that ally suffers no effect on the successful saving throw.
