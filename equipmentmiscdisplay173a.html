Description

Applying this herbal salve to a bleeding wound cures 1 point of damage and prevents additional damage from bleeding for 1 hour per application. After an hour, if the bleed effect hasn't been properly treated, the injury resumes bleeding and more salve must be applied. Though blood-clotter salve can be applied successively to the same injury, applying multiple doses doesn't cure additional damage.
