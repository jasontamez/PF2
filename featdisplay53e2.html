You are trained to use long weapons in tight formations.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit:  When you wield a reach weapon with which you are proficient, allies don't provide soft cover to opponents you attack with reach.

Normal:  Attacking a target that is beyond another creature, even an ally, can result in the target having soft cover from you.
