Unyielding Ferocity (Combat)

When near the brink of death, you fight ferociously until the bitter end.

Prerequisites: Con 19, ferocity.

Benefit: When you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, if you remain conscious from your ferocity monster ability, you can make a full attack on your next turn (or your current turn if you are reduced to 0 hit points on your own turn). If you do, you push your body to the point that your mind becomes more primitive, and you can no longer use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills except Acrobatics, Fly, Intimidate, or Ride, or any ability that requires patience or concentration (such as spellcasting) until your hit points are raised above 0.

Normal: When using the ferocity ability, you are staggered while you have fewer than 0 hit points and thus can't make a full attack.
