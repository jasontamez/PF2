Block Upper Chakras

Source <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btpya0b6">Martial Arts Handbook pg. 28</a>
You can block additional chakras.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay3ad0.html?ItemName=Block%20Chakras">Block Chakras</a>, <a href="featdisplayfc3c.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Sensitivity">Psychic Sensitivity</a> or levels in an occult class, <a href="classdisplaye4f2.html?ItemName=Brawler">brawler's flurry</a> or <a href="classdisplay9dae.html?ItemName=Monk">flurry of blows class feature</a>, ki pool, character level 8th.

Benefit: When you use <a href="featdisplay3ad0.html?ItemName=Block%20Chakras">Block Chakras</a>, you can also select from the heart, throat, brow, and crown chakras, as long as you can open the chosen chakra yourself, with the following effects.

Heart: The target can't recover hit points from any source for 1 minute. This prevents hit point recovery from fast healing and regeneration but doesn't deactivate regeneration altogether, so it does not allow a creature with regeneration to be killed through hit point damage. On a successful save, the target recovers only half as many hit points for 1 round.

Throat: The target can't speak or cast spells with a thought component for 1 round, and for 1 minute, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 20% chance to fail. On a successful save, actions that require speaking or thought components have a 50% chance to fail for 1 round.

Brow: The target is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target loses all special forms of vision (such as lowlight vision, see in darkness, and true seeing) for 1 round; this doesn't affect nonvisual senses like blindsight and blindsense.

Crown: The target must roll twice and take the lower result on all d20 rolls for 1 round and on its first attack roll or caster level check each round for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target must roll twice and take the lower result on its next d20 roll.
