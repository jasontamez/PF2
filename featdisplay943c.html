You can use your ranged weapons to make melee attacks that keep foes at bay as you shoot them.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya8da.html?ItemName=Empty%20Quiver%20Flexibility">Empty Quiver Flexibility</a>, <a href="featdisplay6ecf.html?ItemName=Empty%20Quiver%20Style">Empty Quiver Style</a>, <a href="featdisplay632c.html?ItemName=Rapid%20Shot">Rapid Shot</a>, <a href="featdisplaya226.html?ItemName=Stabbing%20Shot">Stabbing Shot</a>, Weapon Focus with the chosen weapon.

Benefit:  While using Empty Quiver Style or Stabbing Shot to make melee attacks with a ranged weapon, if you successfully hit a foe, any ranged attacks you make with the same weapon until the beginning of your next turn do not provoke attacks of opportunity from that foe.

Special:  If you have the Rapid Reload feat in addition to this feat, your chosen weapon is a crossbow or firearm, that weapon is unloaded, and you successfully hit a foe in melee with it, you can automatically load it as a free action.
