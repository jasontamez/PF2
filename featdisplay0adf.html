You can empower your allies through their fear of you.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, <a href="featdisplay7726.html?ItemName=Dazzling%20Display">Dazzling Display</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus.</a>

Benefit:  Whenever you use Dazzling Display to demoralize foes, you can motivate your allies to better serve you. In addition to possibly demoralizing foes within 30 feet, your Intimidate check while using Dazzling Display also applies to allies within 30 feet who can see you. The DC for this effect is the same as it would be to demoralize your allies. Each ally so affected gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and skill checks for the duration that it would normally be shaken.
