Sometimes trolls are granted limited powers of divination by their demon god, Urxehl.

Prerequisites: Troll, patron deity Urxehl.

Benefit: You can read the future by cutting open your abdomen and pulling out your entrails. This is a full-round action that deals 6d6 points of damage to you. This functions as the divination spell, using your Hit Dice as the caster level. You can perform this ability no more than once per day.
