Tactics

Before Combat The druid drinks her potion of shield of faith.
During Combat The druid prefers to be in or near a body of water to take advantage of her abilities. She opens with her ice storm or fog cloud spells in order to slow down her opponents. Afterward, she wild shapes into either a dire bear or a giant octopus (depending on the terrain), and alternates rounds of attacks with spells such as bear's endurance and barkskin.
Base Statistics Without shield of faith, the druid's statistics are AC 22, touch 12, flat-footed 20; CMD 17.

Some druids seek the peace and tranquility that only a small island can offer and are willing to lay down their life to protect their sanctuary.

Tasseira Sprayspirit

Tasseira is one of the grim elven defenders of a far-off island that contains an ancient evil. She sees all non-elves as trespassing on her domain, and attacks them on sight. She has a very close connection to the sea, spending much of her day wild shaped into an aquatic creature. She wears an ornate wooden mask to hide her features, and loose-fitting clothes of green and blue.
