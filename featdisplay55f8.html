Sacrificing accuracy, you can inflict bloody wounds that are slow to heal.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  You can choose to take a -5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to inflict 1d4 points of bleed damage with your weapon melee attacks, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon. A creature continues to take bleed damage every round at the start of its turn. Bleed damage can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or through any magical healing. Bleed damage from this feat does not stack with itself. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn (although the bleeding lasts until healed, as normal).

Each round you use this feat, you can spend up to 5 stamina points. If you do, until the end of your next turn, you reduce the penalty on all your attack rolls by an amount equal to the number of stamina points you spent.
