Description

This crystalline carving looks like a hand-sized tree leaf. It is
usually worn around the neck on a strap so it is within easy
reach, but can be affixed to a belt or clothing just like a badge. While falling, the bearer can snap and destroy the snapleaf as an immediate action to gain the benefits of feather fall and invisibility. The duration of
the two effects work independently; ending one early does not
affect the other. The item cannot be activated to provide just one
of these two effects; they are always activated simultaneously.
