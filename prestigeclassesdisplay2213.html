Guards patrol great cities and druids protect the deep forests, but what of the boundaries between them? The hinterlands comprise the farmlands and woodland villages of Golarion, a liminal space between humanity and the wild. Some of the rugged men and women who defend these pockets of civilization are the hinterlanders. Hinterlanders are followers of Erastil who shield rural folk from dangerous creatures, extraplanar interlopers, and marauding undead. A hinterlander is skilled with a bow and in tune with the wild, yet capable of harnessing natural resources to nourish mortal communities. They are often touched by the divine, sworn to guard the borders of towns and villages against the forces that threaten to snuff out the hearth fires.

The following are the class features of the hinterlander prestige class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A hinterlander is proficient with all simple weapons, longbows, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a hinterlander chooses a favored enemy from the list below. This functions like the ranger class feature of the same name, except that the hinterlander gains an additional ability corresponding with the favored enemy chosen. Additionally, at 8th level, he can select a new favored enemy and the bonus for one such enemy increases by 2 (rather than at 5th and 10th levels).

Aberrations: The hinterlander gains a +2 bonus on all saves against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used by aberrations.

Constructs: The hinterlander's ranged attacks ignore the first 10 points of a construct's DR or hardness.

Evil Outsiders: The hinterlander's ranged attacks are treated as good weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

Magical Beasts: The hinterlander can improve the attitude of a magical beast regardless of its Intelligence score. This ability functions like wild empathy, except the hinterlander takes no penalty for attempting this check.

Monstrous Humanoids: The hinterlander gains a +2 bonus on all saves against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used by monstrous humanoids.

Undead: Arrows loosed from a hinterlander's bow are infused with divine power and deal full damage to any undead that are incorporeal, as if the arrows had the ghost touch weapon special ability.

Master Archer (Ex): At 1st level, and again at 3rd and 5th levels, a hinterlander gains a bonus feat from the following list, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites: Erastil's Blessing, Far Shot, Focused Shot, Point-Blank Shot, and Rapid Shot. At 3rd level, he adds Improved Precise Shot, Parting Shot, Point-Blank Master, and Manyshot to the list. At 5th level, he adds Pinpoint Targeting and Shot on the Run to the list. The benefits of these feats apply only when the hinterlander wears light, medium, or no armor.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 2nd level, a hinterlander's base land speed increases by 10 feet.

Favored Terrain (Hinterland) (Ex): At 2nd level, when a hinterlander is within a 10-mile radius of a settlement with a population of 2,000 or fewer individuals, he gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks. A hinterlander traveling through this terrain leaves no trail and can't be tracked (although he can leave a trail if he so desires). At 9th level, these initiative and skill bonuses increase to +4, and the bonuses function as long as the hinterlander is within 20 miles of a settlement with a population of 2,000 or fewer.

Hinterland Stride (Ex): At 3rd level, a hinterlander moves with ease through natural and agrarian environments. This functions exactly like woodland stride, except that a hinterlander also moves normally through any nonmagical difficult terrain in settled areas with a population of 2,000 or less individuals, such as a farm or village.

Chosen Kin (Su): At 4th level, as a standard action, a hinterlander can designate a number of allies up to 3 + his Wisdom modifier to be his chosen kin. Allies so designated gain half the hinterlander's favored terrain (hinterland) bonus and half of the bonuses granted by defended hearth (see below). Members of his chosen kin must remain within 30 feet of the hinterlander in order to gain these benefits. At 7th level, this range increases to 60 feet.

Defended Hearth (Su): At 6th level, a hinterlander can designate a settlement as a defended hearth, allowing him to sense the presence of unnatural creatures within 5 miles of it. Aberrations, constructs, dragons, magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, outsiders, and undead constitute unnatural presences for this purpose. Though the hinterlander is aware of potential danger, he doesn't know the exact nature or location of the creature unless he can perceive it.

The defended hearth must be a settled area with a population of 2,000 or fewer individuals, and the hinterlander must spend 24 hours carefully studying the entire area to activate this ability, after which he gains a +2 favored terrain bonus in that settlement, which stacks with any other favored terrain bonus he receives in that area. This bonus increases to +4 at 10th level. A hinterlander can have a number of defended hearths equal to his Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). When he reaches his maximum number of defended hearths, he can select a new defended hearth by abandoning an existing one and performing the ritual for a new area.

Imbue Arrow (Su): At 7th level, a hinterlander gains the ability to place a spell that affects an area upon an arrow. This functions exactly like the arcane archer ability of the same name.

Waymarker Travel (Sp): At 10th level, a hinterlander gains the ability to create a waymarker anywhere within the area of a defended hearth. The hinterlander can maintain up to five waymarkers at a time-if the hinterlander creates a sixth waymarker, he chooses which of the previous five deactivates. Once per day as a move action, the hinterlander can cast word of recall as a spell-like ability to teleport to any of his active waymarkers.
