Description

Crafted of overlaid bronze, steel, and chain, each Vudran Ashak helmet is a work of art. These exotic helmets possess three stylized faces, each serene visage staring in a different direction (with the wearer's face concealed behind the central sculpted plate). The helm allows the wearer to see in every direction, granting him immunity to being flanked, as well as granting a +4 enhancement bonus on all vision-based Perception checks.

One in every 10 Vudran Ashak helmets is an intelligent magical item, having spontaneously manifested such properties after the deaths of heroically devoted former wearers. Such helms are lawful good, speak Vudran, and have an ego score of 10. These lingering personalities prove noble, knowledgable of Vudra's diverse deities, and actively encourage wearers to defend the holy places of such gods and their devout worshipers. Some might even possess goals from their lives that they wish their new wearer to fulfill. Despite any of the helmet's desires, though, it possesses no way to compel a wearer other than deactivating or reactivating its magical properties at will.
