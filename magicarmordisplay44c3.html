Description

The plates of this suit of +1 steel lamellar armorUC are etched with the complete Laws of Man from the secular nation of Rahadoum. Suits of armor of the Pure Legion are created for high-ranking members in the eponymous organization and grant protection against the two most common scourges of Rahadoum: divine magic and desert heat. Such armor grants its wearer spell resistance against divine spells equal to 5 + the wearer's base attack bonus. It also protects the wearer from heat dangers as if she were affected by a continuous endure elements spell. Additionally, once per day when the wearer of a suit of armor of the Pure Legion fails a Will save against a mindeffecting spell cast by a divine spellcaster, she can attempt another save as a free action on the following round to end the spell.
