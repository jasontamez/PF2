Description

Upon command, this item draws your surroundings, out to the limits of your normal vision, rendering them as if depicted by a competent but unexceptional artist. It does not record any details you cannot see. The autonomous cartographer creates the map as needed to fit upon a 1-foot-by-4-foot parchment or scroll contained within the item. A second command erases the scroll, allowing you to use it again. You may insert or remove a scroll as a full-round action.
