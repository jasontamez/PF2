Benefit: As a full-round action, you may make an attack that allows you to deal precision-based extra damage to a distance equal to your weapon's range increment. You may only make this attack with bows and crossbows. Precision-based damage includes sneak attacks, a ranger's favored weapon bonus, and the damage bonus from the Focused Shot feat. Creatures immune to critical hits and sneak attacks are immune to this extra damage.
