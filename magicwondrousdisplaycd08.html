Description

This badge depicts the Aspis Consortium's insignia: a coiled serpent. By speaking a command word, the wearer can transform the badge into one of five tools, selected from the following: <ul><li>A masterwork light steel shield bearing the Aspis insignia</li><li>A masterwork whip</li><li>A dagger poisoned with a dose of blue whinnis</li><li>A 50-foot silk rope with a grappling hook</li><li>A set of masterwork thieves' tools</li></ul> The badge remains in the chosen form for up to 24 hours or until it is commanded to return to its natural shape. Each form retains the badge's metallic hue, and the badge can transform in this way only five times before it loses its magical properties forever, becoming a mundane Aspis badge.

Most Aspis badges of last resort are bronze, yet some higher-ranking agents commission badges made of silver or gold. Most of these badges also have a unique array of objects they can turn into-including weapons and shields with magical properties.
