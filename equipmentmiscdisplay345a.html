Description

These small gray-white tablets are made of dehydrated and condensed garlic bulbs. One hour after you eat a garlic tablet, you begin to stink as the essence of the tablet seeps out of your pores. This state lasts for 4 hours. Subsequent doses of garlic tablets reset this duration. During this time, you can keep a vampire at bay (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 270) as a free action without need of a holy symbol or mirror. The vampire must succeed at a DC 25 Will save to overcome its natural revulsion to garlic; failure means it must stay at least 5 feet away from you and cannot touch you or make melee attacks against you. However, unlike while keeping a vampire at bay with a mirror or holy symbol, once the vampire succeeds at its save against the garlic tablets, it's no longer affected by that creature's odor and may act normally without need of further saving throws.

Garlic tablets are valuable aids to vampire hunters, but while benefiting from the tablets' strong odor, you take a -2 penalty on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks for the duration of the effect. The listed price is for three tablets.Crafting garlic tablets requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
