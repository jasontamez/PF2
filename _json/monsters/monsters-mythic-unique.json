			"description": [
				"Arazni was once a demigod and herald to Aroden. As the Red Crusader, she rode into battle during the Shining Crusade. Yet her bravery and might were of no avail against the Whispering Tyrant, who humiliated her before torturing her to death, throwing her broken form amid the ranks of her army to dishearten them. But even in death Arazni found no comfort. She lay in rest only 67 years before the overzealous Knights of Ozem provoked the witch-king Geb, who raised some of the fallen knights as grave knights and sent them to bring Arazni's revered remains to him. Not content with her corpse, he infused deathless vitality into her and bound her spirit up in her bones, making her his Harlot Queen. She rules still in his stead.",
				"Arazni's onetime disciples in the Knights of Ozem have resolved to lay her finally to rest. The knights possess the Bloodstones of Arazni (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Artifacts & Legends 13): four of her organs kept in funerary jars, which they recovered from Geb. They believe those bearing these jars have the protection of both holy aura and mind blank against Arazni's magic (in addition to an ability unique to each jar). But whether the jars hold the key to truly destroying her has not yet been proven. The Harlot Queen plots in secret to destroy-or recover, if possible-all the remaining jars. Her graveknight bodyguards monitor for any sign of the Bloodstones. It's said that Arazni senses the location of a jar when it's used, but no one can be sure whether this is true or a rumor the Harlot Queen has spread to keep those relics from being used.",
				"Arazni's Staff of the Magi (Minor Artifact): Arazni possesses an unusual staff of the magi that Geb recovered from a nameless pharaoh's tomb and offered his newly risen bride. This staff of the magi uses its wielder's caster level, Intelligence modifier, and feats when determining its spells' saving throws, rather than the set save DCs of a typical staff of the magi. In addition, if the wielder knows the mythic version of one of the staff \"s spells, she can expend uses of mythic power to cast or augment that spell as if she were casting it normally. If the wielder doesn't know the mythic version of a spell, she can use the mythic version of that spell by expending one use of mythic power per 2 levels of the spell (rounding up); a mythic spell cast this way can't be augmented. The wielder can use metamagic feats in conjunction with spells cast from her staff if she has a way to apply the feats on the spot without increasing the spells\" caster levels (such as Arazni's arcane metamastery path ability, a metamagic rod, or the Spell Perfection feat).",
				"Arazni's staff of the magi can create unique fireballs, which cost 2 charges to cast. These fireballs begin as eruptions of black fire, but coalesce into explosive waves of freezing darkness. These fireballs can deal fire damage, cold damage, or half cold and half fire. Creatures failing their saving throws against such a fireball are staggered for 1 round by the force of the explosion. In addition, the area of the fireball is treated as deeper darkness until the end of the wielder's next turn. Any creature or object that enters the darkness during this time takes damage as if it had been in the area when the fireball was cast. This power replaces telekinesis.",
				"Harlot's Kiss (Minor Artifact): Arazni's scarlet-hilted rapier is a relic of her days as the Red Crusader. Her blade acts as a +1 conductive dancing keen rapier, and its conductive property can be used once per round even while it is dancing.",
				"The blade has two abilities only Arazni can use. If she hurls Harlot's Kiss using the hand of the apprentice ability, it can perform a full attack against a single target rather than a single attack, instantly returning to Arazni at the end of her turn. However, she can't use hand of the apprentice on the rapier while it's dancing. If Arazni expends one use of mythic power when commanding the weapon to dance, the weapon's attacks use her caster level as the base attack bonus (effectively gaining a +10 bonus on attack rolls) for as long as it dances."

As a result, her ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than using the standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. Additionally, Baba Yaga has much more gear than an NPC of her level would normally have. These modifications increase her total CR by 2.",
				"**Forceful Presence (Ex)** Baba Yaga adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to her Armor Class and on all of her saving throws. In addition, Baba Yaga uses her Charisma score as well as her Constitution score when calculating hit points. This ability increases her total CR by 1.",
				"**Hut Familiar (Ex)** Baba Yaga built her Dancing Hut using a combination of the witch's hut hex and the sanctum mythic path ability, and over time expanded the artifact's powers to its present state. The Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga serves as Baba Yaga's familiar, and replaces the normal witch's familiar ability. Baba Yaga's life is forever intertwined with her Dancing Hut and parts of her essence reside within it. As long as the hut exists, this special connection grants her 300 bonus hit points, DR 10/epic and good, and regeneration 20. This ability increases her total CR by 1.",
				"**Immortal (Su)** Baba Yaga has hidden her death to make herself even more difficult to kill. This functions as the base mythic ability (Mythic Adventures 13), but Baba Yaga always returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of how she is killed. In order to permanently kill Baba Yaga, her death must be found and released back into her body, at which point she can be killed with a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.",

She gains the +3 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age, but she doesn't gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution resulting from this advanced age. Baba Yaga's supernaturally empowered life grants her complete immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, energy drain, petrification, poison, and all forms of madness (including confusion effects and feeblemind). This ability increases her total CR by 1.",
				"**Permanent Spells (Sp)** Through the use of permanency, Baba Yaga is constantly under the effect of the following spells: arcane sight, darkvision, read magic, see invisibility, and tongues. Baba Yaga has also devised a way to inscribe symbol spells upon her person. Baba Yaga has permanent symbols of death (DC 36) magically inscribed on the center of her chest, between her shoulder blades, upon the crown of her head, and on the soles of her feet. Only a few great beings have knowledge of the symbols' passwords (each symbol has its own unique phrase), and even fewer significant personalities have been attuned to the symbols.",
				"**Queen of Witches (Ex)** As Queen of Witches, Baba Yaga knows all witch spells, as well as all sorcerer/wizard spells. Baba Yaga also has knowledge of many other spells that she has researched. Many of these are arcane versions of divine spells. In addition, Baba Yaga can create artifacts, and has done so to great extent, the greatest of which is the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga."

			"description": [
				"The ambitious Gnargorak always hungered for power and status, but he didn't aspire to be Jarl of all Jarls until Winter's Heart came into his grasp. The sword whispered dreams of greatness to Gnargorak, of lordship over all frost giants. The first obstacle to establishing his regime was the ancient silver dragon Lanargix, long a thorn in the side of frost giants throughout the Tusk Mountains. Jarl Gnargorak filled her hide with a dozen arrows before meeting her in melee, sword to claw. With the dead dragon's horns adorning his staff, Gnargorak proclaimed himself the chosen of Thremyr and high jarl of all frost giants, in the Tusk Mountains and beyond. Now, a full score of Tusk Mountain jarls openly swear fealty to Gnargorak. Others placate him, lest they draw his wrath. Only the jarl's lack of focus and unceasing need to conquer keeps him from uniting the remaining giants of the Tusks under one banner.",
				"The skulls of those who dared dispute his sovereignty line the path to his mountain fortress of Bos-Phargrumm (see page 33). He rarely sets foot in this ice castle, as raiding the hated Mammoth Lords brings him far more pleasure than consolidating his rule. The towering citadel that reaches into the clouds stays busy even without its ostensible owner sitting upon its massive, ornate throne. Jarl Gnargorak's cloud giant harem lives there, serving as his advisors, maintaining the treasuries, collecting taxes from lands Gnargorak has claimed, and negotiating with the tribes on the jarl's behalf. They grow tired of this work, as the jarl is far more interested in conquering new territory than in ruling over that which he holds.",
				"Winter's Heart also grows weary of Gnargorak's lack of dedication to building a true empire. Of late, the sword has denied the jarl its greater powers except in times of dire need. It constantly searches for another potential leader to bear it and use it to impose rule over the north. Of course, the jarl never lets Winter's Heart leave his presence, so the sword's options are limited. The artifact is unattended only while the jarl is in his personal chambers, where he feels he's safe. But one of his harem has communicated with the sword and sympathizes with its goals. She watches for the best candidates, and invites them to Bos-Phargrumm on false pretenses so she can weigh their acumen. She and Winter's Heart haven't found a suitable leader among the frost giants; there's no shortage of ambition among their kind, but no tribal leader has half the experience or cunning Gnargorak does.",
				"Though other frost giants admire and fear Jarl Gnargorak's prowess in battle, they view his harem of cloud giants with private derision and a touch of envy. Even given the jarl's imposing 16-foot stature, his brides all stand noticeably taller than he. Gnargorak prizes his exotic harem, and eagerly anticipates the birth of a son surely destined to be the mightiest frost giant in all the Tusks. Yet despite his many brides, the jarl's seed has yet to bear fruit. His displeasure over this continued lack of an heir drives him to ever more brutal raids against the Mammoth Lords so that he can at least leave a legacy of conquest and make a mark for all to see in the histories of the north-even if there would be no one of his own blood to take over his domain.",
				"Jarl Gnargorak leads a veritable army, but because he started out as a hunter, not a soldier, he uses his forces in unconventional ways that suit the tactics he learned in the wild. Rather than simply leading an overwhelming force directly into battle against the Mammoth Lords, he draws the warriors' attention away from the safety of their followings and into his snares and ambushes. Only when a group is weakened does he sweep in to destroy them.",

				"Kortash Khain is the high priest on Golarion of the demon lord Kabriri, the Lord of Everglut. He rules as Priest-King of Nemret Noktoria, a city of bone-white towers where ghouls dwell. His city lies deep in the vaults of Sekamina in the Darklands below Osirion. Kabriri rules over the Abyssal city of Everglut, a cyclopean necropolis inhabited by ghouls and riddled with tunnels. All Kortash Khain's immortal thought is bent on replicating his master's dead city within the living world.",
				"Though Khain has sent ambassadors to Thuvia, Osirion, and their neighbors to conduct trade negotiations, thoughts of war, insurrection, and murder are never far from his mind. Much of his wrath has been turned against the nearby inhabitants of the Darklands' his purges have largely depopulated Sekamina in the vicinity of his city. A fortunate few are merely dead and devoured-all of the rest have been absorbed into Khain's ever-growing ghoul army.",
				"Not even the genies of Garund have escaped the Priest- King's capture squads. Many have been defeated and converted by the powers of death into great ghuls, often serving in positions of prominence as atamans, beys, and pashas under Khain's dominion. The most powerful of these are four great ghul oracles called the Quadrate Pillars, each formed from the undead remnant of a genie twisted into serving in death the element that was its opposite in life. A few renegade shaitans have been converted to the worship of Kabriri, and serve Kortash Khain as architects, engineers, and builders in his city. This socalled Blackstone Brotherhood is held in high esteem in Nemret Noktoria not only for its architectural creations but also for its members' prowess as hunters. They infiltrate their genie brethren and lure them into ambushes.",
				"Kortash Khain and any other clerics or oracles worshiping Kabriri gain several unique options when summoning or creating undead to serve them. They add the following creatures to their summon monster lists: I-fiendish human zombie (standard or fast zombie); II-fiendish ghoul, fiendish plague zombie; III-fiendish ghast; IV-giant fiendish ghast; V-ghul; VI-fiendish ghul, great ghul; VII-fiendish great ghul, fiendish shaitan; VIII-black jinni; IX-fiendish black jinni. When using create undead, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can create a ghul or great ghul from the corpse of a genie rather than creating a mummy (minimum caster level 15th). When creating a ghoul, ghast, ghul, or great ghul with this spell, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can also apply the fiendish template to that creature. This requires the caster to double the normal material component cost or sacrifice a living humanoid as an additional material component of casting the spell."

				"**Exceptional Wealth (Ex)** Jatembe has the wealth of a 20th-level PC, rather than an NPC. This increases his CR by 1.",
				"**Gifts of the Teachers (Ex)** Old-Mage Jatembe sought the knowledge and assistance of many great powers-from angels to demons to gods'so he could help his people. Among the gifts they bestowed on him were permanent versions of augmented mythic barkskin, mind blank, and shapechange, plus the knowledge and power that allowed him to develop his enhanced divine knowledge ability. These increase his CR by 1.",
				"**Jatembe's Divine Knowledge (Ex)** Jatembe has a much stronger version of the divine knowledge archmage path ability (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 19). He has the following spells on his list of spells known: barkskin, call lightning, entangle, forest friend, lesser restoration, plant growth, speak with animals, and speak with plants.",
				"**Perfect Preparation (Ex)** Jatembe no longer needs a spellbook to prepare spells. He knows and can prepare any wizard spell from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook that doesn't have the evil descriptor, any spell from pages 28 and 29 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths & Philosophies (casting these as though they were wizard spells of the highest level listed in their descriptions), and possibly others as well, including unique ones he's researched.",
				"**Permanent Spells (Sp)** Through the use of permanency, Jatembe is constantly under the effects of the following spells: arcane sight, darkvision, see invisibility, and telepathic bond (once with each of his Ten Magic Warriors). He is under the effect of a contingency that causes dimension door to come into effect if he's brought below 80 hit points."
			],
			"description": [
				"No character looms larger in the myths of the Mwangi tribes than Old-Mage Jatembe. Jatembe rose to prominence in the Age of Anguish, a time when mankind was just beginning to recover from the devastation caused by Earthfall and the destruction of Azlant. Jatembe was the first among humanity to rediscover the art of wizardry and written magic, and did much to redeem these arts in the eyes of a superstitious people. Jatmebe worked tirelessly to stem the tide of barbarism left in the wake of the Age of Darkness, and preserve the learning and culture of his people. He is remembered as a folk hero among the Mwangi, and as a beacon of hope in a darkest of times.",
				"Little is known about Jatembe's origins. Even in the earliest of myths, he's described as an old man. Some scholars point out parallels between Jatembe's ageless nature and the immortal masters of the lost city of Ird, suggesting that fabled city as his birthplace, though the decadent and cruel lords of Ird have little else in common with him. Later accounts claim Jatembe and his disciples destroyed the city of Ird to punish it for its wickedness, casting doubt on this theory. Other myths connect Jatembe with the druids of the Mwangi Expanse, some even claiming he was an ex-druid himself. True or not, Jatembe did have an affinity for druidic magic, and the magical school he founded-the Magaambya-continues to teach druid spells to this day.",
				"The details of Jatembe's ascension are similarly occluded by millennia of myth and legend. One popular tale holds that Jatembe learned the deepest mysteries of magic from the severed head of Ydersius before sewing the serpent-god's lips shut. Others claim he gained mythic knowledge from sources among the planes, for many tales tell of his dealings with angels, demons, and other outsiders while in search of ways to protect his people. Still more stories say that Jatembe found some potent artifact amid the ruins of the Mwangi that awakened his mythic potential, and that he departed Golarion once the strength of this artifact had faded.",
				"Prior to his mysterious departure, Jatembe performed many astonishing deeds. The first of these was the gathering of his disciples, the Ten Magic Warriors. These men and women were known only by the golden animal masks they wore, having forsaken their identities in service to Jatembe and his quest. With their help, Jatembe explored the ancient ruins that dot the Mwangi Expanse, uncovering ancient magical secrets and treasures. He founded the city of Nantambu and the Magaambya arcane academy to preserve and share knowledge and wealth with future generations, and to protect the Expanse from further devastation such as that wrought by the Earthfall. In later days, Jatembe fought and defeated the twisted sorcerer known as the King of Biting Ants, who claimed to possess a weapon that would allow him to eat the sun and cast the world into darkness.",
				"For reasons unknown, Jatembe departed Golarion; if anyone knows where he left to, they're silent on the matter. Some believe he left to fulfill obligations to the beings who granted him mythic power, and others think a magnificent spell took him. He left his Ten Magic Warriors behind to rule in his place, and forged the Ring of Nine Facets (Artifacts and Legends 40) to aid them in his absence. He has created and used other artifacts in his travels, but gave them all away to allies, keeping only the beacon of true faith that one of his patrons gave him."

			"description": [
				"Void dragons are a cursed race, born on the boundary between rational space and the vast unknowable nothingness that lurks between the stars. They are not typically evil, but few escape the notice of the unnamable beings that dwell within that distant void. The fortunate ones resist the fell influence of the Dark Tapestry and survive with their minds intact.",
				"Raskineya was not one of the fortunate ones. The taint of the void shattered her mind, driving her to mindless violence and destruction. In her madness she sought out the inner planets of Golarion's solar system, plunging into the gravity wells of the inhabited worlds to feed and raze before fleeing back to the stars and plotting her next attack.",
				"This urge to destroy is what brought her to the attention of the cult of Rovagug. Priests of the Rough Beast often enslave powerful creatures to serve as proxies for their shackled god and guardians for their hidden temples, and Raskineya's savagery and madness made her an excellent prospect. The priests called to the stars, whispering promises of blood to the dragon to lure her into their waiting clutches. In her unthinking madness, she was no match for the cunning priests, and soon she was subdued, shackled, and locked in a cavern hidden deep within the earth.",
				"Raskineya languished at first, longing to once again fly to the stars and seek exotic new prey. Yet the priests had not lied to her when they promised her blood. She was given sacrifices and allowed to hunt and feed within her underground prison. With each such sacrifice, she not only grew stronger and more focused, but also found began to understand the prayers given to her. This world was promised to Rovagug, and he would have it. All worlds were promised to him, and he would destroy them all. Even the gods themselves would fall to his power, and in his wake only nothingness would remain. Raskineya found in Rovagug something she had not realized she was searching for: someone to champion. If she could but release this Unmaker, she could at long last have vengeance upon this existence, and upon the nameless ones who drew her here. All that would be left in his wake would be nothingness, and to nothingness her heart longed to return.",
				"With her newfound sense of purpose, Raskineya turned upon her captors. Her mind intact for the first time in centuries, she quickly overpowered them. First, she swallowed the high priest alive, consuming his life and essence to fuel her ascension. Then she enslaved the priests, and commanded them to find her a way to unleash their god upon the world once more. From them she learned of a prophecy, set down by the oracles of the brimstone haruspex, that a dark comet would herald the return of Gormuz-the first and most powerful of Rovagug's spawn-who would in turn unleash the Rough Beast himself. Raskineya sees herself as this dark comet, and demands all those who address her to call her by that name (with a slow death awaiting to those who do not).",
				"In the years since her ascension, Raskineya first scoured the world searching for the Star Towers-artifacts created by the gods to strengthen Rovagug's prison. The dragon was certain that if she could locate the first of these towers and destroy it, the rest will fall like dominoes, weakening the foundations of Rovagug's prison enough to allow his escape. She moved from Star Tower to Star Tower, searching for clues as to the location of the original. She last conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, winning it from a paladin of Sarenrae named Dazma the Bright, who had learned of the dragon's design on the tower and marshaled an army to defend it. Raskineya vanquished Dazma and her army by dragging meteors from the sky to drop on the Sarenites. Those who survived the initial bombardment were savaged by akatas carried within the meteors, leaving the remainder easy pickings for the dragon.",
				"Though it seemed she was getting closer to her goal, Raskineya's devotion to Rovagug made her actions unpredictable. Just as she conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, she heard a pressing call she believed came from Rovagug himself. She flew to the Pit of Gormuz, where she made a den in the Crater of Carnal Joining in anticipation of the Rough Beast's arrival. There she waits, conducting horrific rituals to attract his attention. She brought with her the Sarenite survivors of the raid on the Star Tower, who she keeps alive as subjects for her rites. Once noble soldiers, they're now maimed and driven mad, kept in perpetual darkness within a small cave in Raskineya's lair. The warriors of the Maimed Legion, as she calls them, see light only when they're being tortured."

				"**Animate Touch (Su)** As a standard action, the Whispering Tyrant can touch a dead creature and animate it as a skeleton or zombie, as if using animate dead. He can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to animate the body as a different type of undead, as if using greater create undead. The Whispering Tyrant treats his total Hit Dice as his caster level for these effects. Undead created in this way are automatically under his control. The Whispering Tyrant does not need to expend any material components when using this ability. This ability replaces the creeping paralysis mythic lich ability.",
				"**Aura of Absolute Terror (Su)** Living creatures within 60 feet of the Whispering Tyrant are paralyzed by absolute terror for 1d4 rounds, after which they are shaken as long as they remain within his aura. Once a creature has been paralyzed by this aura, it is immune for 24 hours. Mythic creatures receive a DC 29 Will save to negate the paralysis, but are still shaken as long as they remain within the aura. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This ability replaces the formidable animation mythic lich ability.",
				"**Perfect Necromancer (Ex)** The Whispering Tyrant can prepare spells from his opposition schools without needing to expend an additional spell slot. He always succeeds at concentration checks to cast spells. He can have any number of undead under his control, and he is not limited by the total Hit Dice of those undead. This ability replaces the enhanced spellcasting mythic lich ability."

			"description": [
				"The Whispering Tyrant was perhaps the greatest threat that the people of the Inner Sea have ever known. Even after his defeat atop Gallowspire, he wasn't finished. The forces that brought him low had no choice but to seal him within the tower that was once his capital.",
				"Before becoming a lich, the Whispering Tyrant was a powerful necromancer by the name Tar-Baphon. Though his origins are lost to time, it's thought that he grew up on the shores of Lake Encarthan, where he first studied the necromantic arts. As his power grew, so did his ambition, eventually leading him to the Cenotaph, the resting place of the slumbering runelord of gluttony. After unlocking the powers of Zutha, Tar-Baphon gained power beyond that of mortals. He realized then that true greatness required bringing the world itself under his control-alive or dead, all would serve him.",
				"His campaign was brutal. Enlisting nearby orcs and undead, he quickly conquered Ustalav and began a conquest that consumed most of central Avistan. He set down stones on the Isle of Terror, intent upon making it his capital. His actions drew the attention of Aroden, the Last Azlanti, who knew what destruction the runelords had caused, and refused to allow the world to return to those ancient ways. The two met on the Isle of Terror in 896 ar. The battle raged for days and leveled the entire surface of the island. Tar-Baphon's broken form lay among the rubble, and Aroden buried him there, thinking that was the end of the threat.",
				"However, Tar-Baphon had intended to die by Aroden's hand all along. His studies had revealed to him that his only true path to immortality lay in undeath. For Tar-Baphon's last step in becoming a lich beyond compare, he needed to be killed by a god, and Aroden served this purpose. The process sparked by Aroden took time, however, and for 2,307 years Tar-Baphon's body laid dead in the ground before he returned to grim unlife. The Whispering Tyrant was born.",
				"He soon reestablished his power, animating thousands of dead. For centuries, the forces of the living were unable to resist the tide of the dead-with Aroden gone, nothing could stop the Whispering Tyrant. Only the Shining Crusade had a chance to end his threat. Bearing the Shield of Aroden, General Arnisant faced the lich, but when the Whispering Tyrant used a wish to summon the general's heart to his waiting claw, the symbol of Aroden flared to life, the shield shattered, and the lich's body was destroyed. Without a means to locate the Tyrant's phylactery, let alone destroy it, the crusaders instead sealed him away in his tower, where their descendants remain ever watchful for his return."
