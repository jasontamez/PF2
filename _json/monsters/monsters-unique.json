		"special_abilities": [
			"**Aura of Suffocation (Su)** Agmazar's alien presence breaks down the atmosphere around it, causing the air to become thin and nearly unbreathable. Within 1 mile of Agmazar, breathing creatures are subject to fatigue and altitude sickness as if at high peak altitude (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 430). Creatures within 60 feet of Agmazar must hold their breath or begin to suffocate (Core Rulebook 445).",
			"**Channel Negative Energy (Su)** Agmazar can channel negative energy as a 20th-level evil cleric. This ability requires no divine focus.",
			"**Creaturesense (Ex)** Agmazar has lifesense up to 120 feet. In addition, it can sense the presence and position of undead creatures within 1,200 feet as if it had blindsense.",
			"**Force Field (Su)** Agmazar is surrounded by a field of force that grants it a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus and resistance 30 against force effects. Its natural weapons are treated as force effects for dealing damage to incorporeal or ethereal targets. The first time each round Agmazar is targeted with a ranged attack, there's a 75% chance that attack is deflected by the force field, with a 50% chance of it being reflected back upon its originator and a 50% chance of it being deflected toward a random creature within 60 feet of Agmazar (or deflected harmlessly if no creature is within this range). This deflected attack uses the same attack roll result, caster level, and save DC as the original attack.",
			"**Gravitic Control (Su)** Agmazar can radically alter the effect of gravity, bending or even inverting gravity to suit its will. As a standard action, it can alter gravity for 2d6 rounds, choosing one of five effects (with effective caster level 20). Only one type of gravitic control can be in effect at a time. Involuntary movement forced by gravitic control doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Agmazar and its serpent arms are immune to its gravitic control, except for gravitic deceleration. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"- Gravitic Acceleration: This ability functions as telekinesis (CMB +35, Will DC 40).",
			"- Gravitic Attraction: This ability functions as repulsion but in reverse; any creature that fails its saving throw (Will DC 40) can't move away from Agmazar. Each round it doesn't spend a move action resisting the attraction, it is pulled 1d6 x 5 feet toward Agmazar.",
			"- Gravitic Deceleration: All creatures within 30 feet are affected as by feather fall. Flying creatures in this radius move at half speed, and a creature making a ranged weapon attack targeting a creature in the radius takes a -2 penalty on the attack roll.",
			"- Gravitic Inversion: This ability functions as reverse gravity (Reflex DC 40), but Agmazar can concentrate on the spell. Each round it continues to do so, the radius of the effect doubles.",
			"- Gravitic Repulsion: This ability functions as repulsion, but a creature that fails its saving throw (Will DC 40) not only can't move toward Agmazar, but is also pushed 1d6 x 5 feet away from the kaiju each round it doesn't spend a move action resisting the gravitic repulsion.",
			"Powerful Blows (Ex) Agmazar adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus on damage rolls with slam attacks.",
			"**Serpent Arms (Su)** As a full-round action, Agmazar can detach and release one or two of the lower arms from its body, revealing that the joints buried into its torso are alien serpent heads. The arms move and fight independently as hollow serpents (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 149), beginning on the round they're detached. For each arm it detaches, Agmazar takes 25 points of damage that can't be reduced.",
			"When a hollow serpent uses channel negative energy or a spell-like ability, it counts against Agmazar's uses of that ability. While its arms are detached, Agmazar's fast healing is reduced by 10 for each missing arm, and it can make slam attacks only with the arms still attached. If a hollow serpent is destroyed while separated, Agmazar can regrow its missing arm in 1 hour. Reattaching one or both lower arms is a full-round action and restores Agmazar's fast healing to the normal rate (though does not regain the hit points lost from detaching)."

			"**Ahriman's Scourge (Su)** Ahriman's Huge scourge is made from the spines of genies. It deals 3d6 points of damage, and gains the bane weapon special ability when used it to attack a genie. The scourge only functions for Ahriman. If his scourge is lost or destroyed, Ahriman can magically create a new one from the skeletons of four genies.",
			"**Aura of Hopelessness (Su)** Any creature that comes within 30 feet of Ahriman must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"**Bottomless Maw (Su)** When Ahriman bites a creature and successfully grabs it, he magically banishes the creature to an extraplanar bottomless pit. Ahriman can't swallow a creature that has the good subtype or is affected by holy aura. ",
			"A swallowed creature takes 2d8+12 points of sonic damage each round as it plummets endlessly through Ahriman's cacophonous interior-a repulsive, lightless pit where heresies and praises to Ahriman are screamed in all languages at once. The creature must also succeed at a DC 39 Will save each round or be dominated, as dominate monster, for 1 day. Ahriman knows when a creature becomes dominated, and can expel any creature as a move action, causing it to appear in any adjacent square. The save DC is Constitution-based. ",
			"A swallowed creature can't cut its way out. Any creature in the area of silence or a similar affect is unaffected by the sonic damage and domination. A swallowed creature can escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Lord of All Divs is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all creatures in his stomach if a creature in his stomach casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature either inside or out of his stomach casts atonement, freedom, holy word, limited wish, miracle, or wish.",
			"**Consume Essence (Su)** Ahriman's soul-rending savagery erodes the fundamental essence of his victims. When he confirms a critical hit with a natural weapon, the target takes 1d6 points of ability drain to a random ability score (Fortitude DC 39 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"**Crown of Fourfold Curses (Su)** The ancient curses graven on the horns crowning Ahriman's head grant him a +14 profane bonus to AC and a +4 profane bonus to spell resistance against spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or those cast by good creatures. If Ahriman confirms a critical hit with his gore attack, the target is stricken with bestow curse (DC 36). The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"**Freeing Chains (Su)** Multiple chains wrap around Ahriman's body, and three select links can free him if he's bound. Ahriman can break one of these links to gain the benefits of freedom. He can do this as an immediate action to negate an applicable effect being cast on him.",
			"**Lord of All Divs (Ex, Su)** Ahriman gains a suite of traits as Lord of the Divs.",
			"- Regeneration (Ex) Only epic and good damage, good damage from a mythic source, or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as an archdevil, deity, or demon lord) interrupts Ahriman's regeneration.",
			"- Immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, energy drain, and petrification.",
			"- Resistance to acid 30 and electricity 30.",
			"- Resurrection (Ex) Ahriman's power is rooted in his domain in Abaddon. If he is slain, his body collapses into a mass of writhing snakes and is restored to life (as true resurrection) at the foot of his mountain. Once this occurs, Ahriman can't use this ability until a full year has passed; if slain again before that time, he is forever destroyed.",
			"- Frightful Presence (Su) Ahriman can activate his frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, spell-like ability, special attack, or by speaking aloud.",
			"- Summon Divs (Sp) Three times per day as a swift action, Ahriman can summon any div or combination of divs whose total combined CR is 20 or lower, or summon a unique div of his choice. This otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule, with a 100% chance of success, and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.",
			"- Telepathy 300 feet.",
			"- Ahriman's natural weapons and any weapons he wields are treated as epic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"- Ahriman can grant spells to his worshipers as if he were a deity. His domains are Darkness, Death, Destruction, and Evil. His favored weapon is the whip.",
			"Shake Faith (Su) When Ahriman strikes a divine spellcaster with a melee attack, the target is shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 38 reduces the duration to 1 round). On a critical hit, the target is frightened instead of shaken for the same duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"**Skin of Serpents (Su)** Ahriman's flesh writhes with countless vipers, embodiments of ancient and forgotten evils. Any creature striking Ahriman in melee (unless using a reach weapon) must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the creature fails its save, Ahriman gains 5 temporary hit points.",
			"**Slaughtered Slave (Su)** Any humanoid slain by Ahriman becomes a cairn wight (or brute wight if it was a giant) in 1d4 rounds. A genie killed by Ahriman instead rises as a ghul in 1d4 rounds. The creature is enslaved to Ahriman's will and loses all abilities and memories it had in life.",
			"**Symbolic Prison (Su)** When Ahriman entraps a creature in his bottomless maw or in a maze spell, he can use one of his symbol spell-like abilities as a swift action. The symbol affects all creatures within the prison, and ends when all creatures have escaped the maw or maze."

			"**Transdimensional Tentacles (Su)** Black Magga's tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow while she is on the Material Plane. This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a dimensional lock or similar effect. She can grapple foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull grappled foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift between them.",
			"**Warp Dimensions (Su)** Black Magga's presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature that attempts to utilize a teleportation effect while within 300 feet of Black Magga must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check or the teleport effect fails.

			"**Darkwood Breastplate (Su, Ex)** The herald's +4 darkwood breastplate has all the normal properties of darkwood but is as hard and strong as steel (similar to wood created with an ironwood spell).",
			"**Favored Enemy (Ex)** The herald has the favored enemy ability of a 17th-level ranger.",
			"**Imbue with Power (Su)** The herald can imbue an ally with a portion of her power. This ability functions like imbue with spell ability, except she may transfer uses of the following spell-like abilities as if they were cleric spells: cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, peasant armaments, protection from arrows, shield other, and status. Using this ability reduces the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability until she dismisses the transfer or the recipient expends it (for example, if she imbues a target with cure moderate wounds, thereafter she can only use that spell-like ability twice per day).",
			"**Martyr's Blood (Su)** By marking an ally with her blood, the herald can transfer part of her fast healing ability to that ally. The herald's fast healing decreases by 1 (minimum 0), and the ally gains fast healing 1 for 1 hour. This ability has no effect if the target already has fast healing.",
			"**Rebellious Aura (Su)** The herald's aura grants allies within 60 feet the effects of good hope and a paladin's aura of courage. The effects of this ability are included in the herald's stat block.",
			"**Tactician (Ex)** The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day, one teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds). She may use this ability with any of her teamwork feats (Lookout, Outflank, Swap Places)."

			"As she has only been immortal for a few decades, Courage Heart still acts and feels like a mortal woman. She loves her homeland, cares deeply for her mortal relatives (most of whom have some elven blood and were alive when she was murdered), and enjoys worldly delights such as music and stories. Though she has an instinctive knowledge of the people and places near her, she has perfect recall of such things in Galt and feels great sorrow when she discovers that a building or person she knew in life has been destroyed or has died. She collects remnants of Galt's history, such as travel journals about its settlements, songs about its people, and sketches of its locations and inhabitants.",
			"Having died for her beliefs holding no expectation of ever returning, Courage Heart considers it an honor to die again and again in her goddess' service, especially if doing so advances the cause or saves mortal lives. The only thing she fears is torture, but she knows her immortal flesh is resistant to punishment and she has magic at her disposal to help her escape almost any confinement.",
			"Though she does not need to eat or drink, she still feels the urge to do so, and favors traditional Galtan food. A priest who calls her and has a Galtan meal ready for her is much more likely to get help than one who offers no such courtesy and expects immediate compliance."

		"special_abilities": [ "**Abyssal Rift (Su)** The first time Galundari slays a creature in a round (but no more than once per round), a rift tears open between the plane he currently occupies and the Abyss. The slain creature must immediately make a DC 29 Will save or his body and gear are drawn through the rift, transported to Galundari's trophy room in his palace on the Abyss. Regardless of whether the creature's body is drawn through the rift, the rift immediately slams shut a moment after it forms, creating a 20-foot-radius burst of chaotic energy that staggers all non-demons in the area of effect for 1d10 rounds-a DC 29 Fortitude save reduces the staggering effect to 1 round. If Galundari slays multiple creatures simultaneously, the body targeted by the rift is determined randomly. If the body targeted by the rift was a good outsider, all creatures (including the dead creature in danger of being pulled through the rift) take a -2 penalty on all saving throws against that specific Abyssal rift. This is a teleportation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based." ],

			"Kurshu's degenerative condition means that (unlike most outsiders) she must eat to survive; otherwise, she wastes away into a skeletal, nearly helpless version of herself. She reached that lowest point only once, but was lucky enough to catch suitable prey unawares and work her way back to an exhausted but functional level. Consequently, Kurshu makes sure to feed at least every few days.",
			"As there are few creatures in Lissala's service who have the power to conjure her, Kurshu is mainly left to her own devices, but (unlike heralds of active deities) may choose to respond to a summons from any spellcaster. In exchange for her services, she demands that she be given outsiders she can enslave for later feeding, Thassilonian magic items, or items that bear some lingering piece of Lissala's power. She is knowledgeable about Thassilonian magic, rune magic, and Azlanti practices, though she is hesitant to speak of the latter when on Golarion lest it attract unwanted attention from slaves of the aboleths; having witnessed Earthfall at a distance, she has no desire to subject herself to a direct attack by entities who control that kind of magic.",
			"Kurshu has no compunction about killing something that defies her or appears to be withholding information or objects she wants (if she has to, she can compel answers from its corpse using limited wish to duplicate speak with dead). She feels her pseudo-mortality at all times and fears death, and is likely to flee any encounter in which she feels outmatched."

			"- Immunity to charm and compulsion effects, death effects, fire, and poison.",
			"- Resistance to acid 30 and cold 30.",
			"- Telepathy 300 feet.",
			"- Lorthact's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"- Lorthact can grant spells to his worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on his behalf. Lorthact grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Magic, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.",
			"Intelligence Drain (Su)** Lorthact drains 1 point of Intelligence each time he hits with a weapon or natural weapon (Will DC 39 negates). Alternatively, he can make a single melee touch attack per round, dealing no hit point damage but draining 2d4 points of Intelligence (Will DC 39 half). After draining Intelligence from a creature, Lorthact gains the benefit of foresight (as the spell) against that creature for 1 minute.",
			"**Scholastic Masquerade (Su)** When targeting a dominated wizard with his spell reservoir ability, Lorthact can also steal a school power from that wizard's chosen school. He can steal one of the wizard's 1st-level school powers by using three levels of his spell reservoir, both 1st-level school powers at a cost of six levels, and all school powers at a cost of nine levels. While Lorthact retains these powers, the target wizard cannot use them. The stolen powers function at the target wizard's level. Lorthact can steal school powers or a prepared spell from a dominated wizard, but not both. He may steal school powers from multiple schools if he has multiple wizards dominated.",
			"**Spell Reservoir (Su)** Lorthact can drain prepared arcane spells from the mind of a creature he has dominated and store them for later use, similarly to a ring of spell storing. Draining a spell requires 1 full-round action if he is able to touch the target, or 1 minute to perform through the mental link provided by the dominate effect; in either case, no saving throw is allowed. He can hold no more than one stolen spell from each dominated caster in his spell reservoir, and the total level of stolen spells cannot exceed 25. These stolen spells take effect at the original caster's level.",
			"**Temporal Anomaly (Su)** Lorthact exists slightly outside of the normal timestream. Spells that predict the future-such as augury, divination, foresight, and moment of prescience- cannot perceive him and provide no benefit against him or information about him. In addition, whenever a creature within 60 feet of him uses time stop, Lorthact can act normally within the duration of the time stop, as if he had cast it himself. As neither Lorthact nor the caster are frozen in time with respect to each other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though they cannot affect other creatures within the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if Lorthact is flat-footed or unaware of his opponent."

The blood is extremely slippery and sprays out in a 20-foot radius, coating all creatures and surfaces in the area. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or drop any items they are holding. A saving throw must be made each round that the creature attempts to use or pick up an item it previously dropped.

In addition, spells and spell-like abilities granting a morale bonus are affected as dispel magic used to counterspell (caster level 23rd) every round at the beginning of Moxix's turn. A successful dispel check negates the entire effect (not just the morale bonus) and grants Moxix temporary hit points equal to the spell's level (to a maximum of 100). These temporary hit points last 1 hour.",

If the victim fails its save, it enters a sort of half-living state; it becomes completely helpless, unable to take any actions whatsoever, but remains conscious and aware of the world, and of the pain in its body. It cannot be resurrected or otherwise restored to life until the curse is lifted. While the curse remains in effect, the victim takes 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain every day as any lingering shreds of sanity are blasted away. When each ability score is drained to zero, the DC of the curse increases by +4. A character suffering the curse of living death can remain in this state forever, but as long as any one of her mental ability scores is at zero, she is capable only of enduring pain and cannot observe the world around her. Even if the character's body is destroyed, the cursed victim's consciousness remains as a disembodied and invisible presence at the site of this destruction, and cannot be resurrected or released to the afterlife.

			"**Guardian of Jandelay (Su)** The Oliphaunt was created to live in Jandelay, and attempting to remove it from the place is almost impossible. The Oliphaunt can prevent a gate or similar effect from opening inside Jandelay's borders unless the effect was created by an artifact or cast by a mythic character. If brought outside Jandelay, the Oliphaunt attempts a Will saving throw each day to return. The DC is equal to the DC of the spell that transported it, or the DC that spell would have if it allowed a saving throw. The return of the Oliphaunt triggers a magical punishment on those that stole it, laying waste to people and land. Centered on the point from which the Oliphaunt just departed, the ward triggers a mass hold monster spell targeting all creatures in a 5-mile radius. Then, that area is affected by an earthquake and storm of vengeance that last 1d12 months. While in Jandelay, the Oliphaunt's dimensional lock aura extends to protect the entire realm.",
			"**Massive (Ex)** The Oliphaunt is so enormous in scale that it gains the benefits of a kaiju's massive ability (see Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4).",
			"**Ruinous Tusks (Ex)** The Oliphaunt's gore attacks are treated as adamantine, and any creature hit by one is affected by a targeted greater dispel magic spell.",
			"**Ward against Command (Su)** The Oliphaunt is immune to any mind-affecting spell or effect unless the Oliphaunt has line of sight to the caster. Even then, all mind-affecting spells and effects gain the language-dependent descriptor. Magical means of translation such as tongues do not bypass this restriction.",
			"**Wards of Jandelay (Su)** Ancient protective magic was bound into the essence of the Oliphaunt. The wards give it a +20 deflection bonus to AC, spell resistance 41, and a constant freedom effect.",
			"**Weather Sphere (Su)** The Oliphaunt can continuously change the environment around it, as control weather with a 5-mile radius. The Oliphaunt can change the weather to that of any season, and the effects manifest 1 round thereafter. If the Oliphaunt creates stormy weather, it can call down one lightning bolt per round as a free action, as if using call lightning storm."

This gaze attack can be disabled as a move action, and is automatically disabled if the orrery uses its prismatic refraction ability or if the prismatic sphere is temporarily dispelled. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"**Dispel Resistance (Su)** The prismatic sphere at the center of the orrery (CL 20th) can be dispelled with a targeted dispel magic spell, but only temporarily. As the sphere is fueled by the elemental energies within the Prismatic Lantern's demiplane, it reappears after 1d3 rounds. While the prismatic sphere is inactive, the prismatic orrery cannot use its blinding pulse and prismatic refraction abilities.",
			"**Prismatic Refraction (Ex)** As a standard action, the prismatic orrery can position its many rings and lenses such that the magical energy of the prismatic sphere at its center is aimed in a series of beams at all targets within 60 feet. These beams take the form of a prismatic spray spell (CL 13th); determine the color of each ray randomly with a roll of 1d8 as indicated in the spell. A prismatic refraction ray is a ranged touch attack with a +17 bonus to hit and a save DC of 21. It takes the prismatic orrery 1d4 rounds to recalibrate its lenses to recharge this ability. The save DC is Dexterity-based."

			"**Divine Deception (Su)** Once per day while Shamira uses her change shape ability, she can choose to emulate a different alignment for the purpose of divination spells that reveal auras (such as detect evil). This effect persists as long as she carries a holy symbol of a deity of the same alignment she wishes to emulate. This holy symbol must have been given to her within the previous hour by a worshiper of that deity; Shamira typically secures these symbols via mind control. This effect last for 2d6 hours, after which point the holy symbol crumbles to ashes. While it lasts, spells and other magical effects treat her alignment as if it were the feigned alignment, not her true alignment of chaotic evil. If she uses a symbol of Sarenrae to appear neutral good, this effect lasts for 24 hours before the symbol crumbles to dust.",
			"**Dream Haunting (Su)** Shamira can use her energy drain attack, mind-affecting spell-like abilities, and profane benediction abilities on any creature she successfully affects with her nightmare spell-like ability while that ability is in effect. Once she uses one of these abilities against her target, the nightmare spell ends-she can only use one of these abilities per use of nightmare.",
			"**Energy Drain (Su)** Shamira's energy drain ability functions like that of a succubus, except that it drains 2 levels per use. As a free action as part of this attack, she may choose use her burn special attack with her energy drain. With a successful DC 36 Will save, a character resists the suggestion implanted by this attack, and a successful DC 36 Fortitude save negates the negative level after 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"**Fiery Passion (Su)** Shamira's passions and fires are one. A creature must be immune to both fire and mind-affecting effects in order to be immune to fire damage caused by Shamira. Creatures immune only to fire instead take fire damage as if they instead had fire resistance 10. Creatures with fire resistance and no immunity to mind-affecting effects take fire damage from Shamira's attacks as if they had no fire resistance.",
			"**Firebow (Su)** As a swift action, Shamira can conjure a +5 flaming burst unholy composite longbow that creates arrows as she fires it. In addition, arrows fired from her firebow can inflict her burn special attack.",
			"**Nascent Demon Lord Traits (Su)** In addition to many of the defenses and abilities incorporated into Shamira's statistics above, her weapons (natural and manufactured) are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction. Also, she can grant spells to her worshipers-she grants access to the domains of Chaos, Charm, Evil, and Nobility and the subdomains of Demon, Leadership, Love, and Lust.",
			"**Profane Benediction (Su)** This ability functions as the succubus's profane gift ability, except it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the target's choice rather than a +2 bonus. If the target is a worshiper of Sarenrae, the target also gains immunity to fire as long as the profane benediction persists, even if the worshiper at some point later abandons her faith in Sarenrae (as is often the case with those who are eager to keep their profane benedictions).",
			"**Summon Demons (Sp)** As a nascent demon lord, Shamira can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell."

Creatures with woodland stride or freedom of movement can move through this fungal bloom with ease. Living creatures within Treerazer's aura of corruption must make a DC 39 Fortitude save each round or their flesh grows pasty and clammy as tendrils of diseased plant matter and fungal growth sprout from it. This condition persists as long as the creature remains within Treerazer's aura of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected by control plants. The corruption does not otherwise impart plant traits to creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"**Defoliation (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Treerazer can exude a pulse of defoliating energy in a 30-foot-radius spread. This pulse appears as a wave of sickly green energy, and causes all plants and plant creatures in the area to blacken and wither. Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39 Fortitude save. A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or a shrub) doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. Treerazer can choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants and fungus. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"**Nascent Demon Lord Traits A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Treerazer's current exile to the Material Plane prevents him from achieving full demon lord status. Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits, which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here.",
			"- Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and compulsion effects, and poison.",
			"- Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.",
			"- Summon (Sp)** Once per day, nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.",
			"- Telepathy 300 ft.",
			"- A nascent demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.",
			"- Nascent demon lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the nascent demon lord's behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil-in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to the nascent demon lord's themes and interests."

			"**Overcharge Synapses (Su)** As a standard action, Tychilarius can overstimulate the nervous system of any creature that has taken Intelligence damage from Tychilarius's shatter mind ability. The target takes 15d6 points of electricity damage as every nerve in its body misfires. This damage can be reduced to half with a successful DC 32 Fortitude saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"**Plasma Bolt (Su)** As a standard action, Tychilarius can fire a bolt of plasma from one of its tentacles at a target within 300 feet (no range increment) as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit, a plasma bolt deals 15d6 points of damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.",
			"**Reform Flesh (Su)** Tychilarius can use the flesh and energy from a creature killed by its void maw ability to give birth to other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. It can create a number of such creatures whose total Hit Dice equal that of the creature killed by void maw. For example, if Tychilarius killed a 20th-level human wizard in its void maw, it could give birth to two nehthalggus (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 197). This process takes 24 hours.",
			"**Shatter Mind (Su)** Tychilarius exudes quivering psychic energy. Any creature adjacent to Tychilarius must succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"**Starflight (Su)** In outer space, Tychilarius can survive in the void and fly at an incredible speed. Its travel times vary, but a trip within a single solar system should take it 3d20 hours, and a trip farther than that should take it 3d20 days or more if Tychilarius knows the way to its destination.",
			"**Void Maw (Su)** When Tychilarius bites and successfully grabs a creature, it can attempt a combat maneuver check as a free action to draw the creature into its massive, chaotic form (as though attempting to pin the target). A creature drawn into Tychilarius's void maw must succeed at a DC 39 Will saving throw each round or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"Though this ability is similar to swallow whole, a creature in the maw can't cut its way out. Any creature in the area of a magic circle against evil or magic circle against chaos spell is unaffected by the confusion effect. A swallowed creature can escape by using plane shift or similar magic. Every day a creature remains in this void, it gains 1 negative level. A creature that dies from this effect is incorporated into Tychilarius's form; it can be reshaped into another creature via reform flesh, and is difficult to resurrect. Anyone attempting to resurrect a creature killed in the maw must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check to return the creature to life. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based."

A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means available. If the path leads it into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the victim receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based." ],

			"**Blasphemous Embrace (Ex)** If the Voice of the Damned grapples a foe, it can, as a swift action, cause its pages to flense the grappled creature. The pages deal the Voice of the Damned's swarm damage. If a creature takes any of this damage, it is subject to the swarm's distraction ability and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round. The Voice can have only one embraced target at a time, but it doesn't have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the Voice moves more than 5 feet from the pages or dismisses them (a free action), the pages are rendered inanimate. Any severe or stronger wind effect or any area attack that would damage a swarm ends the embrace.",
			"**Consume (Su)** If the Voice of the Damned begins its turn with an opponent in its blasphemous embrace, it can attempt a new combat maneuver check as though attempting to pin the opponent. If it succeeds, its foe takes swarm damage and vanishes into a nightmare realm within the Voice of the Damned. The target must be of Large size or smaller. The Voice of the Damned can't consume a creature that has the good subtype or that is affected by holy aura. A consumed creature takes 8d6 points of damage each round as it drifts within the Voice of the Damned's accumulated heresies. Nonevil creatures must also succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw each round or be affected as per the spell insanity, though any creature that is deafened or affected by silence or a similar effect is immune to the insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Each round on its turn, a consumed creature can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check as a full-round action. If the subject succeeds at this check on two consecutive turns, it escapes, emerging into a space adjacent to the Voice of the Damned. The Voice of the Damned cannot attempt to consume an escaped creature again until 24 hours have passed. A consumed creature can also escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Voice of the Damned is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all consumed creatures if a creature inside casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature (either inside or out) targets the Voice of the Damned with atonement, freedom, or holy word. The Voice of the Damned can expel any consumed creature as a move action, causing the victim to appear in any square adjacent to it.",
			"**Discorporate (Su)** The Voice of the Damned can collapse into a cyclone of pages as a free action. All its carried, held, and worn items fall to the ground, and its Strength score drops to 1. The Voice functions as a swarm of Diminutive creatures while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (though its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the Voice maintains its defensive abilities. It loses its claw, slam, and wing natural attacks, but it can make a swarm attack and use its spell-like abilities. The Voice of the Damned can reform into its true form as a full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.",
			"**Malevolence (Su)** As an immediate action, the Voice of the Damned can attempt to merge its body with a creature it has consumed. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 25th), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 32 Will saving throw. If the creature fails, the Voice of the Damned vanishes and the possessed creature reappears in its space (along with any other creatures the Voice had consumed). A creature that successfully saves is immune to the Voice's malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"**Master of Symbols (Su)** The Voice of the Damned can speak, read, and write all languages, as per the spell tongues. It casts any spell with the word \"symbol\" in its name as though its casting time were a standard action, and once per day it can cast symbol of death as a swift action. Additionally, it does not need a surface on which to inscribe symbols-they merely float in the air for their duration.",
			"**Tenacious (Ex)** The Voice gains a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD.",
			"**Wracking Gaze (Su)** The Voice of the Damned has a gaze attack with a range of 50 feet that deals 8d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage. A creature that succeeds at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage but not the physical damage. The save DC is Constitution-based."

Those damaged by his melee attacks or by fire effects that allow no save are instead sickened for 1 round per attack. This duration stacks.",

Zelishkar can dim his flames to burning black shadows as a free action, suppressing the dazzling effect and allowing him to use Stealth without penalty.",

In addition, if Zelishkar succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver, as a swift action he can suppress any fire resistance or immunity the target possesses until the beginning of Zelishkar's next turn. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this effect, unless that subtype is granted by a temporary magical effect or magic item."
