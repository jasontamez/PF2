		"**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can sabotage an item worn by a foe with a special sunder combat maneuver. You use this maneuver in melee to sabotage an item that is neither held nor hidden in a bag, pack, or other container. You must have at least one hand free to perform this combat maneuver, and doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature against whom you are performing the maneuver, even though you have the Improved Sunder feat.",

Any bonuses on combat maneuver checks specifically to sunder (such as the bonus granted by Improved Sunder) also apply to this maneuver, and any bonuses your target gains to CMD against sundering attempts also protect her from this maneuver. If you succeed at the check, instead of dealing damage, you sabotage the chosen item, causing it to gain the broken condition. If the item was already broken, you instead destroy the item or cause it to fall off. Items immune to sunder are also immune to this special combat maneuver, and this still can't destroy or remove an item such as an artifact that can normally be destroyed or removed only by specific means.",

		"**Benefit:** Select one specific category of spirit (fey, outsiders, or undead). Once per day as a standard action, you can condemn these spirits with such force of will that you can drive them from hosts, unravel their magic, or damage them physically. A rebuke targets a single spirit you can see (or one that is possessing a creature you can see) within 30 feet.",
		"Rebuking a spirit either functions as a targeted dispel magic spell or channels damaging energy directly into the creature, similar to a cleric's channel energy ability. To dispel a spirit's magic, attempt a dispel check, using your character level as your caster level (DC = 11 + spell level); if you're successful, that effect is dispelled. You can dispel only spells and spell-like abilities affecting the spirit itself or a creature it is currently possessing. If you use this dispel effect to end a spirit's possession of a creature or object, you gain a +2 bonus on this check. Channeling damaging energy instead deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 character levels you have. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Charisma modifier) halves this damage.",
		"**Special:** You can select this feat up to three times. Each time you do, you must select a different category of spirit your rebuke can affect, and you can use the feat one additional time each day."

While conversing with the spirit, you can attempt Diplomacy checks to change its attitude toward you, as a normal use of that skill. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature, you gain a +4 bonus on these Diplomacy checks.

If the height you clear with that check exceeds the creature's height, you jump over it and continue your charge on the opposite side. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity.

		"**Benefit:** When you brew a potion, you can brew it in such a way that when exposed suddenly to air and force, it diffuses into a cloud of vapor that can be inhaled. The potion can still be consumed normally, but it can also be delivered by throwing it at another creature as a splash weapon. The potion vial has a range increment of 10 feet and is considered an improvised weapon. On impact, the vial breaks and a cloud of barely visible potion vapor fills the square it lands in (this vapor does not obscure normal sight in any way). If a creature is in that square, it gains the benefits of the potion immediately as though it had imbibed the potion.",
		"Otherwise, the vapor persists for 1d3+1 rounds in only that square before dissipating, and the first creature to enter the square before the vapor dissipates gains the potion's benefits. A creature entering the vapor's space can hold its breath to refrain from inhaling the potion. No more than one creature can benefit from a potion's vapor, and if more than one creature is in the potion's space after it is thrown, the potion is wasted and has no effect. The thrown potion deals no damage to creatures or objects it hits. A spell brewed into a potion this way does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.",
		"Versatile Brewing",
		"The above feat allows potion brewers to concoct unusual variations in their potions, altering the potions' effects in strange and useful ways. This feat functions similarly to metamagic feats, though it affects the creation of potions instead of the normal casting of spells.
