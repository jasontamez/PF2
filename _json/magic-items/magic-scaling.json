			"Despite the fact that they are millennia old, these polished metal armbands, inlaid with intricate patterns in gold and platinum, are in remarkable condition. Part of a cache of Azlanti artifacts discovered by Arustun in the Cave of Tiandra in approximately -4160 ar, the bracers became a treasured possession of the Jistka Imperium's founder and a valuable tool in his decadeslong quest to recover and interpret remnants of Azlanti and Thassilonian culture.",
			"Each of the bracers has one slot in which an ioun stone can be embedded. An ~`ioun stone`~ embedded in this manner grants the bearer its normal benefits as if it were orbiting her head and resonates its powers as if it were slotted in a ~`wayfinder`~. Additionally, as long as at least one ioun stone is slotted into the bracers, the wearer can understand any written language, as per ~`comprehend languages`~.",

This ability does not reveal whether the item is cursed unless the wearer's character level is equal to or greater than the caster level of the item."
