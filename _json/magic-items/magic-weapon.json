Weapons steeped in enchantment and illusion magic, for example, held great power over wielders of transmutation. Such weapons were often banned in Thassilon, so wary were the runelords of their propagation, yet all seven kept champions and assassins armed with runeforged weapons targeting their enemies' weaknesses in secret.",

All runeforged weapons are, to a certain degree, empathic. They enhance sin or virtue in those who wield them, so a fighter armed with a dominant weapon becomes more domineering than before, for example. Anyone wielding a runeforged weapon takes a -2 penalty on all Diplomacy checks, as her vices or virtues are magnified at the expense of personality. No weapon can have more than one runeforged weapon quality at a time, and a creature that carries two runeforged weapons (even those o f the same type) takes a -5 penalty on all attack rolls, Will saving throws, and skill checks, as her mind is constantly assailed by multiple empathic urges.",

The seven correct component combinations and the type of runeforged weapon each combination creates are listed below.

It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small transformative greatsword can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the -2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a keen transformative weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the keen special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon.

Pulling a lever on the crossbow as a move action extends and retracts the weapon's stock and opens and collapses its limbs for easy stowage, making it small enough for a Medium character to carry in a backpack. The crossbow can be enchanted with weapon abilities like any normal masterwork crossbow.",

While using the crossbow in this way, a character without ~`Exotic Weapon Proficiency (repeating heavy crossbow)`~ doesn't take a penalty for nonproficiency. While the crossbow is thus mounted, the apparatus can't make attacks with the pincers. If a character operates the lever that extends and retracts the pincers and feelers while the crossbow is mounted, the apparatus ejects the crossbow instead, enabling the vehicle to make pincer attacks again."

Although a wizard hook does not allow for fine manipulation, it is infused with magic that bolsters somatic components-you can use a hand stump outfitted with a wizard hook to fulfill any somatic components for casting arcane spells. A wizard hook also grants proficiency in its use as a weapon. You can make touch attacks with spells using a wizard hook, either by making a normal attack with the hook (in which case it deals normal hook hand damage plus the spell effect), or by making a touch attack with the hook (in which case you gain a +4 bonus on the attack roll and the save DC of the spell increases by +1, but you do not do hook hand damage)."

A creature with the ability to channel negative energy can expend one use of that ability to charge the weapon with power, causing one onyx gem per 1d6 points of channeled energy to glow (multiple channels do not stack; the wielder must be able to channel 5d6 points of negative energy to activate all five gems). Anytime the wielder deals damage to a creature with the scythe, he can activate one charged gem as a swift action, releasing its energy and dealing 1d6 points of channeled negative energy damage to the target. Alternatively, as a standard action the wielder can touch the scythe to a willing creature healed by negative energy (such as undead) and release any number of stored charges, each of which heals the target for 1d6 points of damage."

Ranged shadowcraft weapons that use ammunition create their own projectiles out of shadow, but they can be loaded with and fire other types of ammunition, as well.",
			"The wielder of a shadowcraft weapon can alter the weapon's shape as a standard action simply by picturing the form she wishes it to assume. A shadowcraft weapon can assume the form of any masterwork weapon that shares its type and handedness, regardless of its categorization as simple, martial, or exotic. Shadowcraft weapons are able to take the shape of weapons of different size categories, as long as they would be treated as the appropriate level of handedness for the shadowcraft weapon's true size. For example, a Medium two-handed melee shadowcraft weapon can become a greatsword sized for a Medium creature, or a longsword sized for a Large creature (which a Medium creature would treat as a two-handed weapon).",
			"Shadowcraft weapons are quasi-real and deal less damage if an opponent realizes this. The first time each round that a creature is hit with a shadowcraft weapon, that creature can attempt a Will saving throw to disbelieve (DC = 15 + twice the weapon's enhancement bonus, if any). On a failed check, the weapon deals damage normally. On a successful save, all of the weapon's attacks against that creature do minimum damage until the wielder's next turn, and that creature gains a +4 bonus on subsequent saving throws to disbelieve the attacks of that wielder's shadowcraft weapon. Shadowcraft weapons deal only 1 point of damage to objects. In addition, the wielder of a shadowcraft weapon gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and adds +1 to the save DC to disbelieve the attack if the opponent is in an area of dim light or darkness. In contrast, the wielder takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and to the save DC to disbelieve the attack if the opponent is in an area of bright light.",
			"A shadowcraft weapon can be enhanced like any other masterwork weapon and it retains all of its abilities between transformations, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a keen shadowcraft weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the keen special ability while in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. A shadowcraft weapon retains the last appearance it was commanded to assume until its wielder commands it to assume a different form."

A spellcaster can store a single spell of any level with the cold descriptor and a casting time of one standard action in Emberchill. The wielder can use the stored spell to counterspell any spell with the fire descriptor, provided that the stored cold spell is 1 or more levels higher than the target fire spell (unless the cold spell specifically counters the fire spell). The wielder must still ready an action and succeed at a Spellcraft check to identify the spell to counterspell it. Once stored in the weapon, the cold spell cannot be used for any other purpose, but the wielder can harmlessly discharge the stored spell as a swift action to make room for another spell. Abilities that grant the cold descriptor to spells, such as the frozen caress hex of the winter witch archetype, make those spells suitable for storing within Emberchill."

If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a -4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the returning property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as true strike) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks for that round."
