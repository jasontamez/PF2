While her enemies tire around her, the wearer of this armor can keep fighting. If the wearer is a barbarian, the armor of the tireless warrior allows her to rage for 2 additional rounds per day. Once per day on command, the wearer can cause her enemies to become fatigued, as per the waves of fatigue spell. In addition, once per day, the wearer can draw upon the armor's strength to banish her own weariness. For 10 minutes, the wearer takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. This effect is merely an illusion, however, and when it ends, the wearer takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and the condition or conditions return."

In addition, the armor stores the kinetic energy from blows made against it. Once the armor has negated 15 total points of damage, the wearer can release the stored energy as a swift action against a single creature within 10 feet. This energy takes the form of a force effect, and the wearer must make an attack roll at his base attack bonus +10. The energy deals 15 points of force damage to the target, and the target must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If the wearer chooses not to release this energy, the armor still provides damage reduction but absorbs no more energy until the stored energy is released."

On command, the wearer of this shield can take 1 point of Wisdom drain to banish a single creature within 30 feet into the Dark Tapestry. The target of this ability must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be teleported into the airless void of space. The target can attempt a new saving throw as a full-round action each round to return. While banished in this way, the target takes 3d6 points of cold damage per round and must hold its breath or begin to suffocate. If the Wisdom damage is negated or does not occur, the ability does not function. If the Wisdom drain is healed, any banished creature returns, and the shield becomes permanently nonmagical."
