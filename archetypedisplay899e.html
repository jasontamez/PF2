Even the loudest voice can often times be drowned out by the din of battle. Whether with the polished metal trumpet of a standing army or the crude curved animal horn of savage raiders, a herald of the horn sounds his raging song with thunderous blasts, which can bolster allies or shatter castle walls.

Arcane Bond (Ex):  At 1st level, a herald of the horn forms a powerful bond with a horn (musical instrument). This functions like an arcane bloodline sorcerer's arcane bond with an object. Like a weapon, wand, or staff, the horn must be held in one hand when the herald of the horn casts skald spells. This ability replaces Scribe Scroll.

Rousing Retort (Su):  At 5th level, a herald of the horn can use raging song to free allies from enchantment effects and fear. When beginning a raging song, he can expend 4 rounds of that ability to grant all allies within 60 feet a new saving throw against an ongoing enchantment or fear effect. The allies gain a +2 bonus on this new saving throw. This ability replaces the first daily use of spell kenning gained at 5th level.

Horn Call (Su):  At 7th level, a herald's horn enhances his sonic spells. If a skald spell with the sonic descriptor is cast using the horn, its DC increases by 1. These DCs increase by an additional 1 at 13th and 19th levels. This ability replaces lore master.

Crumbling Blast (Su):  At 11th level, a herald of the horn can use his horn to create a devastating shock wave of energy. Once per day, he can sound a note on the horn that functions like a horn of blasting (DC = 10 + 1/2 the herald of the horn's level + his Charisma bonus). At 17th level, the herald of the horn can use this ability twice per day and it functions like a greater horn of blasting. Unlike an actual horn of blasting, this ability does not carry the risk of destroying the horn. This ability replaces the second and third daily uses of spell kenning gained at 11th and 17th levels.

Rage Powers:  The following rage powers complement the herald of the horn archetype: battle roar*, energy absorption, energy eruption, fearless rage, knockback, knockdown, smasher, and swift foot. (Those with asterisks [*] are listed in the rage powers section above.)
