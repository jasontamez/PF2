Description

Runic engravings adorn this charred rib bone pulled from a slain troll. When the bone is tossed up to 20 feet away, it can grow into a fullsized troll (Bestiary 268) under the user's control on command. The troll normally remains for 2d4 rounds, but if the user is maintaining a bardic performance when the item is activated, the duration is extended until the end of the performance. When the troll is slain or the duration ends, it turns back into a bone that then crumbles into dust.
