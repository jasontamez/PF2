Berserker's Cry

Your cry of bloodthirsty fury inspires those around you to greater acts of violence.

Prerequisites: Cha 13, Linnorm Kings affinity.

Benefit: Once per day, as a move action, you may unleash a powerful, bloodthirsty scream of battle lust and fury. Allies within 60 feet who can hear your berserker's cry (including yourself ) are heartened and gain a +1 morale bonus on damage rolls made with melee attacks for a number of rounds equal to half your character level + your Charisma bonus. If you have the ability to rage, you may unleash a berserker's cry as part of the free action to enter a rage (instead of as a separate move action).

A creature may be under the effect of only one berserker's cry at a time.

Special: You may gain this feat multiple times. Every time you take this feat, you may unleash a berserker's cry one additional time per day.
