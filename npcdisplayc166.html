Tactics

Before Combat The paladin casts delay poison and resist energy (fire).
During Combat The paladin fights from horseback with his lance, positioning himself where he can attack the enemy leader using Spirited Charge. He uses Improved Overrun and Trample to pass and crush creatures in his way. If he is unhorsed and mounting again is dangerous or impractical, he casts holy sword on his mace and fights on foot.
Base Statistics Without delay poison and resist energy, the paladin's statistics are Immune charm, disease, fear; Resist none.

This holy warrior is a skilled rider who dispenses harsh justice at the point of a lance.

Velj Thundari

Velj Thundari feels at home only when riding a horse, and always seeks to improve his horsemanship. He spends so much time training with his steed that he often has a hard time interacting with people. Unlike his mount, people don't automatically react to his commands (especially since many of these are nonverbal cues),and he often sees their confusion as opposition. Commoners easily frustrate him, which makes him react with sarcasm. He values those people who see his wisdom, however, and is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to keep them safe.

Combat Encounters: Velj is comfortable fighting alone, leading a charge of mounted knights, or breaking through a wall of enemy defenders to reach their leader. If he grows frustrated with a PC, he might challenge that character to face him a nonlethal duel.

Roleplaying Suggestions:Velj is proud of his accomplishments and his paladin code. He becomes angry if he or his life's path is insulted.
