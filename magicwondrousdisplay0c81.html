Description

When this large, clear prism is held between the user and a text, it allows the user to read that text quickly and still obtain a complete understanding. The time needed to read any nonmagical text with a saccadic focusing prism is reduced to one-tenth the time the user would normally require. The time required to gain a benefit from any magical text (such as a tome of clear thought or a manual of war) is halved. This has no impact on the time required to learn spells or extracts from written sources.
