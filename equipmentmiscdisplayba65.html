Description

This drink is brewed by pouring boiling water through crushed, roasted coffee beans. Two cups is potent enough to reduce the penalties from the fatigued condition from -2 to -1 for 1 hour.

Brewing your own coffee requires ground coffee beans (5 cp for 1 pound of coffee beans, or 8 cp for 1 pound of ground beans) and a cooking device. You can boil the grounds in a pot, then pour the liquid after allowing the solids to settle, or filter the drink by pouring it through a sieve or cloth. Many travelers prefer the convenience of using a coffee pot (see page 62).
