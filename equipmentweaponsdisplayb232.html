Description

Short swords are some of the most common weapons found in any martial society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the region and creator. Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades can be curved or straight, single- or double-edged, and wide or narrow. Hilts may be ornate or simple, with crossguards, basket hilts, or no guard at all. Such weapons are often used on their own, but can also be paired as a matched set, or used in conjunction with a dagger or longer sword.
