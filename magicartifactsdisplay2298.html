Description

This staff functions as a staff of the magi, with several modifications. Its summon monster IX power can only summon elementals, and it has the following powers<ul><li>summon monster IV (elementals only, 1 charge)</li><li>elemental body IV (2 charges)</li><li>planar binding (elementals only, 2 charges)</li></ul>Whenever the staff is broken in a retributive strike, it automatically reforms, but can never again be wielded by its previous possessor. A wielder transported to another plane by a retributive strike always appears on an elemental plane, while the staff itself is sent to a different elemental plane moments after reforming.

Destruction

This item can be destroyed by having elementals from all four elemental planes (earth, air, fire, and water) attack it at the same time while it is broken in a retributive strike.
