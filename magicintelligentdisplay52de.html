Description

This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob
resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The
first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of
wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their
most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake
of greater power.

The bound apprentices’ intellects have no free will
but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal
circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands,
but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how
unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an
inanimate object-though few wielders care. While no good
creature would create a metamagician’s apprentice, he or
she can still wield one.

The rod can be used as a +1 light mace. On command, it
transforms into a +1/+1 quarterstaff or back to its rod form.

A metamagician’s apprentice knows four metamagic
feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels
higher than the spell’s actual level, such as Silent Spell and
Empower Spell) and acts as a greater metamagic rod for
those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a
spell at a time, though (like a metamagic rod) the wielder
can use his own feats and the rod’s on the same spell.

The rod can use read magic and detect magic at will.
The metamagician’s apprentice is never overwhelmed by
powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects
that require reading to activate (such as the explosive runes
spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on
three Knowledge skills; these skills are determined when the
rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in
that skill) and can never be changed. Knowledge (arcana) is
almost always one of these three skills.

A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with
other alignments exist.

If a metamagician’s apprentice becomes dominant after
a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free
its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can
be at peace.
