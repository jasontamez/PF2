Description

This glass jar contains a colony of carnivorous scavenger beetles. The beetles must be fed at least a quarter pound of meat per day or they die. When released on a dead organism, they break it down and devour its flesh in 1d4 days, leaving only bones. Scavenger beetles eat only dead flesh, and can't harm living creatures. Once released, the beetles can't be returned to the jar.
