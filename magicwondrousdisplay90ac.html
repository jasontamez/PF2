Description

The matte surface of this pitted gray helm seems to absorb light, rather than reflect it. The skull mask that serves as its visor is a constant reminder of the fate that awaits all mortals. The wearer of the helm is immune to fear effects but cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonuses.

A creature that comes within 20 feet of the wearer must succeed at a Will save (DC 14) or lose the benefit of morale bonuses while it remains in that area. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to this ability for 24 hours.
