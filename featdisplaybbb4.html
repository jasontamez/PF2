You are able to swing your tower shield around quickly.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplay846e.html?ItemName=Shield%20Focus">Shield Focus</a>, <a href="featdisplayb88d.html?ItemName=Tower%20Shield%20Proficiency">Tower Shield Proficiency</a>, base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: While using a tower shield, add the shield's bonus to AC (including its enhancement bonus) to your CMD against bull rush and overrun combat maneuvers. While using this style, you can use a tower shield to grant you total cover along one edge of your space (Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook 153) as a move action.
