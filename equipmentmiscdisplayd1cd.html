Description

This specialized bullseye lantern has a ruby lens that covers the original lens, providing a deep crimson hue to the lantern's light, allowing for more stealth when used in areas of darkness. This special lens can be set in place or removed as a swift action. While the ruby lens is in place, the lantern only provides dim light in a 60-foot cone. A dusk lantern's red light is imperceptible to creatures relying on darkvision as their sole form of sight.
