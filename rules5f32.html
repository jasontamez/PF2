Generating ability scores for most of the races you create with these rules-even advanced and monstrous races' uses the standard methods found on page 15 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. Races without Constitution scores are the exception, and require some slight changes to the ability score generation methods. The changes are as follows, corresponding to the five methods found in the Core Rulebook.

Standard: Roll 4d6, discarding the lowest result as normal, and sum the results, but only do this five times, and assign them as you see fit, skipping Constitution.

Classic: Roll 3d6 and sum the results five times, and assign them as you see fit, skipping Constitution. Heroic: Roll 2d6 and add 6 to the sum of each. Do this five times and assign them as you see fit, skipping Constitution.

Dice Pool: Instead of a pool of 24d6, races without Constitution get a pool of 20d6 to assign to the ability scores, except for Constitution. These characters still must assign a minimum of 3d6 in each of the other ability scores. Increase the number for high-powered games.

Purchase: When using the purchase method for ability scores, assume members of races without Constitution have a Constitution score of 10 and buy the rest of the abilities normally using the points allocated for the campaign's power level.
