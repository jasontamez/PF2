Description

A phaleros is a type of metal javelin that stores a splash weapon in a small cage between the haft and the spearhead. When a phaleros strikes its target, the spearhead compresses toward the haft and breaks the payload, showering the target with its contents as though you had struck the target's square with the splash weapon. On a critical hit, you instead treat the target as though it had suffered a direct hit from the splash weapon. A phaleros is reusable, and reloading one with a splash weapon is a process that takes two rounds and provokes attacks of opportunity.
