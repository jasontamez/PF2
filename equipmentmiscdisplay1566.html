Description

These polished metal spikes can aid you in performing a variety of rope work, including tying and untying knots, untangling things, splicing rope, or tensioning ropes. A typical spike is somewhere between 6 inches to a foot in length, has a slender and almost needle-like taper, and is blunted at both ends. Smaller spikes are worn on lanyards while a larger spike is kept in a sheath. A marlinspike grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Skill checks involving the use of a rope.
