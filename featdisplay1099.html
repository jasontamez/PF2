With careful, repeated blows, you weaken your foe's defenses.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a> with bludgeoning weapon.

Benefit: When you deal damage with a melee attack with a bludgeoning weapon to an opponent you have already damaged this round, you can also reduce the value of that target's damage reduction by 1 until the beginning of your next turn. This reduction stacks with itself.
