Description

These massive horseshoes sport deadly spikes that jut from their
front. Once per day on command, the rider of a mount wearing
these shoes may choose to either increase the mount's size
by one size increment (maximum Huge), or change its type to
magical beast, as beast shape IV. In addition, while the mount
is augmented in either of these two ways, it gains DR/5 chaos,
evil, good, or law (selected by the rider). These horseshoes are
part of a set and require all four to be worn by the same animal
to properly function.
