Your family traces its heritage back to the ocean depths, whether scions of undersea empires left in the wake of nomadic sea-tribes, or the spawn of creeping ichthyic infiltrators into remote seaside villages. The song of the sea hums in your blood, calling the waves and all those within to your command.

Bloodline Arcana: Whenever you cast a spell of the water type, your effective caster level is increased by one, and summoned creatures with a swim speed or the aquatic or water type gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls.

Bloodline Powers: Your seaborn magical talents awaken changes in you, both mystical and physical, as you develop your powers.

Dehydrating Touch (Sp): Starting at 1st level, you can make a melee touch attack as a standard action that inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess and sickens the target for 1 round. Oozes, plants, and creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes suffer lethal damage instead. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

Aquatic Adaptation (Ex): At 3rd level, you gain a swim speed of 30 feet. At 9th level, you gain the amphibious special quality and develop a fat layer that grants a +1 natural armor bonus and resist cold 5. When immersed in water, you gain blindsense 30 feet. At 15th level, you gain a swim speed of 60 feet and blindsense of 60 feet in water.

Aquatic Telepathy (Su): At 9th level, you gain telepathy (100 feet) and can communicate with creatures with a swim speed or the aquatic or water types regardless of intelligence. You may cast suggestion on such creatures a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. This ability is telepathic and does not require audible or visual components. At 15th level, once per day you can telepathically call and request a service from an aquatic, water, or swimming creature as if using demand or greater planar ally.

Raise the Deep (Sp): At 15th level, you raise water as per control water, but no water need be present. This created water is stationary and does not flow out of the area where you create it; it lasts 1 round per sorcerer level and then disappears. At 20th level, the dimensions of the effect are doubled. You may use this ability once per day.

Deep One (Ex): At 20th level, you gain blindsense 60 feet and your body is covered with fine, slippery scales granting DR 10/piercing, resist cold 20, and continuous freedom of movement. Underwater, you gain evasion and blindsight 120 feet, and you are immune to pressure damage from deep water.
