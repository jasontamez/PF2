Description

Generally stored in a glass vial, an antidote is formulated to counteract a specific poison chosen at the time of the antidote's creation. Drinking the antidote grants a +10 alchemical bonus on saving throws against that poison for 4 hours. If the imbiber succeeds at a saving throw with this bonus, she is automatically cured even if she would not normally be cured by successful saving throws or the number required to cure her has not been met yet. However, the antidote has no effect against other poisons. An antidote's price is half that of the poison it counteracts. An antidote has no effect against a magical poison. The Craft (alchemy) DC to create an antidote is equal to the save DC of the poison.
