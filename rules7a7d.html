A number of spells and magic items utilize extradimensional spaces, such as <a href="spelldisplay3f32.html?ItemName=rope%20trick">rope trick</a>, a <a href="magicwondrousdisplayb9e2-2.html?FinalName=https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Bag%20of%20HoldingType%20I">bag of holding</a>, a <a href="magicwondrousdisplaycef9.html?FinalName=Handy%20Haversack">handy haversack</a>, and a <a href="magicwondrousdisplay0b11.html?FinalName=Portable%20Hole">portable hole</a>. These spells and magic items create a tiny pocket space that does not exist in any dimension. Such items do not function, however, inside another extradimensional space. If placed inside such a space, they cease to function until removed from the extradimensional space. For example, if a bag of holding is brought into a rope trick, the contents of the bag of holding become inaccessible until the bag of holding is taken outside the rope trick. The only exception to this is when a bag of holding and a portable hole interact, forming a rift to the <a href="rulesd2cc.html?Name=Astral%20Plane&amp;Category=Esoteric%20Planes">Astral Plane</a>, as noted in their descriptions.
