A phantom with this emotional focus fixates on every task given as if it were the phantom's last. The most basic commands are treated as life-and-death situations, and the truly dangerous ones are faced with a resolve and tenacity that sometimes defies common sense. Zeal phantoms take the form of steadfast protectors or daring and manic creatures looking for the next challenge or opportunity to prove itself to either its master or itself. Often very prideful creatures, these phantoms display an orange aura upon completing their tasks. They are prone to boast about their accomplishments and chastise those around them for not accomplishing more.

Skills: The phantom gains a number of ranks in Acrobatics and Survival equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.

Good Saves: Fortitude and Reflex.

Tracking: The phantom adds half its number of Hit Dice (minimum 1) to Survival skill checks to follow tracks.

Ruthless Combatant (Su): The phantom threatens a critical hit with its slam attacks on a roll of 19-20. When the spiritualist reaches 11th level, the phantom's critical modifier with slam attacks increases to ??3. This doesn't stack with Improved Critical or similar effects.

Determination Aura (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, as a swift action, the phantom can emit a 20-footradius aura that grants its zeal to nearby allies. Allies within the aura gain a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls and saving throws. The phantom can use this ability in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form.

Steadfast Servant (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom can stay manifested even when its spiritualist master is unconscious or asleep.

Zeal's Resolve (Su): When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, three times per day as a free action, when the phantom misses with an attack roll or fails a saving throw, it can reroll the failed attack or saving throw. It must take the new result, even if that result is worse.
