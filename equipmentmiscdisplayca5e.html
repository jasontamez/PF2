Flying straps

Source   80 gp (masterwork),  10 gp (standard); Weight 10 lbs. (masterwork), 10 lbs. (standard)

Description

These crude straps are used to secure a goblin or other small creature to the underside of a dire bat (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 30) or giant vulture (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 3 284). These straps count as an exotic riding saddle. If the mount fails a Fly check, there's a 50% chance the straps break and the rider falls. Masterwork flying straps count as an exotic military saddle, and don't have a chance to break if the mount fails a Fly check.
