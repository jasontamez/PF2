You can choke foes with a lasso.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (lasso)</a>, <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus (lasso).</a>

Benefit:  When you successfully entangle a creature with a lasso (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 178) and beat the target's CMD by 5 or more, the target cannot speak above a whisper and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + your CMB + the spell level) to cast a spell with a verbal component, use a command word item, or use any magic requiring speech. Additionally, the DC of an Escape Artist check to slip free of a lasso you are using equals 15 or your CMD, whichever is higher.
