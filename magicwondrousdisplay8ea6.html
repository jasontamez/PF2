Description

Loadstone studs line the straps of this ornate leather harness.
When worn by an eidolon, the bindings act as a dimensional
safety harness, anchoring the outsider to its current plane. Any
time the eidolon would be forced to return to its home plane
(such as when it's reduced to negative hit points equal to its
Constitution score or when its master is rendered unconscious),
it can expend one use of its summoner's summon monster spelllike
ability as a free action to remain on the Material Plane for
1 round. The summoner does not need to be conscious for the
eidolon to use this ability, but he must be within 100 feet. If the
summoner is conscious, he can refuse to allow this expenditure
(which means the eidolon is forced back to its home plane).


If the condition that would have sent the eidolon back to
its home plane is still in effect after 1 round has passed, the
eidolon may expend another use of its master's summon
monster spell-like ability; otherwise it immediately returns to
its home plane.
