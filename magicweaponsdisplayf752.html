Description

This small cast-iron cauldron has ring handles and three latches that can secure the lid in place. While the pot can be used for cooking and brewing potions, when gripped by the handles, it can also be wielded as a +1 heavy mace without imposing an improvised weapon penalty. As a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a potion can be sealed inside the cauldron, destroying the potion and infusing the iron with its magic. As a free action when he successfully strikes a creature with the battlepot, the wielder can inject the stored potion into the target, treating the struck creature as if it had just consumed the potion. Up to five potions can be stored in a battlepot at a time, but only one potion can be expended per successful hit; the wielder decides which potion is discharged with each blow.
