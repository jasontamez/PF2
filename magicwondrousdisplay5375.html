Description

This wayfinder is made of magically
hardened glass, through which the
complex inner matrix of the compass
can be seen. Once per day, the
wielder of a wayfinder of the planes
can choose one of the following
alignments: chaotic, evil, good, or
lawful. For 1 hour thereafter, the wayfinder of the planes creates
a magic circle effect against the chosen alignment, centered on
the wayfinder. Once selected, the alignment of the magic circle
effect can't be changed until the effect recharges the next day.
