Description

These iron crossbow bolts have resin tips that break when the bolts strike their targets; inside the tip is a dose of injury or contact poison. In addition to dealing damage normally, anyone struck by a poison bolt is exposed to the poison. When using a poison bolt, you do not risk poisoning yourself, but the tip affects the bolt's accuracy; double all range increment penalties when using poison bolts. The bolt's cost does not include the cost of the poison, which must be included during creation.
