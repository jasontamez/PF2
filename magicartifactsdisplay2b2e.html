Description

Since Belimarius's runewell is defective, her runewell amulet is not as powerful as those worn by certain other runelords. It grants a +5 enhancement bonus to her natural armor. In addition, she can fly at a speed of 60 feet with perfect maneuverability and gains fast healing 10.

Destruction

If Belimarius's defective runewell is destroyed, this amulet is destroyed as well.
