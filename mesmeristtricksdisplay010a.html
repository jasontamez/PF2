Spectral Smoke - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay010a.html?ItemName=Spectral%20Smoke">Spectral Smoke</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 42</a>): A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a 10-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level. The cloud functions as fog cloud, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The radius of the cloud increases by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.
