Description

One of the most infamous
devices to evolve as a result of
trench warfare, the flamethrower is still
in its infancy in the early twentieth century.
The British military produced the Lawrence
1917, which found its way into the hands of
Russia’s soldiers. The device consists
of a cumbersome backpack
of two tanks and a swivelmounted,
handheld projection
unit, or "lance." When the device
is aimed and a small hand lever
depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is
propelled forth in a blazing stream of intense flame. A
f lamethrower with full tanks is capable of unleashing up
to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect.

When using a flamethrower, the wielder projects a
60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll
against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes
a –2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified
by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as
Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or
smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not
foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical
hit, the wielder confirms the critical for that roll alone.

All affected creatures take 4d6 points of damage,
and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also
succeed at succeed at a DC 20 Ref lex save or catch fire,
taking an additional 2d6 points of damage each round
until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature
can attempt a new save as a full-round action, and
dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2 bonus
on this save.

The device’s tanks and backpacks are awkward, and the
wielder takes a –4 armor check penalty when wearing the
cumbersome device. In addition, the tanks have hardness
10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured in the
presence of any adjacent flame (including the device’s own
gas igniter), a mighty conf lagration erupts, the wielder
takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and all creatures within a
20-foot radius take 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20
for half ). Any creatures who take damage must succeed at a
DC 20 Reflex save or catch on fire.
