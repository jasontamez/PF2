Description

Created by an ancient fey queen who could
see the threads of fate, this intelligent,
magical construct bird is made of bones
fused by alchemy and magic. Though it
takes the shape of a bird constructed of
alchemically hardened and magically enhanced bone, its stats
and abilities are similar to that of a clockwork spy (Bestiary 3 58)
except that it has perfect maneuverability and DR 20/-.

A creature wishing to use this artifact must be neither good
nor evil and must spend at least 24 hours with the magpie in
its possession. Once it does so, the magpie serves its bearer
until it is dismissed, its master commits an evil or good act that
requires atonement, or the magpie is destroyed.

Furthermore, the weird queen’s magpie has the following
abilities.
<ul><li>Three times per day on command, and while in contact with
the artifact, the bird’s bearer can use it as a pearl of power
(see page 314), but the spell recalled can be of any level.
</li><li>At will and on command, the bird’s master can make it go
forth and send messages, as if it were the subject of an
animal messenger spell.
</li><li>Three times per day on command, the bird’s master can have
the magpie cast breath of life.</li></ul>

Destruction

The weird queen’s magpie is destroyed if it enters the Positive
Energy Plane.
