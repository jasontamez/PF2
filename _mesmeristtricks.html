Mesmerist Tricks


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures</a>
A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).

To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it-but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.

Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier.

The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick's description, a mesmerist can't choose a particular trick more than once.

<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay3322.html?ItemName=Astounding%20Avoidance">Astounding Avoidance</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 40</a>): The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. If the mesmerist is 12th level or higher, the subject takes only half damage if she fails her save. The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.</td>

<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay5bd8.html?ItemName=Break%20Stupor">Break Stupor</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 18</a>): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject is under an effect such as the fascinated condition or magical slumber as per the sleep spell that would be ended by the subject taking damage or by an obvious threat. The trick sends a momentary phantom threat and sensation of pain, ending the effect. This ability works fast enough to prevent a sleeping creature from falling prone or dropping what it is holding, if the mesmerist uses it immediately. The mesmerist can also trigger the trick if the subject becomes confused as per confusion, but if he does so, the subject attacks the mesmerist on its next turn, as if the mesmerist attacked the subject.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay57b0.html?ItemName=Chain%20of%20Eyes">Chain of Eyes</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 12</a>): The subject can share her senses with the mesmerist. The mesmerist triggers chain of eyes by closing his eyes and concentrating on the implanted subject, allowing the mesmerist to see and hear everything the target experiences with her own senses of sight and hearing (including any special senses or magical effects). Once triggered, chain of eyes lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until the mesmerist shifts his field of vision back to himself as a free action. While viewing events from the target's perspective, the mesmerist is flat-footed, even if he can see himself from another perspective.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay6a6f.html?ItemName=Compel%20Alacrity">Compel Alacrity</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 40</a>): A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move 10 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The distance the subject can move increases by 5 feet for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay285f.html?ItemName=Enchanting%20Words">Enchanting Words</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 18</a>): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject attempts a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to adjust a creature's attitude. The subject can use the mesmerist's Charisma modifier instead of her own Charisma modifier on the check. If the subject uses Intimidate, the adjustment in attitude lasts an additional number of minutes equal to 10 ?? the mesmerist's Charisma modifier (minimum of 10 additional minutes).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay2cd4.html?ItemName=False%20Flanker">False Flanker</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 40</a>): A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay17f2.html?ItemName=Fearsome%20Guise">Fearsome Guise</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 40</a>): A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as disguise self. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplayf7af.html?ItemName=Fleet%20in%20Shadows">Fleet in Shadows</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 16</a>): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the target enters an area with dim or darker light. The subject can move double its normal speed (up to an additional 30 feet) for 1 round, but only while moving through areas of dim or darker light. Additionally, the subject can move at its normal speed and use the bonus speed from this trick in areas of total darkness, even if it cannot see.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay55fc.html?ItemName=Gift%20of%20Will">Gift of Will</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 40</a>): A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay3536.html?ItemName=Levitation%20Buffer">Levitation Buffer</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from hostile levitation (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 231). Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay92d5.html?ItemName=Life%20Revier">Life Revier</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9oo8?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Blood-of-the-Beast">Blood of the Beast pg. 19</a>): The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts an Intelligence or Knowledge check to remember a previous experience. The subject receives flashes of her entire life up to this point. She can use the mesmerist's Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier on the check, and she can attempt the check untrained. The subject cannot learn information that she has not previously read, heard, or otherwise experienced at some point during her life when using this ability.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay33f5.html?ItemName=Linked%20Reaction">Linked Reaction</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either the subject or the mesmerist is surprised and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay111d.html?ItemName=Mask%20Misery">Mask Misery</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of that condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. If the mesmerist is 6th level or higher, he adds the moderate conditions to the conditions he can ignore with this trick, and this trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplaybfe6.html?ItemName=Meek%20Facade">Meek Facade</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. The bonus to AC increases by 1 for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplayb4ab.html?ItemName=Mesmeric%20Mirror">Mesmeric Mirror</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. One duplicate of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as mirror image). For every 5 class levels the mesmerist possesses, one additional image appears, to a maximum of five images at 20th level. Each image lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplaya491.html?ItemName=Mesmeric%20Pantomime">Mesmeric Pantomime</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): By orchestrating the movement of his ally's body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a morale bonus on the check equal to the mesmerist's Charisma bonus, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay4a65.html?ItemName=Misdirection">Misdirection</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay2081.html?ItemName=Psychic%20Impression">Psychic Impression</a> (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 9</a>): Objects retain psychic impressions of those who come in contact with them, and a powerful mind can read these impressions. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject touches an object that another creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or more has touched in the last 10 minutes. The mesmerist receives a psychic impression of the emotional state of the last such creature to touch the object. This impression contains no images or languages and can't show the mesmerist who the creature was if the mesmerist doesn't already know.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay1c02.html?ItemName=Psychosomatic%20Surge">Psychosomatic Surge</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay972e.html?ItemName=Reflect%20Fear">Reflect Fear</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 16</a>): The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a fear effect or is the target of an Intimidate check to demoralize it. When the trick is triggered, the subject suppresses the fear effect that triggered the trick for 1d4 rounds, and any creature that caused this effect must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the effect's duration. If the duration of the reflect fear trick is longer than the fear effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the fear effect at all.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplayd377.html?ItemName=Reflection%20of%20Weakness">Reflection of Weakness</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay6fbb.html?ItemName=See%20in%20Darkness">See in Darkness</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 16</a>): The subject gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet for 1 minute. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into an area of darkness.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay13da.html?ItemName=Shadow%20Splinter">Shadow Splinter</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 42</a>): The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by an amount equal to 3 + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay23e9.html?ItemName=Slip%20Bonds">Slip Bonds</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 12</a>): While implanted with this trick, the subject gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks. If the subject becomes grappled, pinned, shackled, or otherwise personally restrained, the mesmerist can trigger the trick and cause the subject to become incorporeal just long enough to slip her bonds (unless they can otherwise restrain an incorporeal creature). This effect doesn't last long enough for the subject to move through walls or other barriers. If the mesmerist is 12th level, the subject remains incorporeal until the beginning of the mesmerist's next turn.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay010a.html?ItemName=Spectral%20Smoke">Spectral Smoke</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 42</a>): A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a 10-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level. The cloud functions as fog cloud, but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The radius of the cloud increases by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay754f.html?ItemName=Telepathic%20Link">Telepathic Link</a> (<a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq01wom">Heroes of Golarion pg. 9</a>): The subject can communicate telepathically with the mesmerist during a crisis. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject and her allies are outnumbered in combat. For 1 minute per mesmerist level, the subject and the mesmerist can communicate telepathically. If the subject and the mesmerist are more than a medium distance (100 feet + 10 feet per level) apart, the telepathic connection is severed and cannot be regained unless the trick is implanted again. The mesmerist and the subject must share a language to be able to communicate.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay96c7.html?ItemName=Umbral%20Shield">Umbral Shield</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 16</a>): The subject ignores any harmful effects of bright light or sunlight for 1 minute. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject would be exposed to harmful bright light (such as sunlight is to a vampire). The subject is immune to the dazzled condition while this trick is in effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay2002.html?ItemName=Unwitting%20Messenger">Unwitting Messenger</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 12</a>): The mesmerist describes a recipient to the subject while implanting this trick, then recites a verbal message no longer than five words per mesmerist level. The subject of unwitting messenger has no memory of the message or the target recipient. When the subject encounters the specified recipient, she repeats the message verbatim, but does not recall speaking the message or its contents. The message remains buried in the subject's subconscious for 24 hours, after which time it disappears if not delivered. The subject of unwitting messenger can be fooled by mundane disguises or illusions, causing her to deliver the message to the wrong recipient.</td>

<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay8ffa.html?ItemName=Vanish%20Arrow">Vanish Arrow</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 42</a>): With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.</td>

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw to disbelieve a sight-based illusion effect, but only so long as the mesmerist is not affected by or has disbelieved the illusion himself. The subject receives an insight bonus on her saving throw to disbelieve the illusion equal to the mesmerist's Charisma modifier. This trick cannot be used for illusions that do not allow a saving throw.</td>

Masterful Tricks


Description Source: <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures</a>
At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.


<table class="table">

<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay393a.html?ItemName=Allay%20Pain">Allay Pain</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9hdt?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Occult-Realms">Occult Realms pg. 16</a>): The subject of this trick gains DR 15/- against one attack that deals nonlethal damage. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject is hit with an attack that deals nonlethal damage.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay77c6.html?ItemName=Avian%20Escape">Avian Escape</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 43</a>): The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemy's attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as beast shape III). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a raven (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 133). This is a polymorph effect.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay8d4c.html?ItemName=Cursed%20Sanction">Cursed Sanction</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 43</a>): A ward curses an enemy who attacks the subject. While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject's forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplay1a54.html?ItemName=Faked%20Death">Faked Death</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 44</a>): The subject appears to die, but actually can stealthily move about. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall down dead (as programmed image), but actually turns invisible (as invisibility) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until she attacks. Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer.</td>

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins its turn grappled or under an effect that impedes its movement (including paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web). The subject gains the benefits of freedom of movement for 1 minute.</td>

A mesmerist must have the mask misery mesmerist trick to take greater mask misery.</td>

<td><a href="mesmeristtricksdisplayc38a.html?ItemName=Mental%20Fallback">Mental Fallback</a> (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 44</a>): Mental commands placed deep in the subject's mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by charm monster cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.</td>

The subject gains total concealment from all enemies (50% miss chance) as long as it remains within areas of dim or darker light. Against creatures with darkvision, the subject gains concealment (20% miss chance) rather than total concealment. Once triggered, this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters an area of normal or brighter light.</td>

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself. This is a conjuration (teleportation) effect.</td>

When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square. The enemy's spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist's spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it.</td>

After this trick ends, the subject is staggered for 1 round.</td>

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject hits with an attack using a weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike. The attack's target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, the target doesn't get a saving throw.</td>

When the subject attempts to lie, the mesmerist can trigger this trick. That particular lie resists truth-detecting magic, and creatures attempting to use such magic must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the mesmerist's class level to succeed; failure means the magic doesn't detect the subject's lie or force her to speak only the truth.</td>
