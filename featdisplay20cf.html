You can build robots.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplaya278.html?ItemName=Craft%20Technological%20Arms%20and%20Armor">Craft Technological Arms and Armor</a>, <a href="featdisplaya0c8.html?ItemName=Craft%20Technological%20Item">Craft Technological Item</a>, <a href="featdisplay7f89.html?ItemName=Technologist">Technologist</a>, Craft (mechanical) 9 ranks, Knowledge (engineering) 9 ranks.

Benefit:  You can create robots, provided you have access to a robotics lab and the necessary materials. A robot's price is equal to its CR ?? 20,000 gp, and the cost to create one is half this amount. Creating a robot takes 1 day for every 1,000 gp of its price. At the end of the process you must attempt a single Craft (mechanical) skill check to finish the robot. Failing this check means that the robot doesn't function and the materials and time are wasted. The DC for this skill check is equal to 20 + the robot's CR (minimum 21). A newly created robot has average hit points for its Hit Dice.

Special:  A robotics lab is required to craft robots and uses 200 charges each day it is in operation. See page 16 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Technology Guide for more information on technological laboratories.
