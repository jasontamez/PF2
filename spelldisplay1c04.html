Description

This spell disrupts the method a target uses for movement. Creatures under the effects of this spell move at half their base speed (rounded down to the nearest 5-foot increment) but can still take 5-foot steps as normal. Incorporeal creatures and creatures flying with perfect maneuverability are immune to the effects of this spell. Each round, a target receives another save to end the effect.
