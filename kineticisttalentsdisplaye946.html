Saving Throw Will negates
Your kinetic blast is so bright that it blinds your foes. Whenever an infused blast hits a foe and penetrates its spell resistance, that foe must succeed at a Will save or be blinded for 1 round, regardless of whether it takes damage from the blast. You can reduce the blast's damage by half to increase the DC of this save by 2.
