A character who chooses <a href="classdisplay8c2d.html?ItemName=Druid">druid</a> as her secondary class gains the following secondary class features.

Code: At 1st level, she gains Druidic as a bonus language and must abide by the druidic code of conduct-respecting nature, not teaching the Druidic language to outsiders, not wearing metal armor, and so on.

Wild Empathy: At 3rd level, she gains wild empathy, treating her character level as her effective druid level.

Companion: At 7th level, she gains an <a href="classdisplay4c10.html?ItemName=Companion">animal companion</a> as a druid of her character level - 4. No ability other than Improved Companion can ever increase her effective druid level for this purpose.

Improved Companion: At 11th level, her animal companion increases to that of a druid of her full character level.

Wild Shape: At 15th level, she gains the ability to use wild shape to turn into a Small or Medium animal two times per day for up to 1 hour per character level each time.

Greater Wildshape: At 19th level, her wild shape improves to include the 6th-level druid options, and she can use wild shape three times per day.
