You have become very proficient at using your net to hinder your enemies.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net)</a>, <a href="featdisplay4c17.html?ItemName=Net%20Adept">Net Adept</a>, <a href="featdisplaya968.html?ItemName=Net%20Maneuvering">Net Maneuvering</a>, base attack bonus +6.

Benefit:  In place of one of your melee attacks, you can use your net to attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver to blind an opponent (Advanced Player's Guide 320). If you have an opponent entangled in your net, you can attempt to trip that opponent as long as he is within your net's reach or you control the trailing rope on your net. You also gain a +2 bonus on drag and reposition combat maneuver checks you make using your net.

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, you can dazzle or sicken the opponent with a dirty trick combat maneuver instead of blinding it.
