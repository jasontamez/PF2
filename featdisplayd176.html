The weight of your blows overwhelms your opponents.

Prerequisites: Str 13, <a href="featdisplayc967.html?ItemName=Intense%20Blows">Intense Blows</a>, <a href="featdisplaycb33.html?ItemName=Power%20Attack">Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +11 or fighter level 8th, armor training class feature, proficiency with heavy armor.

Benefit: If you hit a creature that is no more than one size category larger than you with a Power Attack, the creature you attacked is also knocked off balance. Until the beginning of your next turn, it takes a -4 penalty to its CMD against combat maneuvers that move it or knock it prone.
