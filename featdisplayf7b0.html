Like the daring Heaven's Step Offensive championed by Grand Prince Gennaris III of Taldor, you confidently take the fight to your enemy and strike an unexpected blow.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay1802.html?ItemName=Following%20Step">Following Step</a>, <a href="featdisplay1d7f.html?ItemName=Step%20Up">Step Up</a>, <a href="featdisplay4099.html?ItemName=Step%20Up%20and%20Strike">Step Up and Strike</a>, <a href="featdisplay3992.html?ItemName=Two-Weapon%20Fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>, base attack bonus +10.

Benefit: When you make an attack using <a href="featdisplay4099.html?ItemName=Step%20Up%20and%20Strike">Step Up and Strike</a>, you can also make an extra attack with your offhand weapon using your highest base attack bonus. Both attacks take the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting.
