You can turn a missed strike into a second chance without sacrificing later attacks.

Prerequisites: Int 13, <a href="featdisplay465d.html?ItemName=Combat%20Expertise">Combat Expertise</a>, <a href="featdisplayb60c.html?ItemName=Second%20Chance">Second Chance</a>, base attack bonus +11.

Benefit:  When you reroll a missed attack using the Second Chance feat, you can still make the rest of your attacks that turn, albeit at a -5 penalty to each attack.

Normal:  When using the Second Chance feat, you must normally forgo the rest of your attacks that turn.

You can select this feat even if you don't meet the ability score prerequisite (Intelligence 13). You gain the benefits of this feat only as long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool. You can spend 5 stamina points to use Second Chance to reroll any attack after the first in a full attack at the same bonus. If you use Second Chance more than once in the same full attack, the penalties stack.
