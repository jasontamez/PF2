Description

A chipfinder is a handheld device fitted with a circular screen. When a chipfinder is activated, all active tracker chips (see page 52) within a certain radius appear as glowing dots on the screen, indicating the direction and approximate distance to each installed tracker chip, as well identification number for each chip. The screen can filter out unwanted data to make it easier to track a specific chip. Chipfinders are color-coded items; the higher the chipfinder's color rating, the longer its range. This range is a signal, and can be enhanced by a signal booster (see page 51) or blocked by a solid enough barrier.
