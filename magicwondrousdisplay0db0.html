Description

Wearing this animal-hair cloak grants a +1 resistance bonus
on saving throws. Furthermore, the wearer can force its
teeth to grow rapidly up to five times per day as a swift
action. The oversized teeth last for 1 round, during which
time the wearer can make a bite attack. Treat this attack as
a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage
(or 1d4 if the wearer is Small). If the wearer already has a
bite attack, the damage of that bite attack increases by one
step (Bestiary 302).
