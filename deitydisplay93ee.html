Obedience

Cover your hands and arms in a paste made from rotten fruit, spoiled meat, or any other malodorous organic material you create as an offering to Baalzebul, and sit perfectly still with your palms held upward. Wait for flies to gather on your limbs, and let them gorge themselves on the offering while you recount the mighty battles that the Lord of Flies has won in Asmodeus's name. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects.

1: Cocytus's Deception (Sp) lesser confusion 3/day, misdirection 2/day, or glibness 1/day
2: White Angel of Hell (Sp, Su) Baalzebul knows, perhaps a little self-deceptively, that he is the mightiest creature the Prince of Hell has ever created, and from this profane knowledge Baalzebul draws great power. Likewise, in your dark heart you know that you are one of Baalzebul's favored servants, and this knowledge invests you with authority. Whenever a creature senses your aura, such as with detect evil or similar spells, you radiate an aura as if you had 20 Hit Dice. A number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, you gain a +20 bonus on Intimidate checks when you flaunt your association with Hell as part of the check. Additionally, you can cast greater command twice per day as a spell-like ability.
3: Lies of the Son (Sp) Like the Lord of Flies, you can weave a tapestry of lies so convincing that it can wipe the very identity from individuals' minds, and you can cleverly use this ability to your advantage. Once per day, you can cast communal mind blank as a spell-like ability.

Exalted

1: Flies of the Seventh (Sp) decompose corpse 3/day, haunting mists 2/day, distracting cacophony 1/day
2: Master of the Multitudes (Sp) The Lord of Flies happily lends you his hellish servants to further your unholy cause and, of course, his own glory. Once per day, you can summon a swarm of blood-sucking flies to consume your enemies. This functions as per >summon monster VII, except you can summon only a single swarm of blood-draining flies. Treat this swarm as a tick swarm with the fiendish template and a fly speed of 50 feet (perfect maneuverability).
3: Consume Divine Flesh (Su) You relish the thought of the dying Azhia hanging in Baalzebul's home, hellish flies feasting on the forgotten god's flesh for eternity. Your obsession with this macabre act has imbued you with mind-warping abilities to make Baalzebul proud. Three times per day as a standard action, you can target a single living creature within 60 feet. If this creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier), it believes that flies and maggots are infesting its flesh, and it can take no actions for a full round as it claws at its flesh in terror. The imagined pain deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 per Hit Die you have (maximum 20d6). The target can negate this effect with a successful Will saving throw. This is a mind-affecting effect. This ability has no effect on creatures that don't have flesh.

Sentinel

1: Dark Prince's Son (Sp) murderous command 3/day, blur 2/day, burst of speed 1/day
2: Heir of Hell (Su) Even if your companions refuse to acknowledge it, you know that your infernal devotion to and sacrifices for Baalzebul have earned you a place at the side of the greatest fiends of Cocytus, just as the Lord of Flies knows he deserves a place at the side of his dark father. Once per day as a standard action, you can declare your infernal birthright to inspire shock and awe in your enemies. Creatures within 30 feet that hear and oppose you must each attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or be stunned for 1 round and then shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice while contemplating your unholy power. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws are instead shaken for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.
3: Baalzebul's Vengeance (Sp) You can briefly call upon the unfathomable, unholy power of the Lord of Flies to bring down a mighty storm upon those who would oppose you, just as Baalzebul will one day crush all those who stand against him, Hell's servant or not. Once per day as a spell-like ability, you can cast storm of vengeance.
