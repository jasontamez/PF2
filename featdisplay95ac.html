You can catch your opponents on your weapon and hold them in place.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay36c8.html?ItemName=Improved%20Grapple">Improved Grapple</a>, Strength 13, Base Attack Bonus +7.

Benefit: Whenever you damage an opponent with a piercing weapon, you can immediately make a grapple check; success means the opponent is impaled on your weapon and you both gain the grappled condition. While the opponent is impaled, as an attack action you may make a grapple check on your turn at a -4 penalty to damage the opponent with your weapon, even if your weapon cannot normally be used in a grapple.

Normal: You can only attack with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or light weapon against opponents you are grappling.
