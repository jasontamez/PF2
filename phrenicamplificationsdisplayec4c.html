<a href="phrenicamplificationsdisplayec4c.html?ItemName=Phrenic%20Strike">Phrenic Strike</a> (Su) (<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9grw?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Occult-Origins">Occult Origins pg. 16</a>): As long as the psychic has at least 1 point in her phrenic pool, she can attempt an unarmed strike in place of a touch attack as part of casting a spell with a range of touch. This unarmed attack still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless the psychic can otherwise make unarmed attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.
