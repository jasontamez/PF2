Description

Images of ballistae ornament this metallic cloak, which fits easily over armor and other bulky clothing. The wearer can activate this cloak as a swift action, causing the garment to splay outward for 1 round, its jagged hem protruding around the wearer in stiff, sharp points. While the cloak is active, the wearer counts as wearing masterwork armor spikes with which she is proficient, and she can walk on air (as though using the <a href="spelldisplay274d.html?ItemName=air%20walk">air walk</a> spell). If she's riding a mount, the <a href="spelldisplay274d.html?ItemName=air%20walk">air walk</a> effect instead affects the mount while the cloak is active, and the mount can move with the item's help even if it's not specially trained to move with the aid of <a href="spelldisplay274d.html?ItemName=air%20walk">air walk</a>. If the wearer (or her mount) isn't standing on a solid surface by the end of the round, she immediately falls, taking any applicable falling damage.

In addition, on her first successful charge attack during the round the cloak is active, the wearer deals an additional 1d6 points of piercing damage (1d4 if she is Small), plus another 1d6 (or 1d4 if she is Small) for every 20 feet the wearer traveled in a straight line during the charge (maximum 3d6).

This cloak can be activated up to three times per day, but not more often than once per minute.
