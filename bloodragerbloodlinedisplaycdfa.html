One of your ancestors was fey, or the fey realm somehow intermixed with your bloodline. It affects your bloodrage in tricky and surprising ways.

Bonus Feats: Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Step Up, Intimidating Prowess.

Bonus Spells: <a href="spelldisplayc6c2.html?ItemName=Entangle">entangle</a> (7th), <a href="spelldisplay3c6b.html?ItemName=Hideous%20Laughter">hideous laughter</a> (10th), <a href="spelldisplay1929.html?ItemName=Haste">haste</a> (13th), <a href="spelldisplaya744.html?ItemName=Confusion">confusion</a> (16th)

Bloodline Powers: The power of the natural world saturates your being, and manifests itself when you bloodrage.

Confusing Critical (Su): At 1st level, fey power courses through your attacks. Each time you confirm a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be confused for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.

Leaping Charger (Su): At 4th level, you are able to leap over overgrowth and similar impediments with ease while charging. When you charge, you ignore difficult terrain (but not other creatures). You can move through it at normal speed, and it does not impede your charge.

Blurring Movement (Su): At 8th level, you become a blur of motion when you move. As long as you move at least 10 feet, you gain the effects of <a href="spelldisplay14e2.html?ItemName=blur">blur</a> for 1 round.

Quickling Bloodrage (Sp): At 12th level, while bloodraging you're treated as if you are under the effects of <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a>.

One with Nature (Su): At 16th level, creatures of the animal or plant types don't attack you unless compelled to do so by magic or you attack them first. Three times per day, you can transport yourself from one tree to another tree, as <a href="spelldisplaydc68.html?ItemName=tree%20stride">tree stride</a> with half the transport range. Moving from one tree to another in this manner is a move action. You gain these abilities even while not bloodraging.

Fury of the Fey (Su): At 20th level, when entering a bloodrage you can choose one type of creature (and subtype for humanoids or outsiders) that can be affected by the <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">bane</a> weapon special ability. All of your melee attacks are considered to have <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">bane</a> against that type. This ability doesn't stack with other forms of <a href="magicweaponsdisplay5187.html?ItemName=Bane">bane</a>.
