A dinosaur druid speaks for the spirit of prehistoric nature, even taking the form of great beasts of legend.

Summon Dinosaur (Sp):  A dinosaur druid can summon a wide range of dinosaurs and related prehistoric beasts using summon nature's ally spells. She adds the following options to these spells when using spontaneous casting to cast such a spell.

Summon Nature's Ally I: Compsognathus.
Summon Nature's Ally II: Dimorphodon, troodon.
Summon Nature's Ally III: Plesiosaurus, velociraptor.
Summon Nature's Ally IV: Dimetrodon, pachycephalosaurus, parasaurolophus.
Summon Nature's Ally V: Amargasaurus, ceratosaurus, iguanodon, kentrosaurus, styracosaurus.
Summon Nature's Ally VI: Allosaurus, quetzalcoatlus, tylosaurus.
Summon Nature's Ally VII: Therizinosaurus.
Summon Nature's Ally VIII: Diplodocus, spinosaurus.
Summon Nature's Ally IX: Giganotosaurus.

This alters spontaneous casting.

Dinosaur Bond (Ex):  A dinosaur druid must choose an animal companion as her nature's bond, and the animal companion must be a dinosaur (including those detailed in Pathfinder RPG Bestiary volumes).

This alters nature's bond.

Dinosaur Shape (Su):  A dinosaur druid specializes in assuming the form of dinosaurs when using wild shape. When she assumes the form of a dinosaur via wild shape, she gains a +2 size bonus to her Constitution in addition to the other modifiers granted by beast shape. When she uses wild shape to assume the form of a creature other than a dinosaur, the wild shape effect lasts for only 1 minute per level, rather than 1 hour per level.

This alters wild shape.

Primeval Voice (Su):  At 4th level, a dinosaur druid gains the ability to speak with dinosaurs (as per speak with animals) at all times.

This replaces resist nature's lure.
