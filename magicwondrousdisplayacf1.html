Description

Resembling the more common nonmagical doctor's mask, a plaguebringer's mask grants a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against nauseating scents and immunity to one specific disease (the disease must be chosen at the time of the mask's creation-the ones in this adventure grant immunity to <a href="diseases0c53.html?ItemName=Blood%20Veil">blood veil</a>). The mask also veils the wearer's alignment, making her aura register as neutral to alignment-detecting effects.
