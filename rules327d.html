The catalyst section of each corruption offers a number of possible methods for contracting that corruption. Once you contract a corruption, you immediately gain a manifestation. Your manifestation level becomes 1, and your number of manifestations and your manifestation level can increase as described in <a href="rules6b85.html?Name=Manifestation%20Level&amp;Category=Corruption">Manifestation Level</a>. You also draw closer to losing your soul, as represented by your corruption stage. This is described under <a href="rules93ae.html?Name=The%20Corruption's%20Progress&amp;Category=Corruption">The Corruption's Progress</a>.

Multiple Corruptions: Typically, you can have only one corruption. If some exceedingly rare condition arises that would cause you to be affected by more than one, you typically gain stains from both corruptions' manifestations but gifts from only the first one you contracted, and the secondary corruption also grants manifestations at a slower rate. When the text refers to your manifestation level, use only your manifestation level for the second corruption, not the sum of all your manifestation levels.
