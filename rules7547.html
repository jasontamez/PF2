To help explain these rules, the following section includes a number of sample wordspells that could be created using the words of power system.

Burst Fire Blast (magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3): This simple wordspell does 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to anything caught in a 10-footradius burst. If the wordcaster boosts the target word, this wordspell more closely resembles fireball, dealing damage in a 20-foot-radius burst. The targets receive a Ref lex saving throw to halve the damage.

Selected Ice Blast Life Leech (magus 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6): This wordspell causes the target to take 10d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 temporary negative levels, and to become entangled for 1d4 rounds. The target receives either a Fortitude save or a Ref lex save, chosen by the caster. If the save is successful, the target takes half the cold damage, takes no negative levels, and is not entangled. A sorcerer, witch, or wizard can boost the target word to make this spell affect multiple targets, but doing so increases the spell's overall level to 9th.

Selected Alignment Shield Enhance Form Grave Bane (cleric 6): This wordspell grants the target a number of bonuses. First, it grants the target a +2 bonus to AC and on saving throws when it is attacked by creatures of one alignment type (chosen by the wordcaster). The wordspell also grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (chosen by the wordcaster). Finally, the wordspell grants an additional +4 sacred bonus on saving throws made against death spells and death magic effects; the subject cannot gain negative levels while this wordspell is in effect, and the target is automatically stabilized if brought below 0 hit points. All of these effects last for 1 round per level, as that is the duration of the effect word with the shortest duration. Note that alignment shield is only 1st level, and could be replaced with a 2nd-level effect word without changing the overall level of the spell.
