Description

This fine silver circlet is often set with a milky moonstone.
When a wearer places it on his head, the stone quickly goes
dark like the waning moon, and the wearer must make a DC
14 Fortitude saving throw or immediately go blind. The saving
throw must be made each round that the crown is worn until
the wearer succumbs to the blindness. Removing the circlet
requires breaking the curse. In addition to a remove curse spell
or similar effect, remove blindness/deafness can be used to
end the circlet's curse long enough to remove the item.
