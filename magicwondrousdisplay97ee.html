Description

This palm-sized holy symbol is composed of tiny pieces of stained
glass held in a gold frame. The exact symbol is determined upon
the item's creation. As a free action, the creature holding the
ornament can project the image of the holy symbol upon any
creature or surface within 15 feet, similar to using a shadow
puppet and lamp. This light is not bright enough to illuminate
an area. If the bearer is a paladin, she may use her lay on hands ability on a creature touched by the symbol's light (effectively
increasing her lay on hands range from touch to 15 feet).
