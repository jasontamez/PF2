Description

This life-sized carving of a Tiny animal is crafted from dark,
rough stone. It has a hardness of 8 and 20 hit points. A witch
can use the stone familiar to store up to 500 levels of spells
(cantrips count as 1/2 level for this purpose). A witch can use
the stone familiar to teach her living familiar any spells stored
in it, and vice versa. A witch who identifies a stone familiar
immediately knows what spells are stored inside it. A stone
familiar is never found as randomly generated treasure with
spells already stored in it.
