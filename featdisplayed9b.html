You can concentrate even in the direst circumstances,
and know how to retain your magic even when it would
otherwise be wasted.


Prerequisites: Cha 15, Int 15, or Wis 15 (see special).

Benefit:  Whenever you fail a concentration check while
casting defensively and would normally lose a prepared
spell or spell slot, you may attempt a Will save (DC = 15
+ spell level) to retain the spell as though you had not
attempted to cast it. The failed concentration check still
results in the spell's failure, even if the spell is retained.


Special:  To gain the benefits of this feat, you must
meet the prerequisite that matches the ability score you
use to determine your save DCs, bonus spells per day,
and ability to cast spells of a given level. If you gain spells
from multiple classes, you must meet the prerequisite
ability score for each class to gain the benef its of this
feat when casting spells from that class's spell list.
