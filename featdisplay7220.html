Your stare addles your foe's mind.

Prerequisites: Mesmerist level 7th, painful stare class feature.

Benefit: When you trigger your painful stare, the target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your mesmerist level + your Charisma modifier) or else become confused for 1 round. The target must roll twice to determine the result of its confused condition, and you select which roll is used.
