Chain Mastery - Feats







Chain Mastery (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok">Book of the Damned pg. 178</a>
You wield spiked chains with effortless lethality.

Prerequisites: Dex 15, <a href="featdisplay2893.html?ItemName=Exotic%20Weapon%20Proficiency">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (spiked chain).</a>

Benefit: You treat a spiked chain as a one-handed martial weapon for all purposes. You can still choose to wield a spiked chain as a two-handed weapon, and if you do so, you gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm or trip foes with your spiked chain.
