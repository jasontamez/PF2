You are able to emulate the echolocation techniques of bats.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay45f6.html?ItemName=Blind-Fight">Blind-Fight</a>, <a href="featdisplay108f.html?ItemName=Improved%20Blind-Fight">Improved Blind-Fight</a>, Perception 10 ranks.

Benefit: By spending a move action to make a sound and listen for the echoes, you gain blindsense 30 feet until the end of your turn. Using this feat requires making audible sounds that impose a -4 penalty on your Stealth checks.

Special: This feat cannot be used if you are deafened or unable to make noise, and you cannot detect anything in areas that are magically silenced.
