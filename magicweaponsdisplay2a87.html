Description

Typically forged by aeons or other creatures that eschew commonly held structures of morality, unaligned weapons quell the effects of extreme alignments on the wielder. The wielder counts her Hit Dice as 4 lower than her actual total HD when someone attempts to detect her alignment using detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, detect law, or similar spells or effects. Furthermore, if the wielder is an outsider and is targeted by a spell or effect with an alignment descriptor that deals additional damage to or has an additional effect on outsiders (such as holy smite), she adds a bonus equal to the unaligned weapon's enhancement bonus on saving throws she attempts against that spell or effect. Finally, the wielder takes no penalties on her Charisma-, Intelligence-, or Wisdom-based checks from a plane's mildly aligned or strongly aligned traits, regardless of her actual alignment.
