You curse a bleeding opponent with uncertainty.

Prerequisites: Int 13, Use Magic Device 5 ranks.

Benefit: As a standard action, you can curse an enemy you've damaged with a melee attack in the last minute to become hesitant. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or take a -10 penalty on any initiative check it makes in the next minute.

Special: If a shaman or witch uses this blood hex, the target is unable to take a full-attack action for 1 round. This effect can be extended with the cackle hex.
