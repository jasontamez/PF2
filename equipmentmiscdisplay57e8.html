Description

Musicians in the Mwangi Expanse make frequent use of carved harps strung with strings made from natural materials. These harps often feature ornately detailed soundboards and necks shaped like creatures that inhabit the region. Harps crafted from darkwood are very light compared to similar instruments, yet they retain the resonance and tonal quality demanded by the pickiest of musicians. A darkwood Mwangi harp is a masterwork musical instrument (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 78) that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform checks when using it.
