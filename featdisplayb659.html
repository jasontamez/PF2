Your scars bear witness to countless battles.

Prerequisites: Take a cumulative total of 1, 000 points of damage. Magical healing offsets this running total; for every 5 points of magical healing you receive, reduce your cumulative damage total by 1.

Benefit: Your thick scars impart a -2 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks, but increase your natural armor bonus by +2.
