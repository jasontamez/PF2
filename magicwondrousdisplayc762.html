Description

This plush hooded robe is finely trimmed with gold accents. When the wearer casts a spell, the robe scintillates with color and produces ostentatious magical effects, such as bright lights and loud hums, increasing the DC of Spellcraft checks to identify the spell by 10. In addition, once per day as a move action, the wearer can trigger these effects with a dramatic flourish; each creature within 30 feet that can see the wearer must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds.
