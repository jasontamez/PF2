A troop is a collection of creatures that acts as a single creature, similar to a swarm, but as part of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class. A troop attempts saving throws as a single creature.

A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shapeable, though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop provokes an attack of opportunity if it does so. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures.

The exact number of a troop's component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures.

Troop Traits: A troop is not subject to flanking, but it is subject to critical hits and sneak attacks if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 hit points or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop. Until that point, however, any damage taken by the troop does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attacks. A troop is never staggered or reduced to a dying state by damage. Also, a troop cannot be subject to a bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, drag, grapple, reposition, or trip combat maneuver, unless it's affected by area effects that include such effects. A troop can grapple an opponent.

A troop is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <a href="spelldisplay2b8a.html?ItemName=disintegrate">disintegrate</a> and multiple-target spells such as <a href="spelldisplayba59.html?ItemName=haste">haste</a>), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as <a href="spelldisplayb10d.html?ItemName=fireball">fireball</a>). A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If a troop is rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage, it disperses and does not reform until its hit points exceed the nonlethal damage it has taken.

Troop Attack: Creatures with the troop subtype don't make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed. A troop's stat block has "troop" in its Melee entry with no attack bonus given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below, plus its Strength modifier.

<table class="inner"> <tr><td>Troop HD</td><td>Troop Base Damage</td></tr> <tr><td>1-5</td><td>1d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>6-10</td><td>2d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>11-15</td><td>3d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>16-20</td><td>4d6 + Str mod</td></tr> <tr><td>21+</td><td>5d6 + Str mod</td></tr> </table>

Unless stated otherwise, a troop's attacks are nonmagical. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a troop attack's damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature immunity (or at least resistance) to the troop's attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage or deal more damage than their Hit Dice would normally suggest. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and resolve attacks of opportunity by dealing automatic troop damage to any foe in reach who provokes such an attack of opportunity. Troops are still limited to making one such attack per round unless the text states otherwise.

Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a successful caster level check (DC = 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and concentration requires a successful DC 20 Will save.

Looting Troops: Although troops are composed of a number of individual creatures, the chaos and destruction of battle means that not all of these creatures' equipment survives the rigors of combat. As a result, parties who wish to claim usable gear or treasure from slain foes treat a troop as a single creature for the purposes of looting, and should be able to recover gear worth a total value equal to the troop's expected treasure value (as determined by the troop's CR).
