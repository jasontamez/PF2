Description

This item allows its wearer to smell curses as an unearthly odor with traces of brimstone and iron. As a standard action, the wearer can bring its nose near an object or creature and sniff the target to glean information as if using detect magic, except this effect only detects curses and cursed items. The wearer must concentrate as normal to learn all possible information about the object or creature in question.

Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can sniff the air for signs of danger while considering a specific course of action to gain an effect similar to augury. The perceived smell of a favorite food indicates "weal" and the smell of death indicates "woe."
