Quick Draw - Feats







Quick Draw (Combat)

Source <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 131</a>
You can draw weapons faster than most.

Prerequisites: Base attack bonus +1.

Benefit: You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight of Hand skill) as a move action. A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow). Alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands cannot be drawn quickly using this feat.

Normal: Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.

As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, you can sheathe a weapon as a swift action.

Mythic Quick Draw

You can retrieve any item quickly, not just weapons.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay87ec.html?ItemName=Quick%20Draw">Quick Draw.</a>

Benefit:  You can use Quick Draw to draw items of any kind, not just weapons, provided they are stored or concealed on your person. As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve up to two hidden items. You must have two hands free to do so.
