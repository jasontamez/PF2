Strength Normal
The arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir as a standard action and touch a target to grant superficial healing. This stops any bleed effects the target is suffering and grants a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier, lasting for a number of hours equal to the arcanist's level. At 6th level, the number of hit points granted increases to 2d8 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier. A creature can benefit from mending flesh only once per day.
