Your simultaneous ranged attacks punch through your foe's defenses with ease.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay999c.html?ItemName=Point-Blank%20Shot">Point-Blank Shot</a>, elf, weapon familiarity racial trait.

Benefit:  If you and a single ally who also has this feat both ready an action to each make a ranged attack against the same opponent and choose the same condition for the readied action, when you and the ally make those attacks, each of you can use the highest of the two attack rolls for your attack roll. Furthermore, if you and your ally both hit the target, you can total the damage for both attacks before applying the target's damage reduction or energy resistance.
