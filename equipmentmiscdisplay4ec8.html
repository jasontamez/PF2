Description

This framework consists of a small tripod, a spool of wire, and a series of levels. As part of the action to set up the trap, the autosniper is attached to any Small or Medium crossbow and its wire strung across one or two 5-foot squares within 10 feet. Once set, the autosniper fires the attached crossbow automatically at the first Tiny or larger creature that disturbs its tripwire. An autosniper cannot reload the crossbow to which it is attached.

The general bulkiness of an autosniper's framework imposes a -2 penalty on any attempts to use its attached crossbow as a ranged weapon. An autosniper can be removed from a crossbow with 1 minute of work.

This can be crafted with a DC 25 Craft (traps) check.
