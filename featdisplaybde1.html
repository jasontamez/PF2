You catch objects with your ranged attacks and drag them along with you.

Prerequisites: Dex 13, <a href="featdisplay7ebb.html?ItemName=Deadly%20Aim">Deadly Aim</a>, <a href="featdisplay33b2.html?ItemName=Ranged%20Disarm">Ranged Disarm (Ranged Tactics Toolbox 8)</a>, base attack bonus +6, weapon training class feature with a ranged weapon.

Benefit:  You don't take the -2 penalty for attempting disarm combat maneuver checks with a ranged weapon using Ranged Disarm, and you can attempt a steal combat maneuver check instead of a disarm combat maneuver check when using Ranged Disarm. In addition, when you successfully disarm or steal an item from an opponent, that item is deposited in that opponent's square. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds the target's CMD, you can deposit the item 5 feet away from the target (to a maximum of the attack's maximum range or until your projectile strikes an object that it cannot penetrate). If you use this ability with a thrown weapon and have the Ricochet Toss feat, both the weapon and the item return to you.
