Special Abilities

Gancanagh's Grace (Su) A gancanagh's otherworldly grace and flowing movement allow him to add his Dexterity modifier to damage rolls with his rapier in place of his Strength modifier.

Invigorating Passion (Su) A gancanagh's passion has the power to raise those who receive it to great heights. Any creature who performs an act of passion with a gancanagh, such as a kiss, gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls, gains 1 bonus Hit Die (d10) with the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any), and takes no penalties from the fatigued or exhausted conditions. These benefits last for 1 hour. At the end of that time, the creature must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become fatigued, or exhausted if it was already fatigued. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Vulnerable to Smoke (Ex) A gancanagh's lungs can't tolerate smoke. He takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws against smoke and cloud effects, such as stinking cloud and the smoke from pyrotechnics.

Description

Male azatas of extraordinary and radiant beauty, gancanaghs are Elysium's knights-errant, but they are best known as inveterate wooers of mortals and immortals alike. While gancanaghs are incorrigible flirts, a gancanagh's true attention tends to alight on one man or woman at a time, and he throws himself into wooing and courting his current target, into a brief but earnest fling before his quicksilver passions change yet again.

Gancanaghs hate succubi and incubi more than anything else, as they feel that the mere existence of such creatures profanes the spirit of romance with the shadow of the demons' seduction and violence, leading good people who share the gancanagh's flirtatious and open nature to be compared to evil creatures. One can give a gancanagh no greater offense than to mistake him for an incubus, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other ally of good to a duel over such an insult.

While many gancanaghs carry whimsical-looking pipes because they like the way they look, they can't stand smoke, and so rarely make use of them. A gancanagh's flute, on the other hand, is a cherished possession, as they enjoy both the beauty of the music and its ability to sway the heart. A typical gancanagh stands 6 feet tall but weighs only 130 pounds.

Azatas are a race of celestials native to the plane of Elysium, where the pursuit of freedom and goodness is paramount. Azatas are champions of these concepts, great bards, knights, and explorers who roam the planes in search of good folk in need of their help. Frequently described as the most elven or fey-like celestials, azatas nevertheless often have strange, inhuman shapes or can take elemental or eldritch forms. Most have some knightly or courtly title, such as duke, countess, or prince, apparently hereditary, perhaps from a celestial monarchy long abandoned and forgotten. Azatas do not exploit these titles to exert influence over each other, instead using them for personal identification or a bit of self-importance. They are deadly and resolute foes of evil, fearless and clever in battle.

It is not surprising that the three best-known kinds of azatas can all fly, for they rarely stay in one place for long and prefer the thrill of motion and discovery to creature comforts. Most azata "settlements" are little more than a collection of tents around a landmark, gathered over the course of a day to share news, stories, and perhaps good-natured duels, and then packed up again a few days later. Such temporary settlements are colorful and have a celebratory atmosphere, as azatas are quick to greet any of their kind as old friends. Although few can predict when and where an azata community might arise, some groups or breeds of azatas gather in cycles for traditional festivals and reunions. Such gatherings typically take place at a time of mystical consequence, such as on the evening of the lunar equinox, or during less predictable times, such as upon the wedding of two seers, and always in a place of pristine or stunning natural wonder. All azatas fundamentally know when and where the closest or next gathering of their people might occur, and while none are required or even expected to attend, all are welcome. These gatherings do not preclude more permanent azata holdings and communes, however, and the heights of Elysium endlessly ring with the songs of azata choirs.

While the stoic, homebound archons call their cousins flighty, azatas are driven by a crusading nature and feel bored when forced to stay in one place too long. This tendency also means they are unlikely to agree to serve mortals for an extended period of time, preferring to arrive, get the job done, and move on to some other quest or challenge. As much as they seek to spread the cause of freedom and joy, azatas realize that they cannot enforce such virtues throughout the multiverse. Without darkness there can be no light, and without struggle there can be no victory. Understanding this, these celestials remain removed from the majority of mortal conflicts, preferring to act as advisors in such situations rather than champions, granting goodly mortals ownership over their own triumphs. In cases where the forces of evil act overtly, however, and intrude upon mortal worlds, azatas are quick to rally to defend such realms and aid those who have no hope of defending themselves.

Azatas generally work together, but their powerful personalities and strong sense of individual freedom often see them disagreeing on how best to handle a particular situation. While both parties have the greater good at heart, these arguments can fester and grow into long-lasting grudges. In cases where a single azata is convinced his way is right, he might even enter a sort of self-imposed exile, abandoning the support of his kin so he can launch a one-azata crusade against the cruelties of the multiverse.

Most azatas originate from the untamable beauty of Elysium, created and nourished by the influx of goodly mortal souls. Like most other outsiders, they cannot reproduce with each other in the mortal fashion, and often tryst with mortals who prove charming and good spirited. Azatas dally frequently with their own kind, being quick to seek out feelings of love, joy, and companionship, but rarely feel bound or exclusive to merely one lover, regardless of its race.

Azatas speak Celestial, Draconic, and Infernal, but can speak with almost any creature because of their truespeech special ability. See creature subtypes for full details on truespeech and other shared azata traits.
