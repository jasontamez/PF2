You are ready to defend yourself with a spell at a moment's notice.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay8b18.html?ItemName=Combat%20Reflexes">Combat Reflexes</a>, caster level 5th.

Benefit:  If you fail a Perception check that results in you being unable to act in a surprise round, you still roll initiative normally. You can act on your initiative count in the surprise round, but can only take a standard action to cast an abjuration spell that targets only yourself.
