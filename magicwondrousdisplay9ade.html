Description

The haunting strains of any music played on this unusually light, gold-inlaid oak lute travel farther than that of any mundane instrument, as if carried by the wind. If a bard uses this lute to play a bardic performance with a limited range (such as countersong or distraction), the range of the bardic performance increases by 10 feet. If the bard is a sylph, the range increases by 20 feet instead.

Construction

Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, whispering wind, creator must be a sylph with the bardic performance class feature; Cost 2,125 gp
