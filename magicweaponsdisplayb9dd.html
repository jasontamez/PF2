Description

The gold-washed barrel of this
elegant +2 double-barreled pistol
always catches the light, and
its maple grip feels pleasantly
warm to the touch. When its wielder successfully bypasses
an evil creature's damage reduction with a single attack, the
creature's skin cracks into fissures of golden light. This light
negates the creature's DR for the gunslinger and her allies,
fading away after 1 minute.
