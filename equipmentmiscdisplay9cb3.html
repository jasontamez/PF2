Description

This intensely polished steel sphere can be rolled in a manner similar to a thrown splash weapon. Anyone who can clearly see the sphere within 30 feet can notice the presence or absence of movement reflected on its surface, making it useful for checking around corners for guards. A gently rolled ball on a smooth floor requires a DC 10 Perception check to hear.
