Description

This band of reddish fox fur
is marked on the front with a
distinctive symbol that constantly
shifts into a different character.
The headband grants the wearer an
enhancement bonus to one mental
ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4,
or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first
24 hours the headband is worn. This bonus is chosen when
the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the
headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill
ranks as a headband of vast intelligence.

If the wearer is a creature who uses magic to change
form, she gains the following additional benefits.

Shifter's headband +2: The wearer treats her caster level
as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating
extracts of the polymorph subschool.

Shifter's headband +4: Once per day while under the
effect of a polymorph spell or extract, the wearer can
assume another form allowed by that effect. This is a
standard action.

Shifter's headband +6: Whenever the wearer changes her
shape with a polymorph effect, she gains DR 5/silver for 1
minute (this ends if she returns to her natural form).

These additional shapeshifter abilities are cumulative.
For example, a creature wearing a shifter's headband +4
gains the extra transformation ability and treats her caster
level as 1 higher than normal for polymorph spells and
extracts.
