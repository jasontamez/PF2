Description

This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by
2 feet wide. A creature who knows the proper commands can
cause it to perform as follows.
<ul><li>Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as
long as the creature controlling the mirror is within 25 feet
of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown
language.
</li><li>View other places as if with clairvoyance, and the controller
can even view locations on other planes if she is sufficiently
familiar with them.
</li><li>Use it as a portal to visit other places. The controller first
views the place with the clairvoyance function, then
steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others
can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible
portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and
she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the
portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours
(trapping the user if sheâ€™s still in the other place), and the
user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with
Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal
just as they might notice a magical sensor from a scrying
spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears
in front of the mirror.
</li><li>Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short
question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its
surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore
spell).</li></ul>
