Description

Tiny ornaments of gold hang from the links of a charm
bracelet. In addition to 1d4+4 nonmagical charms, each
bracelet carries one of each of the following magic charms.
These magic charms can be activated with a command,
producing the listed effect, but each charm can be only used
once. After a charm is used, it dissolves into a thick vapor
and dissipates.

Arming Sword: When detached, this charm transforms into
a masterwork heavy wooden shield and a masterwork
longsword. They can either appear on the ground or within
the hands of the creature that activated the charm, ready to
use. These items last for 1 hour before turning into vapor.

Healthy Apple: When detached, this charm becomes an apple
that when eaten (a standard action that provokes attacks
of opportunity) heals 2d8 hit points. In addition, if the
creature eating the apple is afflicted with any poison or
diseases, it can attempt a new saving throw against each
such affliction. Each successful saving throw immediately
ends the corresponding affliction.

Loving Heart: Upon detaching this charm, the wearer can use
charm person as a spell-like ability (as the spell, Will DC 11)
any time before the end of her next turn.

Lucky Star: When this charm is activated, it releases good
luck in a 20-foot-radius burst centered on the wearer. The
wearer and her allies within the burst gain a +2 luck bonus
on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill
checks for 1 round.

Peaceful Dove: Detaching this dove calms tempers within a
20-foot-radius burst centered on the wearer as though calm
emotions (Will DC 13) had been cast. A creature affected by
rage takes a â€“2 penalty on this saving throw.
Reduce the price of a charm bracelet that has one or more
expended charms by 1,580 gp per absent charm. The charm
bracelet itself becomes a nonmagical bracelet worth 100 gp when the last charm is used, no matter the number of
nonmagical charms left on the bracelet.
