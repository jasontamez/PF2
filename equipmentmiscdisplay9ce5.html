Description

Razmir's faithful utilize a number of tools to help them control the populace, but few are more insidious than the tears of Razmir. This alchemical concoction contains mild narcotics and hallucinogens that bolster the user's energy and resistance to pain. It is also highly addictive. Although the clergy gives away tears of Razmir to non-users, it eventually demands payment-as much as 10 gp per dose from wealthy addicts. See pages 236-237 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide for additional rules on drugs and addiction.
