Description

When a drinker willingly imbibes this elixir underwater, the elixir of two worlds transforms either a humanoid-shaped land-dwelling creature or a merfolk-shaped sea-dwelling creature instantaneously. A land-dweller's legs transform into a tail fin (granting him a land speed of 5 feet and swim speed of 40 feet) and he gains the aquatic subtype, while a sea-dweller's tail fin transforms into legs (granting him a land speed of 30 feet and no swim speed) and he loses the aquatic subtype. Because the drinker must imbibe it underwater, he must use a potion sponge or a potion sureseal bladder. Further, it's impossible to use alchemical allocation with this elixir. Only miracle, wish, or similar magic, or another elixir of two worlds, can reverse the elixir's effects.
