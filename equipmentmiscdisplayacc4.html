Description

These needles of dried and augmented mugwort ignite at one end when removed from the alcohol in which they are stored. A set of vivifying moxibustion needles can be used to perform a healing procedure on a willing or helpless creature with a successful DC 15 Heal check and 1 hour of effort. Failing the check by 4 or less indicates that nothing happens, while failure by 5 or more deals 1d4 points of damage to the subject. If the procedure is performed successfully, the subject gains a +2 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves against diseases, cold effects, and effects that deal Dexterity or Strength damage for the next 24 hours. If the patient is affected by an ongoing effect that can be resisted with a successful Fortitude save, he can attempt an immediate saving throw to end the effect (using the +2 alchemical bonus if applicable); this final benefit can be gained only once per day.
