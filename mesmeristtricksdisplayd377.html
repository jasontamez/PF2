Reflection of Weakness - Tricks - Mesmerist

<a href="mesmeristtricksdisplayd377.html?ItemName=Reflection%20of%20Weakness">Reflection of Weakness</a>(<a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures">Occult Adventures pg. 41</a>): Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.
