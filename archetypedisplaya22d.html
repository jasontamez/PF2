Druids draw upon the fiercest powers of nature, and tsunamis, typhoons, and whirlpools are among the most powerful forces in the ocean. Tempest tamers are at one with the water and gain the ability to soothe these dangerous phenomena. Tempest tamers can be found in many of Golarion's oceans, but all avoid the spectacular Eye of Abendego-they are all keenly aware of the supernatural origin of that massive hurricane, and they know they cannot quell its fury without first acquiring extraordinary power.

Speech of the Sea: A tempest tamer's bonus language options include Aquan and Auran, in addition to the bonus languages available to the character from her race. However, the tempest tamer does not gain Sylvan as a bonus language option.

This ability alters bonus languages.

Whirlpool Walker (Ex): At 4th level, a tempest tamer can resist winds and the unnatural powers of sea creatures. The tempest tamer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells with the air or water descriptor and the spell-like and supernatural abilities of creatures with the air, aquatic, or water subtype. This bonus also applies to saving throws to avoid damage from a vortex, whirlpool, or similar effects, as well as to saving throws to prevent being pulled into or moved by such effects.

This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

Tempest Wild Shape (Su): At 4th level, a tempest tamer gains the ability to turn herself into a Small water elemental. This ability functions as per the elemental body I spell except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level or until she changes back. Changing form (to an elemental or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

At 6th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Small air elemental. At 8th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Medium air or water elemental, as per elemental body II. At 10th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Large air or water elemental, as per elemental body III. At 12th level, a tempest tamer can use tempest wild shape to change into a Huge air or water elemental, as per elemental body IV.

A tempest tamer can use this ability once per day plus an additional time per day at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter (up to a total of eight times at 18th level). At 20th level, she can use tempest wild shape at will.

This ability replaces wild shape.
