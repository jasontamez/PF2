Your martial meditation extends onto the battlefield.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplayb315.html?ItemName=Improved%20Unarmed%20Strike">Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, ki pool class feature.

Benefit: When you hit with a melee attack against an opponent you have already damaged this round, you can forgo dealing damage to instead regain 1 ki point. This feat can restore only 1 ki point every minute, to a maximum per day of 1 point for every 4 class levels you have.
