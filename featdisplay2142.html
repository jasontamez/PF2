You know how to perform deadly strikes against even the most nebulous of targets.

Prerequisites: <a href="featdisplay2340.html?ItemName=Weapon%20Focus">Weapon Focus</a>, base attack bonus +12.

Benefit: Choose one weapon with which you have the Weapon Focus feat. When you strike an opponent that has a chance of negating critical hits or sneak attacks, such as from the fortification armor special ability, reduce that chance by 25%. Treat creatures that are normally immune to critical hits and sneak attacks as instead having a 75% chance to negate the critical hit or sneak attack, taking only the attack's normal damage.

Special: You can take this feat multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different weapon.
