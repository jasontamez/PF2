Not to be confused with the far more potent earlier strain that swept across Bleakmarch during the reign of Queen Velikas, this infectious disease is characterized by the sufferer's constant shaking, as though he were unable to get warm. The khala dragon (see page 59) is one known carrier of the illness, though many other forms of exposure are possible.
